This repo contains a seq2seq neural network trained on the phonemes of rap lyrics. The architecture is based on Pytorch's basic machine translation tutorial, found here: https://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/seq2seq_translation_tutorial.html. It also contains an implementation of beam search for final answers.

The main code is stored in the ipython file. Ideally you should be able to run all the cells there and your model will start training.

Here are some pictures of predictions and their corresponding attentions. Some things clearly are stil finnickey, but cool none the less.
