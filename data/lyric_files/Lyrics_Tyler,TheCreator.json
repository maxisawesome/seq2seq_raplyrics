Damn!\nCause it's windy!\nBut I love it when your hair...\n\nBlows, when it blows, when it blows\nWhen your hair blows\nHanging out the sunroof\nI love it when your hair blows\nWhen it blows, when it blows, when it blows\nHanging out the sunroof\nI love it when your hair blows\nWhen it blows, when it blows, when your hair blows\nHanging out the sunroof\nListening to Mac DeMarco\nHanging out the roof window\nSwitch to third gear turbo\nSkrting on these niggas\nSkrting on these bitches\nListening to Mac DeMarco\nHanging out the roof window\nSwitch to third gear turbo\nSkrting on these niggas\nSkrting on these bitches\n\nYou can say you don't want to take that drive\nBut your hair, it blows\nI know we'll have a good time\nYou just gotta stop being scared\nJust roll\nJust come and roll with me\nIt's all good\n\nYeah, man,what's good man, you good? I've been chilling, man.

stop\nYou see my shit isn't stock\nI used to piss in a pot and now I piss on the walls\nSince I pissed off a cop, a couple tickets I have copped\nBut I can pay for them all\nAnd by the model of my vehicle you know that I ball\nE92, but '91 the year that Tyler was spawned\nAnd If I crash in the woods then I'ma follow with this\nTiptronic stick or automatic you pick\nShit is static as shit, sure my shit is a M\nMight get that X6 end, don't follow exit him\nMight take back street hidden\nHouse got all sports cars like his garage is gym\nTwo sapphires on him neck next his precious gems\nNow AMG it's in boy I will eat him Benz\nNew engine, you got that old shit with those deep rims\nYou got a warranty don't care if you scratchin rims again\n\nWe can speed in my 2 seater\nGirl I got a 2 seater\nSpeed in my 2 seater\nIn my 2 seater\n\nSit in my passenger seat\nYou tell me I got too much speed\nAnd I should slow, I should slow down\nBut I can't, cause you drive me wild\nGirl I get a rush when we're speeding in my car\nSometimes it's too much\nAnd you can feel the wind in my heart\nGirl I get a rush when we're speeding in my car\nSometimes it's too much\n\nI know some dudes that would find you that carry rugers\nAnd shottas, and fucking shoot at your Honda\nThen fucking zoom out in Mazdas\nThem GOLF boys is bad for you like the food from McDonalds\nBoy, I'm a king and I ain't lyin', boy, hakuna matata\nBetter watch for them hyenas if you flex then they swarm\nCashing so many checks there calling him Tyler O-Comma\nI'm tryna ball like I was Domo O'Connor in '09\nProbably September...\nBoy I'm just rhyming these syllables, suck my genitals\nAlbum cover looking like the mascot of the timberwolves\nSkate park at Pemberton\nHoping that I ditched the chords and go pick up the pen again\nCause I kill the dark shit like I'm motherfucking Zimmerman\nTurn around and lose pounds like I'm fucking Timbaland\nBy pounds, I mean in (beep)\nGive it till he cop brick like a wall with pig in it\nAnd money coming out the blue\nLike cops are changing fits or shit I'm killin' it\n\nBack when Left Brain had the hightop fade\nAnd we would go skate on them concrete waves\nAnd now I switch gears to hear the cylinders pump\nThe beat thump, don't get it twisted boy my board's in the trunk (Skate!)\n\nCan you roll my window up?\nThe fuck you turn my music down for, man?\nCan you roll my window up?\nWhy? Damn!\nCause it's windy!\nBut I love it when your hair...\n\nBlows, when it blows, when it blows\nWhen your hair blows\nHanging out the sunroof\nI love it when your hair blows\nWhen it blows, when it blows, when it blows\nHanging out the sunroof\nI love it when your hair blows\nWhen it blows, when it blows, when your hair blows\nHanging out the sunroof\nListening to Mac DeMarco\nHanging out the roof window\nSwitch to third gear turbo\nSkrting on these niggas\nSkrting on these bitches\nListening to Mac DeMarco\nHanging out the roof window\nSwitch to third gear turbo\nSkrting on these niggas\nSkrting on these bitches\n\nYou can say you don't want to take that drive\nBut your hair, it blows\nI know we'll have a good time\nYou just gotta stop being scared\nJust roll\nJust come and roll with me\nIt's all good\n\nYeah, man,what's good man, you good? I've been chilling, man. I've been doing some push-ups and shit\nFor real?\n50 a day...Oh w-w-wait...is that that nigga Tyler?\nI think so\nBitch ass nigga here he comes, man FUCK this nigga, man, this nigga stink... w-wait be quiet, be quiet\nIght\nMy nigga, T, man, what's good, man, you good?

Ay, your feature don't start for another 20 minutes, so you can go get your shit up, I can go and get some shit... and I see you with your little jewels and shit too, man!\nAw thanks, man, I'm trying, man, I'm just trying\nYeah, let me know if you need anything...I got you...just...you know...yeah\nAlright um...yeah we'll probably walk around and come back when the movie starts whenever\nIght, man, I'mma see you\nIght, my nigga...ight\nErroll:\nFucking FAGGOT, man, I swear to GOD\nYeah\nThis nigga bitch weak too!\nYeah, she is\nGod dammit!

flower on their neck, hit Clancy on the text\nI ain't tryna check a bag, can we get another jet?\nI ain't gas niggas up, but that fuel is 50 grand\nPassionfruit in D.R., had me dripping in the sand\nNew nigga from New York, I'ma give him sticky hands\nSticky fingers from the green, Jasper playing with them grams\nThey was playing at the grams, one nom ain't enough\nI'm a make sure that that shit ain't happening again\nGolf boys, it's them golf boys\nIn that 12 seater wings looking like a hawk boy\nGetting to the paper better reup on the chalk board\nBecause the student turned into the teacher\nDon't talk boy, class in session\n1-5, I'm a 7\nI'ma god nigga ask your reverend\nAnd that crib in Bel-Air is heaven\nHot-coco outta chinas nigga pass the beverage, yeah\nComme Des on that hombre\nHaters with the long face\nNew whip is pirelli tire'd like a long day\nBig dollars, the scent Prada\nSkinny nigga also big poppa, women they adore me\nIf you see me out in public, no pictures don't record me\nI don't really fuck with y'all nigga, selfish at the orgy, uh\n\nBitch\nOne take\nYeah"}}, {"title": "48", "album": "Wolf", "year": "2013-04-01", "lyrics": "Crack fucked up the world,

before you supersized my fries with that dollar\nYou got a daughter, shit's getting harder\nThe only thing you wanna bunk her was your freedom\nYou can't afford to get caught up but you in too deep\nAnd the seashore ain't saw ya\nYou got a mother, she don't support you\nBut you bought her a new house cause you love her\nGrowing up you barely had a roof\nNow you got a couple and it doesn't have a roof\nI guess you\u2019re accustomed what you\u2019re used to\nSo you bought two, nigga\nThey coming for you, nigga\nNiggas be hating I'm doing them bitches\nLike Susan and Karen be doing your pockets\nAnd running the man and he's losing his fucking mind and it\u2019s all an illusion\nWho was alludin' all of this potent\nI am the reason your family is using and shooting up, it\u2019s my fault\nYou can blame me, motherfucker, for killing your aunties and uncles\nThe hustle and hunger, all I wanted was a cheeseburger\nAnd a little chain, tuck, didn\u2019t realize this game fucked up some lives\n\u201cOh, how\u2019s mine?\u201d -- my conscience eats it up all the time\nBut other than that I\u2019m fine, I got a little money in my pocket\n\n48, 48, 48 states I get it in nigga\n48,

call me Mr Treat Your Nose\nIf you really need some blow\nI can get it for the low\n\nNigga, we broke as fuck\nHomie got a chop shop I stole that truck\nAnd I sold that dope\nMotherfuckers hope this nigga go broke\nBut like my work I give no fucks, I\u2019m sorry\nShe could have been a doctor, nigga, I\u2019m sorry\nCould have been an actor and won that Oscar, said, I'm sorry\nI sold that soap and I killed black folk, I\u2019m sorry\nBut I got a nice car, put my sister through school\nWhile my momma all cool, I'm sorry\nI'm in too deep and I can\u2019t see the shore, I'm sorry\n\nYou get addicted to the flip, we used to call it\nYou get addicted to the flip, the transaction, the hustling\nEven more than the money, it's just your job\nYou feel like it's your duty to be the man in between the man\nAnd make this happen for that person, and to do this and do that\nYou become the go to guy forever and next thing you know you\u2019re in too deep\nWay too deep, scare the shit out of you\nYou wind up with so much work, that you'd be scared to death\nIt's important for us to realize man, we gotta get out of that, man\nDudes is buying choppers to shoot down people that look just like them\nDudes is buying guns to take down each other, nobody wins\nYa know what I mean?", "image": "https://images.genius.com/dde81a162bfe7b81092c8630cdf16d70.1000x1000x1.jpg", "artist": "Tyler,

wonder if it fucked with their conscience\nIt fucked with me being out there, I couldn't stand it\nI couldn't stand seeing people fucking themselves up like that on the shit\nAnd that's where the money came from\n\n48, 48, 48 states I get it in nigga\n48, 48, 48 states I get it in nigga\nThey call me Mr. Treat Your Nose\nIf you really need some blow\nI can get it for the low\n48, 48, 48 states I get it in nigga\n48, 48, 48 states I get it in nigga\nThey call me Mr Treat Your Nose\nIf you really need some blow\nI can get it for the low\n(Yeah, nigga)\n\nShit is getting warmer on that corner\nGotta watch out for them 5-0 foreigners\nYour mother is a goner\nI warned you before you supersized my fries with that dollar\nYou got a daughter, shit's getting harder\nThe only thing you wanna bunk her was your freedom\nYou can't afford to get caught up but you in too deep\nAnd the seashore ain't saw ya\nYou got a mother, she don't support you\nBut you bought her a new house cause you love her\nGrowing up you barely had a roof\nNow you got a couple and it doesn't have a roof\nI guess you\u2019re accustomed what you\u2019re used to\nSo you bought two, nigga\nThey coming for you, nigga\nNiggas be hating I'm doing them bitches\nLike Susan and Karen be doing your pockets\nAnd running the man and he's losing his fucking mind and it\u2019s all an illusion\nWho was alludin' all of this potent\nI am the reason your family is using and shooting up, it\u2019s my fault\nYou can blame me, motherfucker, for killing your aunties and uncles\nThe hustle and hunger, all I wanted was a cheeseburger\nAnd a little chain, tuck, didn\u2019t realize this game fucked up some lives\n\u201cOh, how\u2019s mine?\u201d -- my conscience eats it up all the time\nBut other than that I\u2019m fine, I got a little money in my pocket\n\n48, 48, 48 states I get it in nigga\n48, 48, 48 states I get it in nigga\nThey call me Mr Treat Your Nose\nIf you really need some blow\nI can get it for the low\n48, 48, 48 states I get it in nigga\n48, 48, 48 states I get it in nigga\nThey call me Mr Treat Your Nose\nIf you really need some blow\nI can get it for the low\n\nNigga, we broke as fuck\nHomie got a chop shop I stole that truck\nAnd I sold that dope\nMotherfuckers hope this nigga go broke\nBut like my work I give no fucks, I\u2019m sorry\nShe could have been a doctor, nigga, I\u2019m sorry\nCould have been an actor and won that Oscar, said, I'm sorry\nI sold that soap and I killed black folk, I\u2019m sorry\nBut I got a nice car, put my sister through school\nWhile my momma all cool, I'm sorry\nI'm in too deep and I can\u2019t see the shore, I'm sorry\n\nYou get addicted to the flip, we used to call it\nYou get addicted to the flip, the transaction, the hustling\nEven more than the money, it's just your job\nYou feel like it's your duty to be the man in between the man\nAnd make this happen for that person, and to do this and do that\nYou become the go to guy forever and next thing you know you\u2019re in too deep\nWay too deep, scare the shit out of you\nYou wind up with so much work, that you'd be scared to death\nIt's important for us to realize man, we gotta get out of that, man\nDudes is buying choppers to shoot down people that look just like them\nDudes is buying guns to take down each other, nobody wins\nYa know what I mean?"}}, {"title": "911 / Mr.

I wanna\nWin so bad, but I'm not Chicago\nHeart is low, it's real low, it's so low\nYou can't lift me up, I'm like Gallardo\nFrom the start it's been real dark\nIt's been so dark, I guess that you could call me charbroiled, huh\nI'm playin' like Hasbro\nI'm really Saari, call me Arto\nCrashed the McLaren, bought me a Tesla\nI know you sick of me talkin' 'bout cars (skrrt)\nBut what the fuck else do you want from me?\nThat is the only thing keepin' me company\nPurchase some things until I'm annoyed\nThese items is fillin' the void\nBeen fillin' it for so long\nI don't even know if it's shit I enjoy (ohh)\nCurrent battle as an adult\nMy partner is a shadow\nI need love, do you got some I could borrow?\nFuck it, I could find some tomorrow\nBut that never comes\nLike a vasectomy, what have I done?\nI got the talent, the face and the funds\nFound myself long ago but I haven't found someone (who)\nMirror, mirror on the wall (who)\nThe loneliest of them all (me)\nCupid actin' stupid\nDo you got another number I could call?\nNever had a pet\nI've never had a pet\nThere's more fish in the sea\nBut I never had a goldfish to begin with\nI never had a dog\nSo I've never been good with bitches\n'Cause I never threw a ball, fetch\nI never had a pet, that's where it stems from, I bet\nTreat me like direct deposit\nCheck in on me sometime\nAsk me how I'm really doin'\nSo I

time\n911 (You should call me, oh)\n911 (Call me)\n\nYeah, yeah, yeah, yeah\nMy thirst levels are infinity and beyond\nSippin' on that lemonade, I need a Beyonc\u00e9\nCan't see straight, these shades are C\u00e9line Dion\nSucks you can't gas me up, shout out to Elon\nMusk, yeah, I got a sold out show\nCrowd wild out but don't matter 'cause you not front row\nI've been lookin' for a keeper, listen to the speaker\nIf you fit description, hit me on my beeper\nAt that 911\n\nCall me some time (ring, ring, ring)\nPlease bang my line, you know I'll answer (click)\nCall me some time (ring, ring, ring)\nPlease bang my line\n\nCall me\n911, call me some time\nYou should call me\n911, call me some time\n911, (you should call me, oh)\n911, (you should call me)\n\nChirp, chirp\nChirp, chirp\nWoke up in the 'burbs, 'burbs, with the birds, birds\nWhere you used to come and get me with the swerve, swerve\nThese days you gotta find time\nEven the night line\nWork line\nDial nine\n\nFive car garage\nFull tank of the gas\nBut that don't mean nothing, nothing\nNothin', nothin', without you shotgun in the passenger\nI'm the loneliest man alive\nBut I keep on dancing to throw 'em off\nI'm gon' run out of moves 'cause I can't groove to the blues\nIf you know any DJs, tell 'em to call me at 911...\nPart II: Mr. Lonely\n\nI can't even lie, I've been lonely as fuck\nOld lonely ass nigga\nI can't even lie, I've been lonely as fuck\nForreal, you need to go somewhere, like, get some bitches or something\nI can't even lie, I've been lonely as fuck\nOld weird ass nigga\nI can't even lie, I've been\nLonely, lonely, lonely, lonely\n\nThey say the loudest in the room is weak\nThat's what they assume, but I disagree\nI say the loudest in the room\nIs prolly the loneliest one in the room (that's me)\nAttention seeker, public speaker\nOh my God, that boy there is so fuckin' lonely\nWritin' songs about these people\nWho do not exist, he's such a fuckin' phony\nOne thing I know, is that I wanna\nWin so bad, but I'm not Chicago\nHeart is low, it's real low, it's so low\nYou can't lift me up, I'm like Gallardo\nFrom the start it's been real dark\nIt's been so dark, I guess that you could call me charbroiled, huh\nI'm playin' like Hasbro\nI'm really Saari, call me Arto\nCrashed the McLaren, bought me a Tesla\nI know you sick of me talkin' 'bout cars (skrrt)\nBut what the fuck else do you want from me?\nThat is the only thing keepin' me company\nPurchase some things until I'm annoyed\nThese items is fillin' the void\nBeen fillin' it for so long\nI don't even know if it's shit I enjoy (ohh)\nCurrent battle as an adult\nMy partner is a shadow\nI need love, do you got some I could borrow?\nFuck it, I could find some tomorrow\nBut that never comes\nLike a vasectomy, what have I done?\nI got the talent, the face and the funds\nFound myself long ago but I haven't found someone (who)\nMirror, mirror on the wall (who)\nThe loneliest of them all (me)\nCupid actin' stupid\nDo you got another number I could call?\nNever had a pet\nI've never had a pet\nThere's more fish in the sea\nBut I never had a goldfish to begin with\nI never had a dog\nSo I've never been good with bitches\n'Cause I never threw a ball, fetch\nI never had a pet, that's where it stems from, I bet\nTreat me like direct deposit\nCheck in on me sometime\nAsk me how I'm really doin'\nSo I never have to press that 911\n\nOhh!

we could eat\nMake you nauseous, but be cautious, this is not Dawson's Creek\nWe could sneak away, fuck it, you could bring an eighth\nI'm not gon' smoke, but I'm just asking baby; \u0441ould you meet me by the lake?\nSaid bring a towel, well baby meet me by the lake\nBathing suit, it's going down, shit just meet me by the lake\nWe could count the shooting stars, well could you meet me by the lake?\nSummer never has to end with me\n\nI packed a couple sandwiches inside that basket\nAnd brought some extra towels if anyone was asking\nWe should take a dip in that lake quick and then split\nThen do something that's beyond what we both can imagine\n\nWatch the sunset, we can watch the sunset, grab a drink\nWatch the sunset, we can watch the sunset, look in the sky\nWatch the sunset, we can watch the sunset, we never have to leave\nWatch the sunset (There goes the rainbow)\nWatch the sunset, we can watch the sunset (We can stay here)\nWatch the sunset, we can watch the sunset (All night long)\nWatch the sunset, we can watch the sunset\nWatch the sunset (There goes the rainbow)\nWatch the sunset, we can watch the sunset (Look)\nWatch the sunset, we can watch the sunset\nWatch the sunset, we can watch the sunset\nWatch the sunset (Let's go to sleep)\nWe're here, all night, school is in session\nLook, you know, the water's pretty deep, let's go to sleep"}}, {"title": "Answer", "album": "Wolf", "year": "2013-04-01", "lyrics": "Can we talk on the phone or something\nBecause when I call (you on the phone)\nI hope you pick up your phone\nI'd like to talk to you\nI hope you answer\nI hope you answer\nYeah, I hope you answer\nI hope you answer\nYeah, I hope you answer\nBecause when I call\nI hope you pick up your phone\nI'd like to talk to you\nI hope you answer\n\nHey Dad, it's me, um...\nOh, I'm Tyler, I think I'd be your son\nSorry, I called you the wrong name, see, my brain's splitting\n\"Dad\" isn't your name, see \"Faggot's\" a little more fitting\nMom was only twenty when you ain't have any fucks to spare\nYou Nigerian fuck, now I'm stuck with this shitty facial hair\nAlso stuck with a beautiful home with a case of stairs\nSo you not being near fucking fire-started my damn career\nBut fuck it, I got Clancy, he gave me the chance to see\nA world I wasn't supposed to, I'm stoked that I didn't know you\nBut sucks you ain't give a fuck and considered a sperm donor now\nThe fuck is an Okonma? I'm changing my shit to Haley\nAnd I just ain't being passive, nigga\nYou a fucking faggot, nigga\nGot a show on Monday, guess who ain't getting no passes, nigga?\nBut if I ever had the chance to ask this nigga\nAnd call him...\nI hope he answer\n\nI hope you answer\nI hope you answer\nI hope you answer\nYeah, I hope you answer\nBecause when I call (When I call, baby)\nI hope you pick up your phone (Please pick up)\nI'd like to talk to you\n(I hope you answer)\n\nSuck my fucking dick and swallow this case of nuts\nAce hates your guts, I'm a selfish fuck\nAnd I ain't sharing green as if I'm facing blunts\nFrank is out the closet, Hodgy's an alcoholic\nSyd might be bipolar, but fuck it, I couldn't call it\nSupposed to be gone til November but quickly came back in August\nI left two months through September to clearly remember all this\nI would like to tell my grandma, but she just nostalgia\nI'll call her number\nBut she won't answer\n\nI hope you answer\nI hope you answer\nI hope you answer\nYeah, I hope you answer\n'Cause when I call (When I call, baby)\nI hope you pick up your phone\n(I'd like to talk to you)\nI hope you answer\n\nYou claim to hate my fucking guts\nBut say I'm on a island in Thailand and I was wilding\nAnd, if I got stranded had to man up and hold my nuts\nAnd hope that I could live off salt water and fucking coconuts\nPhone ain't got no service -- this 3G is fucking worthless\nDay is getting dark like the area's turning urban\nYou'll be fucking nervous like me inside of a church is\nBut, I'mma get in contact regardless, and\nI hope you answer\n\nThat last verse was about this girl.

I got Clancy, he gave me the chance to see\nA world I wasn't supposed to, I'm stoked that I didn't know you\nBut sucks you ain't give a fuck and considered a sperm donor now\nThe fuck is an Okonma? I'm changing my shit to Haley\nAnd I just ain't being passive, nigga\nYou a fucking faggot, nigga\nGot a show on Monday, guess who ain't getting no passes, nigga?\nBut if I ever had the chance to ask this nigga\nAnd call him...\nI hope he answer\n\nI hope you answer\nI hope you answer\nI hope you answer\nYeah, I hope you answer\nBecause when I call (When I call, baby)\nI hope you pick up your phone (Please pick up)\nI'd like to talk to you\n(I hope you answer)\n\nSuck my fucking dick and swallow this case of nuts\nAce hates your guts, I'm a selfish fuck\nAnd I ain't sharing green as if I'm facing blunts\nFrank is out the closet, Hodgy's an alcoholic\nSyd might be bipolar, but fuck it, I couldn't call it\nSupposed to be gone til November but quickly came back in August\nI left two months through September to clearly remember all this\nI would like to tell my grandma, but she just nostalgia\nI'll call her number\nBut she won't answer\n\nI hope you answer\nI hope you answer\nI hope you answer\nYeah, I hope you answer\n'Cause when I call (When I call, baby)\nI hope you pick up your phone\n(I'd like to talk to you)\nI hope you answer\n\nYou claim to hate my fucking guts\nBut say I'm on a island in Thailand and I was wilding\nAnd, if I got stranded had to man up and hold my nuts\nAnd hope that I could live off salt water and fucking coconuts\nPhone ain't got no service -- this 3G is fucking worthless\nDay is getting dark like the area's turning urban\nYou'll be fucking nervous like me inside of a church is\nBut, I'mma get in contact regardless, and\nI hope you answer\n\nThat last verse was about this girl.

"Life after death, death after life\nMade mistakes before, I swear I wasn't gonna do it twice\nYou love me and it wouldn't change\nSo I'm by myself which will remain the same\nAnd it was just one girl who left me sprung\nAnd it was just one girl who had me going dumb\nAnd it was just one girl who was where I was from\nGave me her feelings and I left that bitch with none\n\nI was in love, but I jumped out quick\nGave her my heart, she broke it, put it in the bucket\nOn another level I'm bitter, I wanted to keep her\nBut now this shit is coming out your speaker\nWish that you could meet her\nBut she's chopped up in my freezer\nBy the mixed vegetables, I'll eat her\nLooking in the iris, I knew she was lying\nCuz she wasn't crying, laughing\nSo I starting grabbing\nAnd she started gasping for air\nShe told me the truth, I didn't care\nThe dead made me win\nAnd her death made me grin\nLike a mouth with a side of nipples and limbs\nThis the end, yeah\nPotatoes and grits on the plate of her\nI should have stayed away from her\nBut she cheated\nAnd now she's in my freezer bleeding\nHer parents looking for her, good luck\nYou dirty bitch\n\nMet the bitch, tied the bitch up\nAnd then I ate her up because she want to go and fuck my cousin up\nNigga's balls in the room and now this bitch is mad at me cause I made a song with autotune with my nigga G\nShe looking at me all mad and all sad\nBut now I'm glad that she's wrapped up in that Glad bag\nAnd that shit's all black and I'm wearing all black\nAnd now she mad cause I found out she was fucking, sucking other niggas\nBusting, cumming, running, here I'm coming with a motherfucking knife and now I'm gunning\nAnd now this bitch is screaming for help, yelp, dealt, the motherfucking card that she dealt\nBut that's her fucking fault, I don't give a fuck\nI fucking more, she fucking one and now these cases that I caught\nShit, but I ain't even fucking tripping\nI need a new chick, I'm sick of dealing with these bitches\n\nIn the club, niggas in the club", "image": "https://images.genius.com/e8d6a379d9f9cf188e3324cf11ca5754.630x630x1.jpg", "artist": "Tyler, The Creator", "raw": {"annotation_count": 22,

"Life after death, death after life\nMade mistakes before, I swear I wasn't gonna do it twice\nYou love me and it wouldn't change\nSo I'm by myself which will remain the same\nAnd it was just one girl who left me sprung\nAnd it was just one girl who had me going dumb\nAnd it was just one girl who was where I was from\nGave me her feelings and I left that bitch with none\n\nI was in love, but I jumped out quick\nGave her my heart, she broke it, put it in the bucket\nOn another level I'm bitter, I wanted to keep her\nBut now this shit is coming out your speaker\nWish that you could meet her\nBut she's chopped up in my freezer\nBy the mixed vegetables, I'll eat her\nLooking in the iris, I knew she was lying\nCuz she wasn't crying, laughing\nSo I starting grabbing\nAnd she started gasping for air\nShe told me the truth, I didn't care\nThe dead made me win\nAnd her death made me grin\nLike a mouth with a side of nipples and limbs\nThis the end, yeah\nPotatoes and grits on the plate of her\nI should have stayed away from her\nBut she cheated\nAnd now she's in my freezer bleeding\nHer parents looking for her, good luck\nYou dirty bitch\n\nMet the bitch, tied the bitch up\nAnd then I ate her up because she want to go and fuck my cousin up\nNigga's balls in the room and now this bitch is mad at me cause I made a song with autotune with my nigga G\nShe looking at me all mad and all sad\nBut now I'm glad that she's wrapped up in that Glad bag\nAnd that shit's all black and I'm wearing all black\nAnd now she mad cause I found out she was fucking, sucking other niggas\nBusting, cumming, running, here I'm coming with a motherfucking knife and now I'm gunning\nAnd now this bitch is screaming for help, yelp, dealt, the motherfucking card that she dealt\nBut that's her fucking fault, I don't give a fuck\nI fucking more, she fucking one and now these cases that I caught\nShit, but I ain't even fucking tripping\nI need a new chick, I'm sick of dealing with these bitches\n\nIn the club, niggas in the club"}}, {"title": "Awkward", "album": "Wolf", "year": "2013-04-01", "lyrics": "I was 16 when we first laid eyes\nScrawny little fucker, yeah, I was that guy\nAnd you was down for the weekend\nI was down for the greetings\nAnd you eyes the same color shit that Jasper be chiefing\nCouple freckles on ya noses, roses made you blush\nGentleman I was like I wasn't tryna fuck\nBut it was my first offical date so I was stuck, like\nIt was past curfew, and we was at the Grove\nAnd it was raining, and I had to be home\nAnd then you grab my hand, talking about tryna get home safe or something\nAll I remember was your motherfucking face\n\nI play in your hair as you rub on my ears\nThen we awkwardly stare until our lips locked\nThen we awkwardly stared because our lips locked\nNow it's awkward in here because our lips locked\nFeels like i\u2019m floating in air\nCan't believe that this dare turned into a reality when our lips locked\nMan, this feels like a dream because our lips locked\nYou officially put my feelings inside a Ziplock bag\n\nYou gotta a nigga sprung, whenever I\u2019m holding your hand and\nMaking eye contact I feel like the damn man\nCause even though I am and get round of applauses\nI\u2019m insecure and start to think that I do not stand chance\nBut, moments, wish that I can own it or lease it or clone it\nCause holding your fingertips is golden\nI fucking love you, now treat my palms like a bowling ball and\nGrip and keep holding on girl\n\nI play in your hair as you rub on my ears\nThen we awkwardly stare until our lips locked\nThen we awkwardly stared because our lips locked\nNow it's awkward in here because our lips locked\nFeels like i\u2019m floating in air\nCan't believe that this dare turned into a reality when our lips locked\nMan, this feels like a dream because our lips locked\nYou officially put my feelings inside a Ziplock bag\n\nYou got a nigga...Wait\nDon't think this is going to work\nThings got complicated and a couple feelings got hurt\nI haven\u2019t talked to you in a couple of days\nI got too comfortable\nAnd started to think that we was really a couple\nBut hey, at least there was time spent\nBut by the time you hear this you won't know what these rhymes meant\nBut when you realize, its awkward, your name still my password\nSo I\u2019m always fucking reminded\nYou got a nigga sprung\n\nYou're my girlfriend.. you're my girl (whether you like it or not!)\nYou're my girl.. you're my girlfriend, you're my girl girlfriend\nYou're my girl, you're my girlfriend, you're my girl (Shit I know that you're my)\nYou're my girl, you're my girlfriend, you're my girlfriend\nYou're my girl.. oooo\nYou're my, you're my Girl\nOoooo girlfriend... girlfriend..\nYou're my girlfriend

greetings\nAnd you eyes the same color shit that Jasper be chiefing\nCouple freckles on ya noses, roses made you blush\nGentleman I was like I wasn't tryna fuck\nBut it was my first offical date so I was stuck, like\nIt was past curfew, and we was at the Grove\nAnd it was raining, and I had to be home\nAnd then you grab my hand, talking about tryna get home safe or something\nAll I remember was your motherfucking face\n\nI play in your hair as you rub on my ears\nThen we awkwardly stare until our lips locked\nThen we awkwardly stared because our lips locked\nNow it's awkward in here because our lips locked\nFeels like i\u2019m floating in air\nCan't believe that this dare turned into a reality when our lips locked\nMan, this feels like a dream because our lips locked\nYou officially put my feelings inside a Ziplock bag\n\nYou gotta a nigga sprung, whenever I\u2019m holding your hand and\nMaking eye contact I feel like the damn man\nCause even though I am and get round of applauses\nI\u2019m insecure and start to think that I do not stand chance\nBut, moments, wish that I can own it or lease it or clone it\nCause holding your fingertips is golden\nI fucking love you, now treat my palms like a bowling ball and\nGrip and keep holding on girl\n\nI play in your hair as you rub on my ears\nThen we awkwardly stare until our lips locked\nThen we awkwardly stared because our lips locked\nNow it's awkward in here because our lips locked\nFeels like i\u2019m floating in air\nCan't believe that this dare turned into a reality when our lips locked\nMan, this feels like a dream because our lips locked\nYou officially put my feelings inside a Ziplock bag\n\nYou got a nigga...Wait\nDon't think this is going to work\nThings got complicated and a couple feelings got hurt\nI haven\u2019t talked to you in a couple of days\nI got too comfortable\nAnd started to think that we was really a couple\nBut hey, at least there was time spent\nBut by the time you hear this you won't know what these rhymes meant\nBut when you realize, its awkward, your name still my password\nSo I\u2019m always fucking reminded\nYou got a nigga sprung\n\nYou're my girlfriend.. you're my girl (whether you like it or not!)\nYou're my girl.. you're my girlfriend, you're my girl girlfriend\nYou're my girl, you're my girlfriend, you're my girl (Shit I know that you're my)\nYou're my girl, you're my girlfriend, you're my girlfriend\nYou're my girl.. oooo\nYou're my, you're my Girl\nOoooo girlfriend... girlfriend..\nYou're my girlfriend you're my girl girlfriend you're my girl\nYou're my

Tyler, hi, I'm Dr. TC and um, I'm guessing that your teacher sent you here to talk cause you were misbehaving\nUm, it's gonna be three sessions: today, tomorrow, and the next day\nSo, just tell me something about yourself...\nWell, look, if you don't talk, I mean, these sessions are going to go slower\n\nThis is what the devil plays before he goes to sleep\nSome food for thought? This food for death, go ahead and fucking eat\nMy father's dead, well I don't know, we'll never fucking meet\nI cut my wrist and play piano cause I'm so depressed\nSomebody call the pastor, this bastard is so possessed\nThis meeting just begun, nigga I'm Satan's son\n\nMy mother raised me a single parent so it's apparent\nThat I got love for my mother, none of you other fuckers\nAre much important I'm getting angrier while recording\nI'm feeling like the bulls, I've got a gang of wolves\nOdd Future is children that's fucked up in they mental\nSimple but probably not, fuck them\n\nI'm tall, dark, skinny, my ears are big as fuck\nDrunk white girls the only way I'll get my dick sucked\nSuspended from school coolest nigga without effort\nEasy to spot like black bitches with fake leopard\nSoak me up in a tampon, but keep the lamp on\nCause this album pack enough evil\nThat you can't fit inside a Jansport, go to school with this\n\nI go from AP to JC inside a fucking week\nWaking up with random girls like \"Yo, bitch, how the fuck we meet?\"\nI stay with grandma, she always bitching about her carpet\nEvery time I walk inside the house, she always tend to start shit\nNo to drugs I never spark it, I used to be bullied for honor classes\nBy those that were slow as molasses, take this shit to school\n\nRaquel treat me like my father like a fucking stranger\nShe still don't know I made Sarah to strangle her\nNot put her in danger and chop her up in the back of a Wrangler\nAll because she said no to homecoming, demons running\nInside my heads telling me evil thoughts\nI'm the dream catcher but nothing but nightmares I caught, go to sleep\n\nI wear green hats because I'm fortunately lucky\nFuck me the monster said, somehow the monster's dead\nInside of me, but the thoughts it tells me are still evil\nWith this state of mind, big moves, Max Keeble\nI'm on my grind feeble, my music is either\nA fucking sin or too illegal play this shit in church\n\nI graduated without honors or fucking father\nHe died (I'm so sorry) No bitch, don't even fucking bother\nI wanted a brother my mother I told her\nBut instead I got a sister, just like me with her mister nada\nSo both of our imaginations are creations of the fucking situation\nThat's having our brains racing like Dayton, wearing some fucking Heelys\n\nI know you fucking feel me, I want to fucking kill me\nBut times I'm so serious you think I'm silly\nI'm doing Big Style Willy couldn't touch 11\nSeven, what's religion nigga? I am legend\nI roll with skaters and musicians with an intuition\nI created O.F. cause I feel we're more talented\nThan 40 year old rappers talking about Gucci\nWhen they have kids they haven't seen in years, impressing their peers\nWith the same problem, the only way to solve them\nIs to go to Father's Day convention with a gold revolver\nLife's a salad, I'm a toss it, eat that shit up, Rick Ross it\nShit it out, bag it up, sell it, I'm so damn rebellious\nCause my mother let me do what I want\nShe wasn't careless, protective she is the bear\nThe shit is so bare, my diary isn't hid\nMy father didn't give a fuck, so it's something I inherit\nMy mom is all I have so it's never meet the parents\nWhen Danielle or Milan decide to fucking share\nThis confused boy, I wanna hug hoy, I\u2019m bad for you kids to listen to\nSoy is not the choice, I'm bad milk, drink it\n\nWhoa, umm, it seems you had a lot to say\nUh, who knows I might feel as I'm evaluating\n\nMy wrist is all red from the cutter\nDripping cold blood like the winter, the summer\nIs never that's equivalent to me and Sarah\nWell that's not her fucking name, but I think this shit is clever\nMy niggas wanna know if I'm fucking, if I'm kissing\nBut I'm sitting here downing beers simply just wishing\nWith a tear they try to tell me but I never listen\nCause I don't give a shit like sitting down pissing\nEighteen, still talking to imaginaries\nHopefully they see the talent I carry just like Jimmy\nLosers can never win me, you can never offend me\nMy goal in life is a Grammy, hopefully momma will attend the\nCeremony with all my homies, I'm suicidal\nThis my Zombie Circus, I hope the majors heard this\nFuck a deal, I just want my father's email\nSo I can tell him how much I fucking hate him in detail\n\nWow, umm, so Tyler if you had the chance to tell him something\nWhat would you tell him?", "image": "https://images.genius.com/cb0b25f99dd81109efa8db270a933a38.500x500x1.jpg", "artist": "Tyler, The Creator", "raw": {"annotation_count": 81, "api_path": "/songs/2093", "description": {"dom": {"tag": "root", "children": [{"tag": "p", "children": ["As the essential introduction to his solo musical personality, Tyler goes back and forth with a fictional psychiatrist denominated \u201cDr. TC\u201d in the form of nine unmistakably remarkable verses."]}, "", {"tag": "p", "children": ["This song featured intense charisma, trait that attracted many followers to the Odd Future movement and was widely hailed as one of OFWGKTA\u2019s best musical endeavors.

covers, videos and all that shit\nFuck you post-Drake-ass cliche-jerking, LA-slauson rapping\nFuck-nigga-ass Hypebeast niggas, now back to the album\n\nWell, Tyler, hi, I'm Dr. TC and um, I'm guessing that your teacher sent you here to talk cause you were misbehaving\nUm, it's gonna be three sessions: today, tomorrow, and the next day\nSo, just tell me something about yourself...\nWell, look, if you don't talk, I mean, these sessions are going to go slower\n\nThis is what the devil plays before he goes to sleep\nSome food for thought? This food for death, go ahead and fucking eat\nMy father's dead, well I don't know, we'll never fucking meet\nI cut my wrist and play piano cause I'm so depressed\nSomebody call the pastor, this bastard is so possessed\nThis meeting just begun, nigga I'm Satan's son\n\nMy mother raised me a single parent so it's apparent\nThat I got love for my mother, none of you other fuckers\nAre much important I'm getting angrier while recording\nI'm feeling like the bulls, I've got a gang of wolves\nOdd Future is children that's fucked up in they mental\nSimple but probably not, fuck them\n\nI'm tall, dark, skinny, my ears are big as fuck\nDrunk white girls the only way I'll get my dick sucked\nSuspended from school coolest nigga without effort\nEasy to spot like black bitches with fake leopard\nSoak me up in a tampon, but keep the lamp on\nCause this album pack enough evil\nThat you can't fit inside a Jansport, go to school with this\n\nI go from AP to JC inside a fucking week\nWaking up with random girls like \"Yo, bitch, how the fuck we meet?\"\nI stay with grandma, she always bitching about her carpet\nEvery time I walk inside the house, she always tend to start shit\nNo to drugs I never spark it, I used to be bullied for honor classes\nBy those that were slow as molasses, take this shit to school\n\nRaquel treat me like my father like a fucking stranger\nShe still don't know I made Sarah to strangle her\nNot put her in danger and chop her up in the back of a Wrangler\nAll because she said no to homecoming, demons running\nInside my heads telling me evil thoughts\nI'm the dream catcher but nothing but nightmares I caught, go to sleep\n\nI wear green hats because I'm fortunately lucky\nFuck me the monster said, somehow the monster's dead\nInside of me, but the thoughts it tells me are still evil\nWith this state of mind, big moves, Max Keeble\nI'm on my grind feeble, my music is either\nA fucking sin or too illegal play this shit in church\n\nI graduated without honors or fucking father\nHe died (I'm so sorry) No bitch, don't even fucking bother\nI wanted a brother my mother I told her\nBut instead I got a sister, just like me with her mister nada\nSo both of our imaginations are creations of the fucking situation\nThat's having our brains racing like Dayton, wearing some fucking Heelys\n\nI know you fucking feel me, I want to fucking kill me\nBut times I'm so serious you think I'm silly\nI'm doing Big Style Willy couldn't touch 11\nSeven, what's religion nigga? I am legend\nI roll with skaters and musicians with an intuition\nI created O.F. cause I feel we're more talented\nThan 40 year old rappers talking about Gucci\nWhen they have kids they haven't seen in years, impressing their peers\nWith the same problem, the only way to solve them\nIs to go to Father's Day convention with a gold revolver\nLife's a salad, I'm a toss it, eat that shit up, Rick Ross it\nShit it out, bag it up, sell it, I'm so damn rebellious\nCause my mother let me do what I want\nShe wasn't careless, protective she is the bear\nThe shit is so bare, my diary isn't hid\nMy father didn't give a fuck, so it's something I inherit\nMy mom is all I have so it's never meet the parents\nWhen Danielle or Milan decide to fucking share\nThis confused boy, I wanna hug hoy, I\u2019m bad for you kids to listen to\nSoy is not the choice, I'm bad milk, drink it\n\nWhoa, umm, it seems you had a lot to say\nUh, who knows I might feel as I'm evaluating\n\nMy wrist is all red from the cutter\nDripping cold blood like the winter, the summer\nIs never that's equivalent to me and Sarah\nWell that's not her fucking name, but I think this shit is clever\nMy niggas wanna know if I'm fucking, if I'm kissing\nBut I'm sitting here downing beers simply just wishing\nWith a tear they try to tell me but I never listen\nCause I don't give a shit like sitting down pissing\nEighteen, still talking to imaginaries\nHopefully they see the talent I carry just like Jimmy\nLosers can never win me, you can never offend me\nMy goal in life is a Grammy, hopefully momma will attend the\nCeremony with all my homies, I'm suicidal\nThis my Zombie Circus, I hope the majors heard this\nFuck a deal, I just want my father's email\nSo I can tell him how much I fucking hate him in detail\n\nWow, umm, so Tyler if you had the chance to tell him something\nWhat would you tell him?"}}, {"title": "Bastard (Kazakh Translation)", "album": null, "year": "2017-02-01", "lyrics":

shake it until the wet sweat\nCrawls right down the crack of your ass\nBooty meets snack, back that ass up\nUntil you come back up and lick my sack up\nI'm Tyler the Creator, hang with thrashers and skaters\nI do sound like Darth Vader\nBut that's not stoppin' me from eatin' your muffin\nI think you and your friends\nShould come with me to get your salad tossed\nCause when I make this stew\nIn

I don't give a fuck and or even listen like Schindler\nShe's cute but her forehead's big\nGot stretch marks like she got four kids\nHer legs can't close like the four door hinge Bronco\nThat O.J. killed the white whores with\nA wealthy white girl without the facelift\nLure her with expensive dinners and a nice bracelet\nLeave the bitch breathless, what the bitch don't know is that\nI'm a mothafuckin' sellout and a rapist\n\nBaby, you're an angel\nHow about we turn this into a fable of some sort?\nYou already know you're dead\nIronic cause your lipstick is red, of course\nI stuff you in the trunk, drunk\nCause all I really wanna do is fuck and snort blow\n\nIf this was a game, I would be considered a mothafuckin' legend\nAnd I ain't trying to gas you up like Chevron\nBut I'm high as fuck bitch, you really need to get on my leverage\nNow we're in the cabin, in the middle of uhh\nTrying to find ways to really stuff you in my cabinet\nDreamy little bastard, I done ran outta luck now\nIt's time for a bloody foot you little rabbit\nYou're very attractive, and notice that\nMy hat is always the color of cactus\nAnd I hang with wolves cause I'm an evil bastard\nPictures of you on my wall no glue, no tape but just cum plastered\nMet you at my school, departed at my house\nEnded at your panties, started at your blouse\nPushed you down stairs, I took a nap up on the couch\nIf you wanted a date, don't come\nNow you gotta make it easy for me don't run\nYou call this shit kids, well I call these kids cum\nAnd you call this shit rape but I think that rape's fun\nWait, now it's about eight something\nIt's late and you stuck in my basement\nCome downstairs with nothing but a shoe string\nYeah bitch this date's done\n\n\nI like my girls how I like my drugs, white\nLord, you're

I'm 'bout to buy her dinner\nMy steak good, I got a good cut like Splinter\nJuicy and hot such a black bitch temper\nNow she wanna talk and chop it up like a blender\nBut I don't give a fuck and or even listen like Schindler\nShe's cute but her forehead's big\nGot stretch marks like she got four kids\nHer legs can't close like the four door hinge Bronco\nThat O.J. killed the white whores with\nA wealthy white girl without the facelift\nLure her with expensive dinners and a nice bracelet\nLeave the bitch breathless, what the bitch don't know is that\nI'm a mothafuckin' sellout and a rapist\n\nBaby, you're an angel\nHow about we turn this into a fable of some sort?\nYou already know you're dead\nIronic cause your lipstick is red, of course\nI stuff you in the trunk, drunk\nCause all I really wanna do is fuck and snort blow\n\nIf this was a game, I would be considered a mothafuckin' legend\nAnd I ain't trying to gas you up like Chevron\nBut I'm high as fuck bitch, you really need to get on my leverage\nNow we're in the cabin, in the middle of uhh\nTrying to find ways to really stuff you in my cabinet\nDreamy little bastard, I done ran outta luck now\nIt's time for a bloody foot you little rabbit\nYou're very attractive, and notice that\nMy hat is always the color of cactus\nAnd I hang with wolves cause I'm an evil bastard\nPictures of you on my wall no glue, no tape but just cum plastered\nMet you at my school, departed at my house\nEnded at your panties, started at your blouse\nPushed you down stairs, I took a nap up on the couch\nIf you wanted a date, don't come\nNow you gotta make it easy for me don't run\nYou call this shit kids, well I call these kids cum\nAnd you call this shit rape but I think that rape's fun\nWait, now it's about eight something\nIt's late and you stuck in my basement\nCome downstairs with nothing but a shoe string\nYeah bitch this date's done\n\n\nI like my girls how I like my drugs, white\nLord, you're so pretty, lying in my arms\nI just got one request, stop breathing"}}, {"title": "BLOW MY LOAD", "album": "Cherry Bomb", "year": "2015-04-13", "lyrics": "I don't want you thinking I love you cause I stay\nGirl I really like you and happy we got laid\nI think about your windows like two times in a day\nI'm a pervert with a purpose, like priest who just got saved\nKissing, kissing, I'm on a mission of licking\nThe holy grail of your body, when you be kissin', Mrs\nThis is a kid from Africa, you, you are a kitchen\nI come quicker than pitches from Sammy Sosa\nYou hoping I'm joking, but first\n\nI'ma eat your pussy 'til you tell me you can't take it\nScreaming \"Stop it,\" don't you fake it, wanna tape it\nGrab my camera, nine months later with a Tyler baby\nBut that won't happen 'til I blow my load\n\nYour pussy tighter than door hinges\nI munch you like sandwiches\nBut not any more cause I'm on tour, so\nLook: FaceTime your clit, I will jack off my dick\nI go hard, shit, I might need an ice pack on my wrist\nFucking, I'm pumping,you know it's coming\nBust in a couple of seconds, I'm sweating, I leave you slump\nIn the back of my truck, butt naked, suck it out of me\nI leave you with nothing, get it?\nThis is what you wanted, this is what you came for\n\nI'ma eat your pussy 'til you tell me you can't take it\nScreaming \"Stop it,\" don't you fake it, wanna tape it\nGrab my

it, wanna tape it\nGrab my camera, nine months later with a Tyler baby\nBut that won't happen 'til I blow my load\n\nYour pussy tighter than door hinges\nI munch you like sandwiches\nBut not any more cause I'm on tour, so\nLook: FaceTime your clit, I will jack off my dick\nI go hard, shit, I might need an ice pack on my wrist\nFucking, I'm pumping,you know it's coming\nBust in a couple of seconds, I'm sweating, I leave you slump\nIn the back of my truck, butt naked, suck it out of me\nI leave you with nothing, get it?\nThis is what you wanted, this is what you came for\n\nI'ma eat your pussy

It's the slave in me\nIt's facts boy I'm back like Rosa Parks least favorite seat\nVideos, stage dives, popups, they watching T'\nWhile y'all niggas watchin' the throne, the throne be watching me\n\nIf you fuck this up\nThere are so many fuckin' kids right now, listenin' to this guy\nGet those wings flapping motherfucker!\nCause this kid's ready to fucking fly\n\nEenie, meenie, miney, mo, nigga nigga on the wall\nRap bars, jail bars, die or shoot a basketball\nTyler, the dark skin, arrested in Austin\nCops know who I was cause their kid said the show was Awesome\n\nTyler, Tyler, I swear to, I swear to fuck! If you fucking...\nDo NOT fuck this up!\nYou have the whole world in your fucking hands\n\nHow many leaders in the house?\nWell can somebody bring the mirrors out? I'm getting lonely\nLikes and apologies and snaps make it obvious\nThat everybody on this fucking planet lackin' confidence\nHow many leaders in the house? (Do not fuck this up!)\nWell can somebody bring the camera out so I can film me\nT a great director nigga's vision must be blurry\nBoy I get them epic shots like jaywalkin' in Missouri\nWait... How many leaders in the house?\nWell can't somebody bring my album out so I can hear one\nPour me a drink, shit I don't know what to think\nCause all these niggas leaning like they Forest Whitaker's blink\nWait... How many leaders in the house?\nSee why nobody got they hands up, see that's the issue"}}, {"title": "Burger", "album": "Goblin", "year": "2011-05-10", "lyrics": "Uh, Jesus, heheh\n\nNigga this is my cup\nDrink the cyanide up\nDope as fuck\nSo I would really shoot a group of guys up\nDeep thought I'm often lost in (Fuck it)\nPut me next to awesome\nStill can't tell the difference\nJust like Asians with their eyes shut\nButt fuck a couple Rots\nIn the Wendy's parking lot\nBarking at the sight of light from my bright sparkling\nCock-a-doodle\nEatin' toaster strudel\nAt a nude beach in Rome\nIn a black Bape spaghetti strap made of Ramen noodles\nMy bitch is bad\nMixed with a thicky ass\nGet my dick Iraqi\nThis will end up in a sticky blast\nChrissy Brown, mask on my face, now I'm kicking ass\nLife's a bitch, fuck college, mommy, I am ditching class\nI rather be happy than fucking forty\nSo fuck the teacher's lecture I'm having Sydney record me\nFor the 2Dope\u2013 (They didn't like it)\nOh well\nLet's get XXL to write us a fucking story\n\nIt's sitting right in my lap, I see it\nScribbled across the lines, I read it\nI'm the fucking poet who knows it\nYou know it, you bogus\nComprehend the language\nYou scared of war?

Is he extremely ridiculous? Yes. Is he extremely talented? Definitely. We are about to embark on an adventure through the making of the album: Cherry Bomb. Take a seat, and relax\n\nYo, what up, it's Tyler, and I'm about to show y'all what really went down when I was recording the album: Cherry Bomb! The album!\nI had a show New Year's 2015, and I haven't came out with music in a while\n\nDamn, finally, you gonna drop a new album\n\nThat show fuckin' sucked dick! That show was trash. What none of these kids knew was that I was halfway done with a brand new album\n*Tyler recording verse from Death Camp*\nDEATH CAMP\n\nI'm recording songs, directing these videos, doing these photoshoots, the release date is comin'\n\nWe look like Puffy and Mase on our jiggy shit, you feel me?\n\nAnd right before it releases, this bullshit happens\nTyler here, and I'm makin' this video, just to prove the fact that I don't wanna get sued for sampling on my song *DEATHCAMP* that appeared on Cherry Bomb\nNow, I rarely sample. I usually play the instruments or get someone to play it if I can't. And the one time I sample for this album, it gets rejected, right before I have to turn the album in. I got Coachella, I got a tour comin' up, I don't really have time. But, fuck it, I gotta figure it out\n*_____ adding his vocals to Death Camp*\n*Tyler recording clapping*\n*_____ playing a guitar riff*\n*Tyler playing and recording the tambourine*\n*Tyler recording his verse on Death Camp*\n*Live performance of Death Camp at Camp Flog Gnaw*\nBUFFALO\n\nThere's obviously an incredible intelligence and shit that I have no opinion on, but he's the dude to make that statement if he backs it up with intelligent thought. The problem is, America doesn't have the intelligent conversation that, they read a headline, but that's actually the problem. So half of me goes, fuck, this ain't my thing, but if this dude's gonna push a button that causes important dialogue, then fuckin' A dude, you know what I mean, 'cause I'm not proud of our whole shit, it's like, you know what I mean?\n\nI usually just make shit 'cause it look cool, but people's brains misinterpret it whatever way they want it to, man...\n*Offstage filming of _____*\n\nI should be that white face character I was in Tamale, because it's like no deeper underlying shit\n\nYou're just making art and then it's interpreted after. \n*At a live performance*\n\nI performed this shit in my bedroom, so this shit's personal when I'm just in my room dancin' alone. Play that shit, Travis?\nMe and my friends hang out at my house a lot, whether we're skateboarding or swimming or playin' a game or someone cooking some food that is really really trash\nI'm just really hungry, this shit is garbage\n*Live performance of _____*\n\nI recorded Cherry Bomb in random houses because I like the windows and looking outside and stuff, and I think why the album has such a bright tone to it\n\nYo, \n\nYou got cum in your ear. *Laughs*\nAlright, back to my house, 'cause that's my, that's my comfort zone\nPILOT\n*Tyler records his verse on Pilot in his room*\n\nI'm about to put this banana in my fuckin' ass! That shit is amazing! Wow! And I'm only on thirty-three percent, that charger is fufu. I've been gone for three hours. Damn, that shit sounds amazing. Alright, can I hear it from the top?\n*Kali Uchis recording her verse on ____*\nTYLER AND ROCKY TOUR TEXAS\n\nListen, yesterday, me and \n\nWhat? You gonna come clean, what, 'cause I whooped your ass?\n\nYou wasn't even playing, nigga! Get the fuck out of here, nigga! You wasn't even there, nigga! Ay bro, I'mma come clean, \n\n Where the fuck you at?!\n\n Everybody know when you play Mario go-karts, you don't play one race\nComing on this tour, I didn't know what to expect\n\nIt's crazy, it kinda, I think it kinda makes me not judge as much\n\nSee, this is really us together, like, we chose to do this, this not no higher powers, like, I know what this nigga does, no-one, comin' around, giving this nigga ideas, he gets with his niggas and he really do what I do, and be like 'yo, we need to, ah man, I need to, we need to do this, do this, do that', that's real creative shit\n\nAnd, when you're really not afraid to be yourself, you're comfortable, it's like a web or a umbrella. When you're not afraid to be you, you're comfortable, when you're comfortable with yourself, you don't have that much hate in your heart, you're not that quick to judge, and when you're not that quick to judge, you're open to more things, and when you're open to more things, you're not ignorant, and when you're not ignorant, racism doesn't exist\n*Mocking Rocky* Yo, what up, I'm ASAP Rocky, you gettin' jiggy here with my mans, uh, I love bad bitches, that's my fuckin' problem\n\nThis nigga Tyler though, almost killed me and Niko, on Washington Boulevard, the day before the carnival last year, just because this nigga was listening to some fuckass, turnt up Death Grips shit, bro\n\nYeah, I wrote RUN at like, nine in the morning. I wake up really early all the time, and I had logged in on Twitter just to, and I saw someone tweet 'bout to roll up'... Dude, that's all you do? And that's how that first line came, 'cause I thought to myself, 'all y'all niggas smokin' y'all brains out'. That song is really about a lot of the gang violence circle:\nAll y'all niggas smoking y'all brains out\nIn the car called life take the lame route\nGoing nowhere fast but you think that you not\nCause you never hesitate to take the thang out\nIn the drop top, pop the trunk then pop pop\nAt his drop top, took another lame out\nOh you the big nigga? Took a hit nigga?\nWell I hope you understand you ain't shit nigga\nCause them niggas whole purpose is to get niggas\nAnd make sure that your mama cry the pain out\nNow that gang is out to get you\nBut you stuck in the same house\nNigga never came out, wow\nIt's a shame how you got sucked in that life\nBut hey man at least you got a name now\nThey say you a \"real nigga\" cause you kill niggas\nNuts for that ice and that cream banana peel niggas\nBanana clips spill, niggas wanna bang out\nFor they approval boy, you can't even hang out\nThat light you hit, it was the light I held\nThat's why you never ever see me with my chains out\nI don't need to, truth they don't feed you\nLies what they got on their plate, they gon eat you\nThey got a homie called Karma he gon meet you\nBetter look the other way if he ever see you\nAnd run as fast as you can, nigga\nPlus, that's in my top three songs to perform\n*Live performance of RUN in Paris, France *\nYou gotta uh, you gotta follow direction. Watch my hand, okay? No nigga, don't put your hands up, just watch (Watch it!) my hand. I'll do this, and then I'll do this. Let's try this\n(Clap!)\n(Wait, stop.)\n(Clap!)\n(Stop!)\n(Clap!)\n(One, two, one two three!)\n******** LYRICS TO RUN AGAIN********* ADD THEM HERE\nCALABASAS, CALIFORNIA 8PM MONDAY NIGHT\n\nGot big arms\n\nWhat's up with you? *Laughs* You good? Aight?\n\nYo, chill bro!\n**MORE LIVE STUFF*\n\nSo Chaz, from Toro, one of my favorite artists ever,  this melody that I had in my head forever, just in my head, I'm runnin', I'm runnin', I'm runnin', I'm runnin', I'm runnin', I'm runnin', some weird opera stuff, but I didn't want it to be too extra'd out. I easily coulda hired a lady who sings opera or got one of the female singers who hits runs and coulda, I'm runnin' I'm runnin', just to emulate a string, but, I know Toro would do it perfect, and he does high pitch, like, he can do high, he can do low, he has such a middle that's really good too, so I just stacked all of 'em and... It came out perfect\nThose chords are gorgeous. I can't . The day that I met Tony-\nYo, yo yo yo yo! Back to RUN!\nI set up, like, all my recording stuff and my instruments in my living room downstairs\nThat ain't even your regular voice?\n\nRunnin', I'm runnin', I'm runnin-\n\nLook, it  be high-pitched, 'cause this is, remember the original is fast as fuck and pitched high. So, but I just couldn't record it at that speed, but that shit is- *plays instrumental* I couldn't record it that fast. And, it's going to be higher pitched, but right now, its- *plays instrumental*\n\nRunnin', I'm runnin', I'm runnin', I'm runnin', I'm runnin', I'm runnin', I'm runnin'\n\nFollow the keyboard\n\nRunni- might have to overdub it\n\nWhat you mean?\n\nIt's such a weird jump. It's like, jumpin' octaves, it's kinda weird\n*re-records his line on RUN*\n\nUh, that last note right here, try to hold that\n\nHold it. Okay\n\nMan, black people are gonna hate this song\n\nI don't see y'all niggas bein' challenged to jump over a fucking car, jump over a trash can with both feet!  Where your knees at, nigga? Where your knees at? Oh, okay!\n\nHe clipped that shit!\n\nTrash! Ay, go up, go up! Trunk now! Go up, trunk!\n\nWhat, he's not gonna do it, did I not do it? Did I do it? I Already did it. I have nothing else to prove\n\nThe trunk! It's taller! Do the trunk, it's taller! Do the trunk, it's taller! See, look at him. There's always an excuse\n\nWhat the fuck!\n\nWhen I made, so, Two Seater was made at the end of 2013, in my room, in like, twenty minutes, out of boredom again. I had just got my house, I was in my room, no furniture, no nothin'. And, this is cool, like, one minute and thirty second song, but I'm like, I wanna take it somewhere. I literally had wrote that string section, played it, and was like, okay, add all these instruments, I'mma get real players to play this, and then, hearing it come to life was so sick!\nHOLLYWOOD HILLS 5PM 2015\n\nSo, that's like the main part. I'mma use it throughout the song, but that's like the important part. Um 'cause (it's) eight bars, for the first four bars, you could get, like, riff it, get crazy, but like, when I start saying two seater and shit, like that part, you could get like soulful, repetitive, just so it doesn't get, uh, it doesn't get lost in jumble with my vocals\n*_____ begins playing the sax*\n\nThat sounds amazing. Just do like, another pass where you just fuckin' let it all out, just do what this tells you\n*_____ begins playing the sax*\n\nAlright, alright, alright, you get it, you get it. So it's 8 PM, I'm about to record at Hans Zimmer studio, I'm a little nervous 'cause this is my first time with a actual string section, but, I know it's gonna be tight as fuck. Trust me, a lot of thought was put into this\n\nDoubling things, and tripling-\n\nThese pads, they-\nSo that should actually be A -\nWell, if we're doubling lots of-\n\nBut I'mma just pan this one-\n\nComing in with a swell is nice-\n\nIt might be easier to have-\n\nYeah, or, no, it should be, it should be on three. Dun dun dun dun dun-\nBut dog, when you get that finished product? It's all worth it\n*____ begin playing strings*\n\nI'm like, what is that? I think I could go higher!\n\nOh, shit! Why'd you do that?!\n\nI'm starting over. I'm starting over! That was so \nSAME NIGHT 30 MINS LATER WANDERING THE STUDIO\n\nHey! How are you!\n\nI'm fine man, how are you?\nThis is Hans Zimmer. If you're not familiar with his work, he scored a bunch of movies like Spiderman and Despicable Me, and... Oh yeah, Inception, and a bunch of other crazy shit, 'cause he's really talented and the list just goes on and on and on. And I got to see his secret little stuff in his secret little room\nLike, you can't make the same sound\n\nNo, exactly, and that's what I love, is it's totally unpredictable\n\nIs this the one where you just plug in shit?\n\nYes\n\nOh my god\n\nAnd there's a whole back wall. I \n\nBut more importantly, I got the nod of approval. So sick!\nHigh five! High five! Then you ain't shit, hoe\nOkay, okay, I'm fully not feeling this\nBlack diamonds, yellow canary diamonds, white diamonds...\nBROWN STAINS\n*Tyler records his verse on Brown Stains*\n\nI think ScHoolboy Q is a actual shermhead, and no-one can tell me any different. He's my fucking favorite ever, I love him so much. He's a shermhead\nI produced a song off his first album, I mean, we've been homies ever since, he's one of the only few rappers I fuck with, and I had made this beat, it sounded like, schizophrenic shermhead, whatever you wanna call it, automatically thought that the tone of voice ScHoolboy Q has would just sound ridiculous over it. I hit him up, he came at night, knocked his shit out in an hour. Bam\nTYLER AND SCHOOLBOY Q RECORDING SESSION HOLLYWOOD CA 2015\n*ScHoolboy Q records his verse on Brown Stains*\n\nWe gotta do it again. Let me \n\nWhat are you doin'?\n\nJust goin' in, man, you know, gon' body some shit cuz\n\nWhat kinda draws are you wearing?\n\nUm...\n\nDude, that's weird\n\nSome Calvin Kleins-\n\nNo! No!\n*Live performance of Brown Stains*\n\n\nIt was dope as fuck. Shout out to Tyler, we got the same car, it's tight\n\nWhen I'm not making a song I can drive fast to or wild out on stage, I'm tryna figure out the right chords and melodies\nSINGERS\n\n\nI feel like rap has a timestamp on it. You could listen to  by Stevie Wonder any time frame, ever. A five-year-old could listen to it. A eighty-year-old could listen to it. It's less boundaries with singing songs\nKeeping ALL the fuckups too\nMy boy Austin, who's in a band called Slow Hollows, is really sick with guitar. He's playing on three songs on the album, and the things that I've learned from him, just over the years made me more comfortable, with who I am, and the things that I like, and just learning more stuff, and what keeps things fresh is just, new energy, and, not getting complacent and stuck. Working with these three girls was just amazing, they knew exactly what I wanted, and then in unison, they just sounded together, and they were open, and they- they made me feel comfortable\nKALI & TYLER RECORDING SESSION HOLLYWOOD TUESDAY 11 PM\n\n\nOh, my name's Kali Uchis, usually he already has something ready and he'll already have an idea, most of the time he writes everything, or he'll have a melody idea. Obviously he produces everything, so he really hones in on making sure everything is exactly how he wants it to be. 'Cause, when I met him, I had just started singing, I feel like I was still really learning about my voice. He definitely made me a lot more comfortable and experiment more with my range. I think what I admire most about Tyler, how dedicated he is, how much he really wants to make something meaningful that's gonna be lasting, rather than make something that, you know, will get to radio, or, will be, something that people listen to right now, and then maybe goes away later, I don't think he's ever really cared about trends, or, um, he just kind of follows what he wants to do, and, um, he works really hard\n(TYLER RECITES VERSE FROM PILOT???)\n(KALI DOES LINE FROM OKAGA???)\n\nOKAGA, CA is my favorite song on that album, and probably, to me personally, in my top five songs in my discography\nI remember hearing Clem a long time ago, and her voice stood out to me so much. It was so high pitched, and like, it almost had this kid-like vibe to it, to where it was just fun, and she was just like- it had no worries in it\n*CLEM RECORDS HER LINE*\n\nPretend, you're  Michael Jackson leads, so you you're own backup singers\n*CLEM RECORDS*\n\nYou know, she comes from this rock background, so to have her singing in a soul cadence, was really interesting to me. It's not many people who know how to hit those registers and riffs that I love. Me and Frank talk about it all the time, it's few people like  is one that we always bring up, Jasmine Sullivan, um, Alice Smith, I which- uh, she's on the OKAGA, CA song on the album, too\n*ALICE SINGS*\n\nI'm Syd, I've known Tyler since I think 2008, so that would be 8 years. The biggest thing that I've learned from working with Tyler is to trust your ideas. I don't agree with all of his ideas, but when somebody, like, trusts themselves that much, makes you question yourself if you don't like it, and that's what I really got from him\n*SYD SINGS*\n\nBut working with Charlie Wilson, that was a whole 'nother story\nFUCKING YOUNG\n\nI don't think I've ever been this stressed making a song. Charlie Wilson took what I had in my head and made it come to fruition so perfectly, that I started stressing out on the fact that I could never do anything that good\n*CHARLIE RECORDS*\n\nWhat the fuck, I hate this. *Laughs* I fully, I fully can't take this\nHe's a legend, and him taking cues from we was so weird\n\n***UM I NEED TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO DO THE SUBTITLING FOR THIS PART***\nFUCKING YOUNG VIDEO SHOOT\n\nI'm so sorry! I'm so sorry\nThis is happening! Oh, my god\nIt was a two week span where everything I had planned for this album just started to come together. It was beautiful\nSMUCKERS\n*KANYE RECORDING VERSE*\nKANYE WEST RECORDING SESSION HIDDEN HILLS 9PM\n\nI gotta figure that shit out!\n\nI see you tryna figure it out!\nHey, \nTen years down the line, niggas gonna be like, SMUCKERS is legendary. That one's for the books, for sure. Yeah, finally just  working with those two dudes was just crazy! I remember playing it for Travis and Lionel, and we was like 'oh, shit', like, I really got these two niggas on a song\nFuckin' fire!\nAnd I knew specifically, I wanted Wayne's tone of voice on there\n\nI kinda- He texted me, just like, 'Man, I got this joint'. He's like a, perfectionist, so he's one of those guys that you know, you, he want, he know exactly what he want from you. Might fuck around and write your verse for you\n\nSo, I told him I wanted him over, and he was like, 'alright, cool'. I sent him my parts with his parts out, and then he just laid his shit down, and it was great by then. Went to 'Ye house, played it for him, he was like, 'cool'. Wayne sent me his shit the day after I played it, I went back the day after Wayne sent it and played it for 'Ye again, and he heard me and Wayne verse, and he was like *shakes his head* ripped his paper out of his notebook, balled it up, and started a new, and it was ideas on there, and he was like, 'Y'all niggas really 'bout to make me rap and go in, like, I ain't had niggas makin' me want to do that in so long'\n\nFirst of all, Tyler changed the game. Maybe I probably had online, and I knew- I wouldn't say because people might think  it was too gross to put in a rap, or it didn't go with the whole vibe", "image":

Is he extremely ridiculous? Yes. Is he extremely talented? Definitely. We are about to embark on an adventure through the making of the album: Cherry Bomb. Take a seat, and relax\n\nYo, what up, it's Tyler, and I'm about to show y'all what really went down when I was recording the album: Cherry Bomb! The album!\nI had a show New Year's 2015, and I haven't came out with music in a while\n\nDamn, finally, you gonna drop a new album\n\nThat show fuckin' sucked dick! That show was trash. What none of these kids knew was that I was halfway done with a brand new album\n*Tyler recording verse from Death Camp*\nDEATH CAMP\n\nI'm recording songs, directing these videos, doing these photoshoots, the release date is comin'\n\nWe look like Puffy and Mase on our jiggy shit, you feel me?\n\nAnd right before it releases, this bullshit happens\nTyler here, and I'm makin' this video, just to prove the fact that I don't wanna get sued for sampling on my song *DEATHCAMP* that appeared on Cherry Bomb\nNow, I rarely sample. I usually play the instruments or get someone to play it if I can't. And the one time I sample for this album, it gets rejected, right before I have to turn the album in. I got Coachella, I got a tour comin' up, I don't really have time. But, fuck it, I gotta figure it out\n*_____ adding his vocals to Death Camp*\n*Tyler recording clapping*\n*_____ playing a guitar riff*\n*Tyler playing and recording the tambourine*\n*Tyler recording his verse on Death Camp*\n*Live performance of Death Camp at Camp Flog Gnaw*\nBUFFALO\n\nThere's obviously an incredible intelligence and shit that I have no opinion on, but he's the dude to make that statement if he backs it up with intelligent thought. The problem is, America doesn't have the intelligent conversation that, they read a headline, but that's actually the problem. So half of me goes, fuck, this ain't my thing, but if this dude's gonna push a button that causes important dialogue, then fuckin' A dude, you know what I mean, 'cause I'm not proud of our whole shit, it's like, you know what I mean?\n\nI usually just make shit 'cause it look cool, but people's brains misinterpret it whatever way they want it to, man...\n*Offstage filming of _____*\n\nI should be that white face character I was in Tamale, because it's like no deeper underlying shit\n\nYou're just making art and then it's interpreted after. \n*At a live performance*\n\nI performed this shit in my bedroom, so this shit's personal when I'm just in my room dancin' alone. Play that shit, Travis?\nMe and my friends hang out at my house a lot, whether we're skateboarding or swimming or playin' a game or someone cooking some food that is really really trash\nI'm just really hungry, this shit is garbage\n*Live performance of _____*\n\nI recorded Cherry Bomb in random houses because I like the windows and looking outside and stuff, and I think why the album has such a bright tone to it\n\nYo, \n\nYou got cum in your ear. *Laughs*\nAlright, back to my house, 'cause that's my, that's my comfort zone\nPILOT\n*Tyler records his verse on Pilot in his room*\n\nI'm about to put this banana in my fuckin' ass! That shit is amazing! Wow! And I'm only on thirty-three percent, that charger is fufu. I've been gone for three hours. Damn, that shit sounds amazing. Alright, can I hear it from the top?\n*Kali Uchis recording her verse on ____*\nTYLER AND ROCKY TOUR TEXAS\n\nListen, yesterday, me and \n\nWhat? You gonna come clean, what, 'cause I whooped your ass?\n\nYou wasn't even playing, nigga! Get the fuck out of here, nigga! You wasn't even there, nigga! Ay bro, I'mma come clean, \n\n Where the fuck you at?!\n\n Everybody know when you play Mario go-karts, you don't play one race\nComing on this tour, I didn't know what to expect\n\nIt's crazy, it kinda, I think it kinda makes me not judge as much\n\nSee, this is really us together, like, we chose to do this, this not no higher powers, like, I know what this nigga does, no-one, comin' around, giving this nigga ideas, he gets with his niggas and he really do what I do, and be like 'yo, we need to, ah man, I need to, we need to do this, do this, do that', that's real creative shit\n\nAnd, when you're really not afraid to be yourself, you're comfortable, it's like a web or a umbrella. When you're not afraid to be you, you're comfortable, when you're comfortable with yourself, you don't have that much hate in your heart, you're not that quick to judge, and when you're not that quick to judge, you're open to more things, and when you're open to more things, you're not ignorant, and when you're not ignorant, racism doesn't exist\n*Mocking Rocky* Yo, what up, I'm ASAP Rocky, you gettin' jiggy here with my mans, uh, I love bad bitches, that's my fuckin' problem\n\nThis nigga Tyler though, almost killed me and Niko, on Washington Boulevard, the day before the carnival last year, just because this nigga was listening to some fuckass, turnt up Death Grips shit, bro\n\nYeah, I wrote RUN at like, nine in the morning. I wake up really early all the time, and I had logged in on Twitter just to, and I saw someone tweet 'bout to roll up'... Dude, that's all you do? And that's how that first line came, 'cause I thought to myself, 'all y'all niggas smokin' y'all brains out'. That song is really about a lot of the gang violence circle:\nAll y'all niggas smoking y'all brains out\nIn the car called life take the lame route\nGoing nowhere fast but you think that you not\nCause you never hesitate to take the thang out\nIn the drop top, pop the trunk then pop pop\nAt his drop top, took another lame out\nOh you the big nigga? Took a hit nigga?\nWell I hope you understand you ain't shit nigga\nCause them niggas whole purpose is to get niggas\nAnd make sure that your mama cry the pain out\nNow that gang is out to get you\nBut you stuck in the same house\nNigga never came out, wow\nIt's a shame how you got sucked in that life\nBut hey man at least you got a name now\nThey say you a \"real nigga\" cause you kill niggas\nNuts for that ice and that cream banana peel niggas\nBanana clips spill, niggas wanna bang out\nFor they approval boy, you can't even hang out\nThat light you hit, it was the light I held\nThat's why you never ever see me with my chains out\nI don't need to, truth they don't feed you\nLies what they got on their plate, they gon eat you\nThey got a homie called Karma he gon meet you\nBetter look the other way if he ever see you\nAnd run as fast as you can, nigga\nPlus, that's in my top three songs to perform\n*Live performance of RUN in Paris, France *\nYou gotta uh, you gotta follow direction. Watch my hand, okay? No nigga, don't put your hands up, just watch (Watch it!) my hand. I'll do this, and then I'll do this. Let's try this\n(Clap!)\n(Wait, stop.)\n(Clap!)\n(Stop!)\n(Clap!)\n(One, two, one two three!)\n******** LYRICS TO RUN AGAIN********* ADD THEM HERE\nCALABASAS, CALIFORNIA 8PM MONDAY NIGHT\n\nGot big arms\n\nWhat's up with you? *Laughs* You good? Aight?\n\nYo, chill bro!\n**MORE LIVE STUFF*\n\nSo Chaz, from Toro, one of my favorite artists ever,  this melody that I had in my head forever, just in my head, I'm runnin', I'm runnin', I'm runnin', I'm runnin', I'm runnin', I'm runnin', some weird opera stuff, but I didn't want it to be too extra'd out. I easily coulda hired a lady who sings opera or got one of the female singers who hits runs and coulda, I'm runnin' I'm runnin', just to emulate a string, but, I know Toro would do it perfect, and he does high pitch, like, he can do high, he can do low, he has such a middle that's really good too, so I just stacked all of 'em and... It came out perfect\nThose chords are gorgeous. I can't . The day that I met Tony-\nYo, yo yo yo yo! Back to RUN!\nI set up, like, all my recording stuff and my instruments in my living room downstairs\nThat ain't even your regular voice?\n\nRunnin', I'm runnin', I'm runnin-\n\nLook, it  be high-pitched, 'cause this is, remember the original is fast as fuck and pitched high. So, but I just couldn't record it at that speed, but that shit is- *plays instrumental* I couldn't record it that fast. And, it's going to be higher pitched, but right now, its- *plays instrumental*\n\nRunnin', I'm runnin', I'm runnin', I'm runnin', I'm runnin', I'm runnin', I'm runnin'\n\nFollow the keyboard\n\nRunni- might have to overdub it\n\nWhat you mean?\n\nIt's such a weird jump. It's like, jumpin' octaves, it's kinda weird\n*re-records his line on RUN*\n\nUh, that last note right here, try to hold that\n\nHold it. Okay\n\nMan, black people are gonna hate this song\n\nI don't see y'all niggas bein' challenged to jump over a fucking car, jump over a trash can with both feet!  Where your knees at, nigga? Where your knees at? Oh, okay!\n\nHe clipped that shit!\n\nTrash! Ay, go up, go up! Trunk now! Go up, trunk!\n\nWhat, he's not gonna do it, did I not do it? Did I do it? I Already did it. I have nothing else to prove\n\nThe trunk! It's taller! Do the trunk, it's taller! Do the trunk, it's taller! See, look at him. There's always an excuse\n\nWhat the fuck!\n\nWhen I made, so, Two Seater was made at the end of 2013, in my room, in like, twenty minutes, out of boredom again. I had just got my house, I was in my room, no furniture, no nothin'. And, this is cool, like, one minute and thirty second song, but I'm like, I wanna take it somewhere. I literally had wrote that string section, played it, and was like, okay, add all these instruments, I'mma get real players to play this, and then, hearing it come to life was so sick!\nHOLLYWOOD HILLS 5PM 2015\n\nSo, that's like the main part. I'mma use it throughout the song, but that's like the important part. Um 'cause (it's) eight bars, for the first four bars, you could get, like, riff it, get crazy, but like, when I start saying two seater and shit, like that part, you could get like soulful, repetitive, just so it doesn't get, uh, it doesn't get lost in jumble with my vocals\n*_____ begins playing the sax*\n\nThat sounds amazing. Just do like, another pass where you just fuckin' let it all out, just do what this tells you\n*_____ begins playing the sax*\n\nAlright, alright, alright, you get it, you get it. So it's 8 PM, I'm about to record at Hans Zimmer studio, I'm a little nervous 'cause this is my first time with a actual string section, but, I know it's gonna be tight as fuck. Trust me, a lot of thought was put into this\n\nDoubling things, and tripling-\n\nThese pads, they-\nSo that should actually be A -\nWell, if we're doubling lots of-\n\nBut I'mma just pan this one-\n\nComing in with a swell is nice-\n\nIt might be easier to have-\n\nYeah, or, no, it should be, it should be on three. Dun dun dun dun dun-\nBut dog, when you get that finished product? It's all worth it\n*____ begin playing strings*\n\nI'm like, what is that? I think I could go higher!\n\nOh, shit! Why'd you do that?!\n\nI'm starting over. I'm starting over! That was so \nSAME NIGHT 30 MINS LATER WANDERING THE STUDIO\n\nHey! How are you!\n\nI'm fine man, how are you?\nThis is Hans Zimmer. If you're not familiar with his work, he scored a bunch of movies like Spiderman and Despicable Me, and... Oh yeah, Inception, and a bunch of other crazy shit, 'cause he's really talented and the list just goes on and on and on. And I got to see his secret little stuff in his secret little room\nLike, you can't make the same sound\n\nNo, exactly, and that's what I love, is it's totally unpredictable\n\nIs this the one where you just plug in shit?\n\nYes\n\nOh my god\n\nAnd there's a whole back wall. I \n\nBut more importantly, I got the nod of approval. So sick!\nHigh five! High five! Then you ain't shit, hoe\nOkay, okay, I'm fully not feeling this\nBlack diamonds, yellow canary diamonds, white diamonds...\nBROWN STAINS\n*Tyler records his verse on Brown Stains*\n\nI think ScHoolboy Q is a actual shermhead, and no-one can tell me any different. He's my fucking favorite ever, I love him so much. He's a shermhead\nI produced a song off his first album, I mean, we've been homies ever since, he's one of the only few rappers I fuck with, and I had made this beat, it sounded like, schizophrenic shermhead, whatever you wanna call it, automatically thought that the tone of voice ScHoolboy Q has would just sound ridiculous over it. I hit him up, he came at night, knocked his shit out in an hour. Bam\nTYLER AND SCHOOLBOY Q RECORDING SESSION HOLLYWOOD CA 2015\n*ScHoolboy Q records his verse on Brown Stains*\n\nWe gotta do it again. Let me \n\nWhat are you doin'?\n\nJust goin' in, man, you know, gon' body some shit cuz\n\nWhat kinda draws are you wearing?\n\nUm...\n\nDude, that's weird\n\nSome Calvin Kleins-\n\nNo! No!\n*Live performance of Brown Stains*\n\n\nIt was dope as fuck. Shout out to Tyler, we got the same car, it's tight\n\nWhen I'm not making a song I can drive fast to or wild out on stage, I'm tryna figure out the right chords and melodies\nSINGERS\n\n\nI feel like rap has a timestamp on it. You could listen to  by Stevie Wonder any time frame, ever. A five-year-old could listen to it. A eighty-year-old could listen to it. It's less boundaries with singing songs\nKeeping ALL the fuckups too\nMy boy Austin, who's in a band called Slow Hollows, is really sick with guitar. He's playing on three songs on the album, and the things that I've learned from him, just over the years made me more comfortable, with who I am, and the things that I like, and just learning more stuff, and what keeps things fresh is just, new energy, and, not getting complacent and stuck. Working with these three girls was just amazing, they knew exactly what I wanted, and then in unison, they just sounded together, and they were open, and they- they made me feel comfortable\nKALI & TYLER RECORDING SESSION HOLLYWOOD TUESDAY 11 PM\n\n\nOh, my name's Kali Uchis, usually he already has something ready and he'll already have an idea, most of the time he writes everything, or he'll have a melody idea. Obviously he produces everything, so he really hones in on making sure everything is exactly how he wants it to be. 'Cause, when I met him, I had just started singing, I feel like I was still really learning about my voice. He definitely made me a lot more comfortable and experiment more with my range. I think what I admire most about Tyler, how dedicated he is, how much he really wants to make something meaningful that's gonna be lasting, rather than make something that, you know, will get to radio, or, will be, something that people listen to right now, and then maybe goes away later, I don't think he's ever really cared about trends, or, um, he just kind of follows what he wants to do, and, um, he works really hard\n(TYLER RECITES VERSE FROM PILOT???)\n(KALI DOES LINE FROM OKAGA???)\n\nOKAGA, CA is my favorite song on that album, and probably, to me personally, in my top five songs in my discography\nI remember hearing Clem a long time ago, and her voice stood out to me so much. It was so high pitched, and like, it almost had this kid-like vibe to it, to where it was just fun, and she was just like- it had no worries in it\n*CLEM RECORDS HER LINE*\n\nPretend, you're  Michael Jackson leads, so you you're own backup singers\n*CLEM RECORDS*\n\nYou know, she comes from this rock background, so to have her singing in a soul cadence, was really interesting to me. It's not many people who know how to hit those registers and riffs that I love. Me and Frank talk about it all the time, it's few people like  is one that we always bring up, Jasmine Sullivan, um, Alice Smith, I which- uh, she's on the OKAGA, CA song on the album, too\n*ALICE SINGS*\n\nI'm Syd, I've known Tyler since I think 2008, so that would be 8 years. The biggest thing that I've learned from working with Tyler is to trust your ideas. I don't agree with all of his ideas, but when somebody, like, trusts themselves that much, makes you question yourself if you don't like it, and that's what I really got from him\n*SYD SINGS*\n\nBut working with Charlie Wilson, that was a whole 'nother story\nFUCKING YOUNG\n\nI don't think I've ever been this stressed making a song. Charlie Wilson took what I had in my head and made it come to fruition so perfectly, that I started stressing out on the fact that I could never do anything that good\n*CHARLIE RECORDS*\n\nWhat the fuck, I hate this. *Laughs* I fully, I fully can't take this\nHe's a legend, and him taking cues from we was so weird\n\n***UM I NEED TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO DO THE SUBTITLING FOR THIS PART***\nFUCKING YOUNG VIDEO SHOOT\n\nI'm so sorry! I'm so sorry\nThis is happening! Oh, my god\nIt was a two week span where everything I had planned for this album just started to come together. It was beautiful\nSMUCKERS\n*KANYE RECORDING VERSE*\nKANYE WEST RECORDING SESSION HIDDEN HILLS 9PM\n\nI gotta figure that shit out!\n\nI see you tryna figure it out!\nHey, \nTen years down the line, niggas gonna be like, SMUCKERS is legendary. That one's for the books, for sure. Yeah, finally just  working with those two dudes was just crazy! I remember playing it for Travis and Lionel, and we was like 'oh, shit', like, I really got these two niggas on a song\nFuckin' fire!\nAnd I knew specifically, I wanted Wayne's tone of voice on there\n\nI kinda- He texted me, just like, 'Man, I got this joint'. He's like a, perfectionist, so he's one of those guys that you know, you, he want, he know exactly what he want from you. Might fuck around and write your verse for you\n\nSo, I told him I wanted him over, and he was like, 'alright, cool'. I sent him my parts with his parts out, and then he just laid his shit down, and it was great by then. Went to 'Ye house, played it for him, he was like, 'cool'. Wayne sent me his shit the day after I played it, I went back the day after Wayne sent it and played it for 'Ye again, and he heard me and Wayne verse, and he was like *shakes his head* ripped his paper out of his notebook, balled it up, and started a new, and it was ideas on there, and he was like, 'Y'all niggas really 'bout to make me rap and go in, like, I ain't had niggas makin' me want to do that in so long'\n\nFirst of all, Tyler changed the game. Maybe I probably had online, and I knew- I wouldn't say because people might think  it was too gross to put in a rap, or it didn't go with the whole vibe"}}, {"title": "Colossus", "album": "Wolf", "year": "2013-04-01", "lyrics": "Went to Six Flags, six fags came up\nAnd said \"Ayo! Can we get a pic?\" I said no\nAnd they said \"Oh! It's Wolf Gang, \"Yonkers\", Goblin is my shit though\"\nNow I'm like, fuck, I don't want to be an asshole\nSo I'm sitting there posing with Travis, Devon\nWith a fake smile like her titties was drawing it on\nSo fucking annoyed cause I missed Goliath\nCause some kid said I was there, then they caused a riot\nNow I'm surrounded by a 25 hound of fuckers tryna get a photo\nAll because they noticed the top with the box logo\nAnd them fucking ears, guarantee they didn't even hear Bastard\nThey bandwagon-jumped me from a pogo\nI'm going fucking loco, \"Hey, Tyler, can I...?\"\nNo, bitch, don't you see me tryna buy a fucking churro?\n\"But Tyler, you're my hero, I used to get bullied\nUntil I heard \"Radicals,\" the last part got to me\nSee, I used to give a fuck until my cock would bleed\nNow I'm the happiest I think I'll ever ever be\nMy life is just like yours, no father\nMy momma must have forgot to stop with a popped condom\nIn school I was the one thinking outside boxes\nSo everybody in them would say that I got problems\nSo when I heard you say it, I said it back like fuck 'em\nYou're an inspiration to niggas like me\nNot the niggas who like you just cause of lyrics and beats\nI'm talking 'bout the niggas who don't know where they're going to be\nI heard the song \"Bastard\" right in the moment of heat\nNot in summer, but of course I was holding a heat\nGun on the edge of my feet, I heard that first piano chord\nAnd it drew me in like predators carrying treats\nThen I said to myself, fuck, is he speaking to me?\nSee, me and you, we go together like snare and a beat\nI mean snare and a kick drum, see my forearm?\nI carved OF on it this morning with a glass shard\nOn my green miniramp that I built in my backyard (That's weird)\nThat's hard, that scar from playing air guitar\nWhen I see you play at the Roxy (Uhh)\nTyler, I love you, I wanna be just like you (Alright)\nI think about your face and I don't even fucking try to (No homo)\nWish I had a basement meant for me to hide you\nWe could play X-Box and listen to \"In Search Of...\" and eat donuts\nOver conversating bout what church does\nCome up with weird-ass videos with roach bugs\nI'm straight edge too, so no drugs on this trip\nAnd Raquel that bitch, you should've killed that bitch\nYou should've took me instead (Uhh, that's weird)\nSee, if you can't have her then he shouldn't neither\nAnd if I can't have you then she shouldn't either\nNo one should see you, but me in your t-shirt\nI worship you until the fucking wrinkles on my knees hurt (What the fuck)\nOdd Future, Wolf Gang, Golf Wang, Flog Gnaw, free Earl mobbing\nI know it seems like just I'm slobbing on your knob\nBut I'm just a fan and I ain't losing my fucking noggin (Yeah, you are)\nI ain't got a job and I went out and bought Goblin about 5 times\nCause (Thanks for the support) I love you man (Alright)\nI like tie-dyed tees or just plain white tees\nI like pants that's cut, I like words like \"fuck\"\nI got your pics on my wall with the mouth cut out\nNow paper cuts on my balls because your dick's in my jaw (What the fuck)\nAnd I hit you on Twitter about 10 minutes a day\nAnd now I'm bitter cause you dont even reply with a hey (Sorry)\nAnd my boys think I'm gay cause I play \"VCR\"\nIn my car all alone speakers waking up neighbors...\"\nAll right, my nigga, calm down, it's getting weird, take this pic\nSo I can get on Colossus, line as slow as molasses\n(Tyler, listen) No, nigga, I see you're loving my shit\nAnd I appreciate the fact that you would suck on my dick\nBut I'm not gay so it's awkward, now I'm grouchy like Oscar\nAfter spilling some shit on his newest pair of beige Dockers\n\"Yonkers\" and \"Yonkers\" (I love that song) Sick of hearing about \"Yonkers\"\nI'm grateful that it worked, I attacked and I conquered\n\"Yeah whatever but I had a fucking blast at that concert\nI was at the Boston one, I got a t-shirt from Sagan\nThe one that say \"Sagan Lockhart\" and when you came out to \"Sandwitches\"\nThat's when my fucking boycrush got started\"\n\nJust take this fucking picture man, shit...", "image":

Can we get a pic?\" I said no\nAnd they said \"Oh! It's Wolf Gang, \"Yonkers\", Goblin is my shit though\"\nNow I'm like, fuck, I don't want to be an asshole\nSo I'm sitting there posing with Travis, Devon\nWith a fake smile like her titties was drawing it on\nSo fucking annoyed cause I missed Goliath\nCause some kid said I was there, then they caused a riot\nNow I'm surrounded by a 25 hound of fuckers tryna get a photo\nAll because they noticed the top with the box logo\nAnd them fucking ears, guarantee they didn't even hear Bastard\nThey bandwagon-jumped me from a pogo\nI'm going fucking loco, \"Hey, Tyler, can I...?\"\nNo, bitch, don't you see me tryna buy a fucking churro?\n\"But Tyler, you're my hero, I used to get bullied\nUntil I heard \"Radicals,\" the last part got to me\nSee, I used to give a fuck until my cock would bleed\nNow I'm the happiest I think I'll ever ever be\nMy life is just like yours, no father\nMy momma must have forgot to stop with a popped condom\nIn school I was the one thinking outside boxes\nSo everybody in them would say that I got problems\nSo when I heard you say it, I said it back like fuck 'em\nYou're an inspiration to niggas like me\nNot the niggas who like you just cause of lyrics and beats\nI'm talking 'bout the niggas who don't know where they're going to be\nI heard the song \"Bastard\" right in the moment of heat\nNot in summer, but of course I was holding a heat\nGun on the edge of my feet, I heard that first piano chord\nAnd it drew me in like predators carrying treats\nThen I said to myself, fuck, is he speaking to me?\nSee, me and you, we go together like snare and a beat\nI mean snare and a kick drum, see my forearm?\nI carved OF on it this morning with a glass shard\nOn my green miniramp that I built in my backyard (That's weird)\nThat's hard, that scar from playing air guitar\nWhen I see you play at the Roxy (Uhh)\nTyler, I love you, I wanna be just like you (Alright)\nI think about your face and I don't even fucking try to (No homo)\nWish I had a basement meant for me to hide you\nWe could play X-Box and listen to \"In Search Of...\" and eat donuts\nOver conversating bout what church does\nCome up with weird-ass videos with roach bugs\nI'm straight edge too, so no drugs on this trip\nAnd Raquel that bitch, you should've killed that bitch\nYou should've took me instead (Uhh, that's weird)\nSee, if you can't have her then he shouldn't neither\nAnd if I can't have you then she shouldn't either\nNo one should see you, but me in your t-shirt\nI worship you until the fucking wrinkles on my knees hurt (What the fuck)\nOdd Future, Wolf Gang, Golf Wang, Flog Gnaw, free Earl mobbing\nI know it seems like just I'm slobbing on your knob\nBut I'm just a fan and I ain't losing my fucking noggin (Yeah, you are)\nI ain't got a job and I went out and bought Goblin about 5 times\nCause (Thanks for the support) I love you man (Alright)\nI like tie-dyed tees or just plain white tees\nI like pants that's cut, I like words like \"fuck\"\nI got your pics on my wall with the mouth cut out\nNow paper cuts on my balls because your dick's in my jaw (What the fuck)\nAnd I hit you on Twitter about 10 minutes a day\nAnd now I'm bitter cause you dont even reply with a hey (Sorry)\nAnd my boys think I'm gay cause I play \"VCR\"\nIn my car all alone speakers waking up neighbors...\"\nAll right, my nigga, calm down, it's getting weird, take this pic\nSo I can get on Colossus, line as slow as molasses\n(Tyler, listen) No, nigga, I see you're loving my shit\nAnd I appreciate the fact that you would suck on my dick\nBut I'm not gay so it's awkward, now I'm grouchy like Oscar\nAfter spilling some shit on his newest pair of beige Dockers\n\"Yonkers\" and \"Yonkers\" (I love that song) Sick of hearing about \"Yonkers\"\nI'm grateful that it worked, I attacked and I conquered\n\"Yeah whatever but I had a fucking blast at that concert\nI was at the Boston one, I got a t-shirt from Sagan\nThe one that say \"Sagan Lockhart\" and when you came out to \"Sandwitches\"\nThat's when my fucking boycrush got started\"\n\nJust take this fucking picture man, shit..."}}, {"title": "Commercial", "album": "The Odd Future Tape", "year":

jack off I'm anorexic\nI'm fucking asthmatic, my records problematic\nTalkin' to myself because my therapist done had it\nAll the racial slurs from the wangsters playin' from Lenny Kravitz\nLove Lockdown like I am some sort of faggot\nBut I'm not in the first place\nWaiting on my dad to say hi on my birthday\nCause Jesus wouldn't even be my friend on Church day\nI plan on getting back *censored* the worst way\nIn the jungle, I planned on the keeper\nInside of the cage cause I'm a motherfuckin' Zebra\nObama's in office, niggas get job like teachers\nLookin' out, retarded kids screamin' out fuck slob, Jesus\n\nAnd I can write a hook fast\nI can get straight to the cash\nY'all niggas come last, I'm first though\nNo rehearsal, I know it all like Urkel\nYou can call it commercial\nSo turn it up, turn it up\nOdd Future won't stop it\n\nI make music for a reason, didn't vote Obama\nSo you can charge me with treason\nYear round asshole, the fuck you season\nThe flu, I'm sick that's why everybody sneezin'\nI'm always cheesin', smile for a reason\nFuck as I fuck you, I'm always teasin'\nMy daughter need milk and a quilt\nSo I'm sellin' the the haze for six bucks cause she always sneezin'\nSome people need drugs, some people need dubs\nOn they car note to go to the club\nBut really, really, really, all I need deep down is a hug\n\n\nLook, I'm back like niggas on a bus\nWith a Rosa Parks state of mind, I don't give a fuck\nAnd I'm strollin' Down South like Good Luck Chuck\nIn a Malcolm X shirt chillin' with the Ku Klux\nKlan, I ain't nothin' to fuck with\nO.F. clan they ain't nothin' to fuck with\nThe O.F. clan they ain't nothin' to fuck with\nThis Black Snake Moan is somethin' to suck bitch"}}, {"title": "Cowboy", "album": "Wolf", "year":

brain cancer ate my Granny up\nRest in peace or lie in it, life ain't got no light in it\nDarker than that closet that nigga Frankie was hiding in\nOpen it, dope in it, Bobby where's my fucking pipe?\nDress my little dick as Ike, twenty says I hit your wife\nThis is life, truthfully I just want to fly some kites\nGrab Salem and Slater and go around, riding bikes\nGet some ice cream, Golf Wang Roscoe's for the night\nTo skate around and do annoying shit that older peeps despise\nNigga fuck it though, going hard as riga mo\nGot a nigga dollars and a couple cracker kids at shows\nCracked a couple kids in the head with this cast\nHad a blast out Europe, had a Swedish bitch licking toes\nThat's how it goes, designing clothes\nCats on everything, cats on everything\nYou think all this money will make a happy me?\nBut I'm 'bout as lonely as crackers that supermodels eat\nEverybody's sparking but me, and I keep coughing\nCan't keep calm in this spot's hot box and I'm getting nauseous\nHop in the car, ride to Saugus, and head straight to the office\nPissed off at Jasper because that's some faggot shit called \"Pink Dolphin\"\nI roll here on a mean unicorn\nGreen hat, Vans, Golf top is the team uniform\nDowning that Capri Sun, tighten my bandana up\nSomething like a lez, I'm forgetting my damn manners cause\n\nI am the cowboy on my own trip\nAnd I am the cowboy on my own trip\nAnd I am the cowboy on my own trip\nAnd I am the cowboy\n\nWhen you're alone thoughts start coming in\nPunching in that dark lock box and they start rummaging\nShit you've got to battle with, wishing they could skedaddle\nBut it makes your shadow say none, fun and grab the gun again\nI needed to get out of the house\nSo I hit the Dead Sams, and we went biking it out\nIn a black hoodie, with an Arizona and a bag of Skittles\nJust to see what all that fucking hype is about\nNow everytime you see a roach you think of me, ay?\nCause everytime I see one I think what his parents would say\nIn court saying I ate him, I wasn't present that day\nI was with Whitney smoking, sitting at the dock of the bay\n\nI am the cowboy on my own trip\nAnd I am the cowboy on my own trip\nAnd I am the cowboy on my own trip\nAnd I am the cowboy\n\nDo you know how weird it is knowing I make a bunch of cheese\nWhile my friends can't afford little pizzas from Little Caesars\nAnd their whole goal is to roll up and smoke bowls\nSo I don't feel bad when they not eating\n(But you still treating us, you punk bitch)\nWolf Haley got more methods than Pinkman\nI'm never civil, fuck Lincoln, 'Preme out the bag it's no wrinkles\nI'm okie dokie and loopy and booboo nana and caca\nIf you think I'm fucking koo-koo, try talking to my shrink then\n\n\"Hey...\"\n\"Bitch.\"\n\"I'm right here.\"\n\"Yo, who's that..?\"\n\"That's Salem, that's my girlfriend. You stay the fuck away from her alright?\"\n\nI am the cowboy on my own trip\nAnd I am the cowboy on my own trip\nAnd I am the cowboy on my own trip\nAnd I am the cowboy", "image":

up\nAin't been this fucking sick since brain cancer ate my Granny up\nRest in peace or lie in it, life ain't got no light in it\nDarker than that closet that nigga Frankie was hiding in\nOpen it, dope in it, Bobby where's my fucking pipe?\nDress my little dick as Ike, twenty says I hit your wife\nThis is life, truthfully I just want to fly some kites\nGrab Salem and Slater and go around, riding bikes\nGet some ice cream, Golf Wang Roscoe's for the night\nTo skate around and do annoying shit that older peeps despise\nNigga fuck it though, going hard as riga mo\nGot a nigga dollars and a couple cracker kids at shows\nCracked a couple kids in the head with this cast\nHad a blast out Europe, had a Swedish bitch licking toes\nThat's how it goes, designing clothes\nCats on everything, cats on everything\nYou think all this money will make a happy me?\nBut I'm 'bout as lonely as crackers that supermodels eat\nEverybody's sparking but me, and I keep coughing\nCan't keep calm in this spot's hot box and I'm getting nauseous\nHop in the car, ride to Saugus, and head straight to the office\nPissed off at Jasper because that's some faggot shit called \"Pink Dolphin\"\nI roll here on a mean unicorn\nGreen hat, Vans, Golf top is the team uniform\nDowning that Capri Sun, tighten my bandana up\nSomething like a lez, I'm forgetting my damn manners cause\n\nI am the cowboy on my own trip\nAnd I am the cowboy on my own trip\nAnd I am the cowboy on my own trip\nAnd I am the cowboy\n\nWhen you're alone thoughts start coming in\nPunching in that dark lock box and they start rummaging\nShit you've got to battle with, wishing they could skedaddle\nBut it makes your shadow say none, fun and grab the gun again\nI needed to get out of the house\nSo I hit the Dead Sams, and we went biking it out\nIn a black hoodie, with an Arizona and a bag of Skittles\nJust to see what all that fucking hype is about\nNow everytime you see a roach you think of me, ay?\nCause everytime I see one I think what his parents would say\nIn court saying I ate him, I wasn't present that day\nI was with Whitney smoking, sitting at the dock of the bay\n\nI am the cowboy on my own trip\nAnd I am the cowboy on my own trip\nAnd I am the cowboy on my own trip\nAnd I am the cowboy\n\nDo you know how weird it is knowing I make a bunch of cheese\nWhile my friends can't afford little pizzas from Little Caesars\nAnd their whole goal is to roll up and smoke bowls\nSo I don't feel bad when they not eating\n(But you still treating us, you punk bitch)\nWolf Haley got more methods than Pinkman\nI'm never civil, fuck Lincoln, 'Preme out the bag it's no wrinkles\nI'm okie dokie and loopy and booboo nana and caca\nIf you think I'm fucking koo-koo, try talking to my shrink then\n\n\"Hey...\"\n\"Bitch.\"\n\"I'm right here.\"\n\"Yo, who's that..?\"\n\"That's Salem, that's my girlfriend. You stay the fuck away from her alright?\"\n\nI am the cowboy on my own trip\nAnd I am the cowboy on my own trip\nAnd I am the cowboy on my own trip\nAnd I am the cowboy"}}, {"title": "Cult Shit", "album": null, "year": null, "lyrics": "I'm recordin' that shit on the fuckin' little mic\nBy the little camera thing on the fuckin' Mac book\nSo this shit is choppy and bad quality, but fuck it\nWolf Gang, Ace Creator\n\nSomebody tell Justin Beiber that I'm fuckin' coming\nAin't no point in runnin', I'm a nigga, just a little quicker\nSo I catch him stretchin', have him guessin' where his cracker throat\nChop his balls off and use his skin to make a baby coat\nAin't he dope? No, he the same as shit that Tyler wrote\nThis is Ace, Wolf is in the back with Travis snortin' coke\nRiley's here, Connie's dead, pickin' pussy pisses pike\nShe won't leave, dick as big as Kelly Price's appetite\nApprehend a couple men, triple six is fuckin' sin\nMake Queen Latifah and Sydney go slap a couple dykes\nWrap around 'til they hit the ground and they hear a sound\nThat doesn't make sense like nigga kids wearing cap and gowns\nThis my album, and when your parents try to come around\nDo the fuckin' exact opposite of turnin' it down\nAnd when they try to get parental and start talkin' loud\nTell them that you're from the Wolf Gang and you're fuckin' proud\nThen start barkin' loud 'til the neighbors wanna calm you down\nBut call the pigs, who'll probably come in bout a half an hour\nTell them that your sorry, you're a cow, took a fuckin' shower\nBut make it in time for shitty re-runs of Rocket Power\nThis is the shit that is makin' me cynical\nThe clinical attempts at schizophrenia's critical\nFuckin' voices follow me, emulatin' like twitter roll\nO.F. is a cult, assume that I'm the fucking general\nSo when I mention suicide, I'm being Mr. Literal\nThe coke inside nine capsules, fuck it let's split a roll\nLife is like a phone booth, these pigeons is the fuckin' toll\n1-800-fuck-this-shit\nSeven years old in my heart, so I'm stayin' gold\nBut when I fuckin' go, Lucifer will probably have my soul\nIt's hot down there, fuck that, bitch I'm hot as coals\nOut the microwave, mixed with a bowl of yellow raviol\nAnd a firetruck and Arizona durin' summertime\nIn a turtle neck, thermal jeans, spit purple wine\nWolf Gang pete and gon' live, running outta time\nThe fuck I give is the same as the next line\n\n(Fuck everything) That's what my conscience said\nThen it bunny hopped off my shoulder, now my conscience dead\nSo the only guidance that I had is splattered on cement\nActions speak louder than words, let me try this shit", "image":

all red of old gangs\nAnd now you've seen your stars and your face numb like a funny bone cupping at ice\nAnd your nose white like your head's covered in lice\nBut we both dazed, and I think I found my wife\n\nDazed and Amazed and I'm dazed and I'm blown\nDazed and Amazed and I'm dazed and I'm gone\nDazed and Amazed and I'm dazed and I'm home\n\n\nChilling at the house on the couch, nose white\nMind is travelling, thoughts is mental\nI'm trying to get into your pus just like a pimple\nAnd I wait for the Cat in the Hat to pop through the window\nThe opium is in slow\nThin Though\nPut My Brim Low\nLet the lights dim low"}}, {"title": "DEATHCAMP", "album": "Cherry Bomb", "year": "2015-04-09", "lyrics": "Um, excuse me mister but can you please turn down the lights?\nI don't really like all these cameras, man\nAnd this shit just don't feel right\nAnd I don't really wanna be rude to you, sir\nBut fuck you mean I can't wear my hat in here?\nAnd you got me fucked up, if you think I care, nigga\n\nI hope you little niggas is listening\nThem Golf Boys is in this bitch like an infant\nThe blind niggas used to make fun of my vision\nAnd now I pay a mortage and they stuck with tuition\nSo special the teacher asked if I was autistic\nAnd now I'm making plates, you just washing the dishes\nSo if you don't mind, get the fuck out of my kitchen\nBut keep your ego here so I can butt fuck your opinion\nBut in the meantime brainwashing millions of minions\nLeader of the new school? (Ha, I'm in my own school)\nAnd you would never catch me in none of their fucking shin-digs\nI hope you fucking niggas is angry, pissed, and offended\nIn Search of... did more for me than Illmatic\nThat's when I realized we ain't cut from the same fabric\nI made my own shit, you went out and bought yours\nMan I got too much drive, motherfucker, I hate traffic\nLa-di-da-di, I'm going harder than coming out the closet to conservative Christian fathers\nWhen it's a lot at stake carne asada let's be honest, I'm really morphing\nNamed the album Cherry Bomb because Greatest Hits sounded boring\nI don't like to follow the rules, she said that I must\nI don't have any armpits\nShe wanted to talk who's in charge of this Golf shit\nI said \"Howdy do? How are you? I'm the sergeant\"\nAnd who I are isn't really important\nMy heart is as dark as a window with car tint\nSo hop in with your friends, gal and I'll unpark it\nAnd I'll do donuts until the fat one is carsick\nIt's young T\n\nI don't like to follow the rules\nAnd that's just who I am\nI hope you understand\nAnd I don't really think y'all cool\nSo give yourself a hand\nNo, no, give yourself a hand\nBetter pose for that camera\nBetter pose, boy you better pose\nAnd it's your life nigga I suppose\nFor the lights, for the camera, and the action\nNow you're face is meltin' from the flash of the big ol' lights\nNigga you ask for this life\n\nWelcome to death camp\nYeah, welcome to death camp\nYeah, welcome to death camp\nKissing on my bean bag\nYour lips high-five my tongue\nFingers moonwalk through your hair\n(For the lights, and the camera, and the action)\nThis is fun I can tell\nI don't know if you'll handle it well\nWelcome to hell camp\n(Lights, and the camera, and the action)\nYou should be mine in a way tonight\n(For the lights, and the camera, and the action)", "image": "https://images.genius.com/dd2408d3a2d34699d2bb3e448679b7f1.1000x1000x1.jpg", "artist":

right\nAnd I don't really wanna be rude to you, sir\nBut fuck you mean I can't wear my hat in here?\nAnd you got me fucked up, if you think I care, nigga\n\nI hope you little niggas is listening\nThem Golf Boys is in this bitch like an infant\nThe blind niggas used to make fun of my vision\nAnd now I pay a mortage and they stuck with tuition\nSo special the teacher asked if I was autistic\nAnd now I'm making plates, you just washing the dishes\nSo if you don't mind, get the fuck out of my kitchen\nBut keep your ego here so I can butt fuck your opinion\nBut in the meantime brainwashing millions of minions\nLeader of the new school? (Ha, I'm in my own school)\nAnd you would never catch me in none of their fucking shin-digs\nI hope you fucking niggas is angry, pissed, and offended\nIn Search of... did more for me than Illmatic\nThat's when I realized we ain't cut from the same fabric\nI made my own shit, you went out and bought yours\nMan I got too much drive, motherfucker, I hate traffic\nLa-di-da-di, I'm going harder than coming out the closet to conservative Christian fathers\nWhen it's a lot at stake carne asada let's be honest, I'm really morphing\nNamed the album Cherry Bomb because Greatest Hits sounded boring\nI don't like to follow the rules, she said that I must\nI don't have any armpits\nShe wanted to talk who's in charge of this Golf shit\nI said \"Howdy do? How are you? I'm the sergeant\"\nAnd who I are isn't really important\nMy heart is as dark as a window with car tint\nSo hop in with your friends, gal and I'll unpark it\nAnd I'll do donuts until the fat one is carsick\nIt's young T\n\nI don't like to follow the rules\nAnd that's just who I am\nI hope you understand\nAnd I don't really think y'all cool\nSo give yourself a hand\nNo, no, give yourself a hand\nBetter pose for that camera\nBetter pose, boy you better pose\nAnd it's your life nigga I suppose\nFor the lights, for the camera, and the action\nNow you're face is meltin' from the flash of the big ol' lights\nNigga you ask for this life\n\nWelcome to death camp\nYeah, welcome to death camp\nYeah, welcome to death camp\nKissing on my bean bag\nYour lips high-five my tongue\nFingers moonwalk through your hair\n(For the lights, and the camera, and the action)\nThis is fun I can tell\nI don't know if you'll handle it well\nWelcome to hell camp\n(Lights, and the camera, and the action)\nYou should be mine in a way tonight\n(For the lights, and the camera, and the action)"}}, {"title": "Dem Hoes", "album": null, "year": null, "lyrics": "Odd Future stay GPA 6.66\n.66 dicks

they knee pads\nSucking up all the white like their tummy's made for the bleaches\nThe teachers are getting antsy and acting like fucking pansies\nAssault rifles for teachers wanna' romance me\nMr. Lee had his hands where his youngest teen daughter hands be\nNow she wanna' sit down because she can't stand me\nSo I made her an amputee wooden planks where her legs be\nEat ass like candy, giving

I'm broke\nBitch, I ate one roach and I made a lot of money\nPopping since Bastard, (manager) Clancy's my slave master\nThanks to them crackers, my pockets are fatter than excess shit that's weighing on Jasper\nI've never popped a bottle, but I've fucked a couple models in Europe\nYup, and a couple of them swallowed\nMeet me half way, bitch I'm going all in\nAnd I never pull back, shout-out to my nigga Taco\n\nFuck that, Golf Wang\nFuck that, Golf Wang\nFuck that, Golf Wang\nFuck that, (Golf Wang!)\nFuck that, Golf Wang\nFuck that, Golf Wang\nFuck that, Golf Wang\nFuck that, Golf Wang\n\nSo, a couple fags threw a little hissfit\nCame to Pitchfork with a couple Jada Pinkett signs\nAnd said I was a racist homophobic\nSo I grabbed Lucas and filmed us kissing\nFeelings getting caught, it's off, I'm pissing\nYou think I give a fuck? I ain't even stick my dick in yet\n(No homo. Too soon.)\nAnd while y'all are rolling doobies\nI be in my bedroom scoring movies\nStill excited like a fucking newbie\nSuck my dick, motherfucker, sue me\nMom got a new whip so she could scoop me\nA year ago, I ain't have no hoopty\nFour story home, gotta climb eight set of stairs\nJust to see where my fucking roof be\n\nFuck that, Golf Wang\nFuck that, Golf Wang\nFuck that, Golf Wang\nFuck that, (Golf Wang!)\nFuck that, Golf Wang\nFuck that, Golf Wang\nFuck that, Golf Wang\nFuck that, Golf Wang\n\nWait a God damn second\nI'm tripping balls, David Beckham\nWould fall cause shit's going down\nJust like Rodney King swimming lessons\nNow me and Justin smoke sherm and been talking 'bout freeing perms\nAnd purchasing weapons, naming them and aim 'em in One Direction\n(wait a minute)\nIt sounds like midgets in a God damn speaker\nAnytime you play this shit loud\nBut that's just me trying to get milk now\nAnd the grunts of the god damn cow\nHit me on my beeper while Captain Hook suck my Peter\nPan camera, repeat procedure\nAnd when the beat drop, have a goddamn seizure\n\nFuck that, Golf Wang\nFuck that, Golf Wang\nFuck that, Golf Wang\nFuck that, (Golf Wang!)\nFuck that, Golf Wang\nFuck that, Golf Wang\nFuck that, Golf Wang\nFuck that, Golf Wang\nFuck that, Golf Wang\nFuck that, Golf Wang\nFuck that, Golf Wang\nFuck that, (Golf Wang!)\nFuck that, Golf Wang\nFuck that, Golf Wang\nFuck that, Golf Wang\nFuck that, Golf Wang\n\nCut it out! I said I didn\u2019t want no goddamn lettuce. I don\u2019t want that shit! I don\u2019t want your goddamn lettuce.

ask your mammy\nNever played golf, but got a driver and a Caddy\nWhole squad slammin' like Onyx, you know Sticky Fingaz\nSome drop science, I'm droppin' English\nEven if Tyler named the song \"Flower\"\nNo seeds in the bud, still don't trust bugs\nI'm down\n\nDroppin' seeds on these niggas\nThey can't fuck with the boy (Mula!)\nDroppin' seeds on these bitches\nFor the love of the

inspiration. I'm 23 fucking years old and I built a fucking monster and I'm not ever gonna fucking land. Stop being scared and negative. Start believing in yourself and stop living for all these other fucking idiots. Some of y'all should put that fucking blunt down and go do what the fuck you know you need to do. Do it for yourself. I believe in everyone because I believe in myself. Fuck reaching for the stars, that's setting a limit. Fuck those. Some of you don't like yourself. Some of you aren't comfortable with yourself. That's so fucking sad. Stop that shit. Some of you can't. That's why y'all ask for likes on Instagram and shit, because y'all's self esteem is so fucking low. Cut that shit out and start liking yourself. When that happens, you will start trusting yourself, then you trust your ideas, then you fucking become that person you really want to be. If you don't have any confidence, let me be your fucking confidence\nI'm gonna be a fucking great years from now and I fully believe that and fully do not care about anyone's opinion on why I'm not because I know. Start smiling more and start hanging around people that makes you feel good or make you want to be better. Stop associating with losers. If a nigga only hits you up to smoke or drink or turn up and have nothing else to offer to get you where ever you think about being when you are alone daydreaming, then get the fuck away from them. Time is going by so fast and before you know it, you're gonna be on your deathbed telling stories about how much you sucked and how you regret not living the life you wanted to live, loving the people you wanted to love, taking the chances you wanted to take. THERE ARE NO RULES. FUCK THE RULES. GO. FIND YOUR WINGS. I FOUND MY WINGS AND I'M STILL FLYING AND I WILL NEVER EVER LAND. Some of you have to find yourself. I knew who I was at like age 10. I knew the music, I loved the colors, and I knew what I was into. Most of you listen to what ever is hot or what your friends like, y'all dress how everyone else dresses, y'all do what everyone else does. FUCKING STOP BEING A FUCKING FOLLOWER. Read the comments, the weak ass follower that will never make a difference ever because they fucking suck are gonna say some shit like \"easier said than done\" or \"you are a hypocrite\" or \"you changed\" or some stupid shit like that, because they are the weak fucks that I'm talking about and they can't cope with it, cause they are scared. DON'T BE SCARED\nI don't know why I'm typing this. I'm on a lake on vacation just drawing and listening to music (I've been playing CC The World for like 6 hours) and I just realized, \"Oh wow! I'm on a vacation for no reason, this is crazy. I've dreamed of this. How did I get this far? Oh yeah, by trusting myself and not following the path that my mom wanted me to go, and by surrounding myself with other people that wanted more out of life and trusted my wild ideas, and I put my art out there and people liked it and trusted me, and now I'm here. I guess what I'm trying to say is that I want everyone to win. I want everyone to smile. I want everyone to be in a good mood and annoying and always jumping around like me cause I'm so fucking happy and grateful, but I realize niggas is scared. Or who knows, maybe I'm just a special one. I don't know anything. I'm in the woods and I really want to meet a moose in person. If I see one I'm gonna get a photo. Hahahahahaha. Oh, and RACISM IS FUCKING WEAK AS FUCK ANTI GOLF BOYS. This saturday, there will be another fall/winter drop from GOLF. Love you. Today, I want you to find your wings", "image": "https://images.genius.com/9c1283d00776db51fc43807c4115e21a.440x440x1.jpg", "artist": "Tyler, The Creator", "raw": {"annotation_count": 1, "api_path":

I'm 23 fucking years old and I built a fucking monster and I'm not ever gonna fucking land. Stop being scared and negative. Start believing in yourself and stop living for all these other fucking idiots. Some of y'all should put that fucking blunt down and go do what the fuck you know you need to do. Do it for yourself. I believe in everyone because I believe in myself. Fuck reaching for the stars, that's setting a limit. Fuck those. Some of you don't like yourself. Some of you aren't comfortable with yourself. That's so fucking sad. Stop that shit. Some of you can't. That's why y'all ask for likes on Instagram and shit, because y'all's self esteem is so fucking low. Cut that shit out and start liking yourself. When that happens, you will start trusting yourself, then you trust your ideas, then you fucking become that person you really want to be. If you don't have any confidence, let me be your fucking confidence\nI'm gonna be a fucking great years from now and I fully believe that and fully do not care about anyone's opinion on why I'm not because I know. Start smiling more and start hanging around people that makes you feel good or make you want to be better. Stop associating with losers. If a nigga only hits you up to smoke or drink or turn up and have nothing else to offer to get you where ever you think about being when you are alone daydreaming, then get the fuck away from them. Time is going by so fast and before you know it, you're gonna be on your deathbed telling stories about how much you sucked and how you regret not living the life you wanted to live, loving the people you wanted to love, taking the chances you wanted to take. THERE ARE NO RULES. FUCK THE RULES. GO. FIND YOUR WINGS. I FOUND MY WINGS AND I'M STILL FLYING AND I WILL NEVER EVER LAND. Some of you have to find yourself. I knew who I was at like age 10. I knew the music, I loved the colors, and I knew what I was into. Most of you listen to what ever is hot or what your friends like, y'all dress how everyone else dresses, y'all do what everyone else does. FUCKING STOP BEING A FUCKING FOLLOWER. Read the comments, the weak ass follower that will never make a difference ever because they fucking suck are gonna say some shit like \"easier said than done\" or \"you are a hypocrite\" or \"you changed\" or some stupid shit like that, because they are the weak fucks that I'm talking about and they can't cope with it, cause they are scared. DON'T BE SCARED\nI don't know why I'm typing this. I'm on a lake on vacation just drawing and listening to music (I've been playing CC The World for like 6 hours) and I just realized, \"Oh wow! I'm on a vacation for no reason, this is crazy. I've dreamed of this. How did I get this far? Oh yeah, by trusting myself and not following the path that my mom wanted me to go, and by surrounding myself with other people that wanted more out of life and trusted my wild ideas, and I put my art out there and people liked it and trusted me, and now I'm here. I guess what I'm trying to say is that I want everyone to win. I want everyone to smile. I want everyone to be in a good mood and annoying and always jumping around like me cause I'm so fucking happy and grateful, but I realize niggas is scared. Or who knows, maybe I'm just a special one. I don't know anything. I'm in the woods and I really want to meet a moose in person. If I see one I'm gonna get a photo. Hahahahahaha. Oh, and RACISM IS FUCKING WEAK AS FUCK ANTI GOLF BOYS. This saturday, there will be another fall/winter drop from GOLF. Love you. Today, I want you to find your wings"}}, {"title": "Fin", "album": "The Odd Future Tape", "year": "2008-11-15", "lyrics": "Man, I feel like, I'll win a Grammy, y'know?\nI had a, a dream, y'knahmean?\nRight now I'm livin the first scene, y'know?\nThis gon' be a long thank you, umm\nThank you to, Left Brain, Hodgy Beats\nCasey Veggies, Super 3, Matt Martians\nMom, I love you, I made it!\nThe whole family, shit umm\nDevon, Shaun, R.C., Juan\nChris, Robert, Randy, Aaron\nJasmine, Jackson, Taj, Grand\nChristina, Milan, Geo, Yan\nIce, Skyler, Daniel, Mookie\nMars, Urbie, Josh, Jason\nDomo, Katano, Brandun Deshay\nUhhh...\nBig ups to Sould Banana Crew\nMy whole Grind Time Family\nKicks Material, Ill Boss, Switch\nErykah Veggies, Casen Kreation\nYou know all the blogs that held me down\nBig ups to all my niggas at the DIRTY~! man\nDirty!

wings)\n(My lil nigga, the world is yours, birdy)\n\nWe can go down to the rainbows\nDon't let your high keep your brain low\nYou're a bird\nYou're supposed to fly away\nThe way you stand there\nDon't

her drink, and in the blink of an eye\nI can make a white girl look chink\nDon't know what to think, 'cause last time I attempted this shit\nThe judge ordered me to see a shrink\nStarted with the link\nContended her to meet me at the local\nOdd Future Wolf Gang skating rink\nWe was uniquely in sync\nAlready fucking and we only met last week\nWe were both young, not yet antique\nSo her mindset was working for my technique\nTell her that I love her and by next week\nYou can hear her shriek from the gashes in her cheeks\nNo, I'm not a freak, I am meekly a creep\nThe neighbors by the creek says my house stinks\nAnd it reeks on the sheet, girl\nStreaks of red, even though all pussy is pink\nOblivion makes obvious seeks\nWhich make meats for my obvious feasts\nUsed to just blot up thoughts, plot, and rethink\nNow I get daughters and tie 'em and clink\nGot my dick harder than iron and zinc\nNow they just rot up, arms caught in the sink\nWhere they get cut up to fit my physique\nCritique my chic in this brand new mink\nGo\n\nYeah, Wolf Gang\nWolf Haley\nAll good?\nCool.  We cool?\n\nBitches running 'round, down pussy take a trip\nMake her strip, got my dick harder than the unzip\nTyler swiftly slips his dick inside of Taylor Swift's slit\nRound trip in that pussy, here comes a ticket\nFilm clips popping on that Canon\nBusting Ottoman cannons, on the pill\nIs he real? Gaza stripping in my living room\nWolf Gang full moon, I'm assuming mushrooms\nI'm a necrolampoon, not of Charles Mansoon\nThis fuck is ending soon because I'm ejaculating\n\n(Frankie, Frankie)\nNow I'd like to take this time of day\nTo thank the Mother Earth\n(Thank you Momma, thank you Momma)\nLetting the sun shine down on the lake\nWhile I fish your waters\nOoh, hide your daughters, hide your sisters\nHell, hide grandmama too (Grand, yeah)\n'Cause the fisherman's raping everybody in the pool\nHe on the loose, yeah\n\nGot to wash it down, all this gold is fucking bait\nWait 'til you see the semen swimming\nBaby, please not half, the whole is great\nMorals? Your body's near that coral reef\nIt was once upon a time you came home with me\nThen the next chapter left you in my teeth\nFill your gills with goo\nGoing deeper than Pacific Ocean\nThis specific motion\nMakes this hammerhead puke\nGot to wear a wetsuit, can\u2019t get seasick\nI love when you're in fishnets, you want me to eat you\nYou\u2019re fucking wet, fish\nPart 2 - Boppin' Bitch\n\nSo I met this girl at the club\nAnd I just wanted her to suck my dick\nAnd that's 'cause (She's a boppin' bitch)\nNow she's drunk and talkin' to me a lot\nUntil we go to another room\nAnd that's 'cause (She's a boppin' bitch)\n\nThis little slut whore sucks cock for a little more bucks\nThan them other sluts fuck for, real easy\nCause I didn't even knock on the front door, sleazy\nI used the welcome mat as a cum rag\nAnd all the Wolves fucked too, yeah she\u2019s a cum bag\nFilled with a bunch of shit I purchased at a drug store\nFour more Dora-looking sluts let me explore\nUntil my cock got sore and started growing cold sores\n\nNow she thinks that I like her\nBut all I really wanted was that mouth\nAnd that's 'cause (She's a boppin' bitch)\nNow she text messages me every day\nAnd I don't ever hit that bitch back\nAnd that's because (She's a boppin' bitch)\n\nThis little hoodrat started jockin at my jock strap\nUntil my uncircumcised penis finally unwrapped\nFlapping up and down until the cack finally go splat\nNow you gotta spat, spit it out until you do scat\nThen you gotta sat and shit it out, bitch, fuck your feelings\nYou wasn\u2019t feeling shit when you was down there kneeling\nNow shut the fuck up you got another dick to deal with\n\nNow why can't we fuck with this bitch? (She's boppin')\nWait, tell him why we can\u2019t fuck with this bitch? (That bitch she boppin')\nWhat is she? She a BB, what does that stand for? (She boppin')\nShe, what do she be doin'? (She boppin')\n\nNow I'm at a fuckin' clinic\nCause my dick is swollen' and keeps itchin'\nNigga, I'mma kill this bitch (She's a boppin' bitch)\n\nWhere's my gun? I'mma kill this bitch\nTo all my niggas out there listening, that bitch (She's boppin')\nAnd don't let her suck your dick or you'll get hurt", "image":

ordered me to see a shrink\nStarted with the link\nContended her to meet me at the local\nOdd Future Wolf Gang skating rink\nWe was uniquely in sync\nAlready fucking and we only met last week\nWe were both young, not yet antique\nSo her mindset was working for my technique\nTell her that I love her and by next week\nYou can hear her shriek from the gashes in her cheeks\nNo, I'm not a freak, I am meekly a creep\nThe neighbors by the creek says my house stinks\nAnd it reeks on the sheet, girl\nStreaks of red, even though all pussy is pink\nOblivion makes obvious seeks\nWhich make meats for my obvious feasts\nUsed to just blot up thoughts, plot, and rethink\nNow I get daughters and tie 'em and clink\nGot my dick harder than iron and zinc\nNow they just rot up, arms caught in the sink\nWhere they get cut up to fit my physique\nCritique my chic in this brand new mink\nGo\n\nYeah, Wolf Gang\nWolf Haley\nAll good?\nCool.  We cool?\n\nBitches running 'round, down pussy take a trip\nMake her strip, got my dick harder than the unzip\nTyler swiftly slips his dick inside of Taylor Swift's slit\nRound trip in that pussy, here comes a ticket\nFilm clips popping on that Canon\nBusting Ottoman cannons, on the pill\nIs he real? Gaza stripping in my living room\nWolf Gang full moon, I'm assuming mushrooms\nI'm a necrolampoon, not of Charles Mansoon\nThis fuck is ending soon because I'm ejaculating\n\n(Frankie, Frankie)\nNow I'd like to take this time of day\nTo thank the Mother Earth\n(Thank you Momma, thank you Momma)\nLetting the sun shine down on the lake\nWhile I fish your waters\nOoh, hide your daughters, hide your sisters\nHell, hide grandmama too (Grand, yeah)\n'Cause the fisherman's raping everybody in the pool\nHe on the loose, yeah\n\nGot to wash it down, all this gold is fucking bait\nWait 'til you see the semen swimming\nBaby, please not half, the whole is great\nMorals? Your body's near that coral reef\nIt was once upon a time you came home with me\nThen the next chapter left you in my teeth\nFill your gills with goo\nGoing deeper than Pacific Ocean\nThis specific motion\nMakes this hammerhead puke\nGot to wear a wetsuit, can\u2019t get seasick\nI love when you're in fishnets, you want me to eat you\nYou\u2019re fucking wet, fish\nPart 2 - Boppin' Bitch\n\nSo I met this girl at the club\nAnd I just wanted her to suck my dick\nAnd that's 'cause (She's a boppin' bitch)\nNow she's drunk and talkin' to me a lot\nUntil we go to another room\nAnd that's 'cause (She's a boppin' bitch)\n\nThis little slut whore sucks cock for a little more bucks\nThan them other sluts fuck for, real easy\nCause I didn't even knock on the front door, sleazy\nI used the welcome mat as a cum rag\nAnd all the Wolves fucked too, yeah she\u2019s a cum bag\nFilled with a bunch of shit I purchased at a drug store\nFour more Dora-looking sluts let me explore\nUntil my cock got sore and started growing cold sores\n\nNow she thinks that I like her\nBut all I really wanted was that mouth\nAnd that's 'cause (She's a boppin' bitch)\nNow she text messages me every day\nAnd I don't ever hit that bitch back\nAnd that's because (She's a boppin' bitch)\n\nThis little hoodrat started jockin at my jock strap\nUntil my uncircumcised penis finally unwrapped\nFlapping up and down until the cack finally go splat\nNow you gotta spat, spit it out until you do scat\nThen you gotta sat and shit it out, bitch, fuck your feelings\nYou wasn\u2019t feeling shit when you was down there kneeling\nNow shut the fuck up you got another dick to deal with\n\nNow why can't we fuck with this bitch? (She's boppin')\nWait, tell him why we can\u2019t fuck with this bitch? (That bitch she boppin')\nWhat is she? She a BB, what does that stand for? (She boppin')\nShe, what do she be doin'? (She boppin')\n\nNow I'm at a fuckin' clinic\nCause my dick is swollen' and keeps itchin'\nNigga, I'mma kill this bitch (She's a boppin' bitch)\n\nWhere's my gun? I'mma kill this bitch\nTo all my niggas out there listening, that bitch (She's boppin')\nAnd don't let her suck your dick or you'll get hurt"}}, {"title": "Flower Boy: a conversation", "album":

questions a lot of\n00:44\nThe song just have questioning is just\n00:45\nLike how am I feeling today mmm-hmm fuck\n00:48\nWhat if I go poor again what if the\n00:49\nDoesn't work and then that's how a lot\n00:51\nOf the song has happened just me kind of\n00:53\nJust asking these core answering these\n00:55\nQuestions like so but I speaking to like\n00:58\nA move you were in like like you\n01:01\nRecorded this one when did you but\n01:03\nMostly mm see like I started to indie\n01:06\n2015 a lot of spring/summer 2016 and in\n01:09\nA lot of fall what were you listening to\n01:12\nLike um like watching and let's hop\n01:14\nMusic I was like listening that\n01:17\nStructure I kinda just what like Max\n01:21\nMartin was doing and really getting into\n01:24\nWhat what Pharrell and Justin was doing\n01:27\nYeah and just noticing just hook I\n01:31\nHanging out with Travis taco Hey I went\n01:34\nTo club with him and just seeing what\n01:36\nPeople how people reacted didn't ever go\n01:39\nTo the clubs I hate them you know I go\n01:41\nTo club when I would go I would just\n01:43\nStudy oh that that bass drop or all that\n01:46\nGirl loves that part just like okay I\n01:48\nWant to have a song that has that\n01:51\nFeeling you know I kind of was like okay\n01:53\nI want to see challenge myself and try\n01:55\nTo make a few song that's not like a\n01:58\nRabbit-ear appier super distorted I was\n02:01\nLike last night I went to me Lionel into\n02:04\nLike a house party and they they all the\n02:06\nSong they were playing seniorita by\n02:08\nJustin tell me by total front and by\n02:11\nPeople I call these house parties\n02:13\nAnd see you again came on and it's full\n02:16\nOf black people yeah for sure go to\n02:18\nClubs yeah and they were in there like\n02:20\nSinging the lyrics and I was like oh\n02:21\nShit I've always wanted that so just\n02:24\nHave black people ID dance yeah yeah so\n02:27\nYou're so hyped and I was we were\n02:29\nPlaying Jenga and I was being cool about\n02:30\nIt but inside I was like oh she's going\n02:32\nCrazy finally have something that they\n02:35\nCould do that to you it's funny because\n02:37\nI guess I wouldn't have like thought\n02:39\nAbout how much like pop is you know\n02:42\nInfluenced in the album because because\n02:45\nOf like the subject matter like a lot of\n02:48\nIt is so heavy that's why I was just\n02:50\nWondering where you were in like a place\n02:51\nOf just like hey you gotta feed you put\n02:54\nThe over here so you put the medicine in\n02:57\nLike the so like mr. lonely I was like\n03:02\nOh dude I want to write the saddest song\n03:04\nI could possibly write and see people go\n03:06\nCrazy and like dance to it yeah it's\n03:09\nThat and not the shows that show that\n03:10\nSong is insane and it's the saddest song\n03:12\nI've ever wrote yeah it really and you\n03:15\nDance I mean it's so hard it's so hard\n03:18\nAnd like the greatest like bridge what\n03:22\nWas that what was that I don't know if\n03:23\nWe I mean I'm just gonna kind of jump\n03:25\nInto various songs but like what what\n03:27\nWas like specifically that like trip why\n03:31\nThat transition like why did you think\n03:33\nThat was like needed a transit like was\n03:36\nIt like it for emotional like were you\n03:38\nTrying to create snow\n03:39\nNine-one-one a mr. lonely originally was\n03:44\nDifferent song kind of together it was\n03:46\nThis jazz take a hat that was super\n03:48\nTriumphal even just sounded grand and a\n03:51\nLot of those lyrics was uh was in that\n03:55\nSong and I just took him and just place\n03:58\nThem on nine one one and then took the\n04:01\nVerse and placed it on mr. lonely and\n04:03\nAdded some stuff and nine-one-one the\n04:06\nSong the version I came out is the 25th\n04:08\nVersion in waves for the twenty fifth\n04:10\nTwenty fifty five of those twenty four\n04:13\nThe first version was over a interlude\n04:15\nSong that Tony Toni ton\u00e9 had i looped it\n04:19\nSang over that like the hook that I put\n04:21\nThere made 30 beats for it it's in the\n04:24\nVersions are just different\n04:26\nType of lyrics it's literally like\n04:29\nDifferent beads different melodies\n04:31\nDifferent about mate that took the beat\n04:33\nFrom the fashion show I did\n04:34\nWe worked at took the lyrics from the\n04:37\nOriginal mr. lonely and like\n04:39\nImplementing it in that and like so the\n04:42\nOriginal mr. lonely it's like a five car\n04:45\nGarage for ten good guys some coffee for\n04:49\nEvery day of the week and it go really\n04:51\nFast but it means nothing nothing\n04:54\nNothing without you shotgun yeah right\n04:58\nYeah that's in the last version I want\n05:01\nFive car garage full tank of gas but\n05:03\nThat'll mean nothing not so you kept\n05:05\nThat baseball bat excitedly jazz on me\n05:09\nYeah now I want I want them to groove to\n05:12\nThis shit so I'll put it on there I\n05:13\nActually always wondered why bat nothing\n05:15\nLike why bad repeat well yeah it just\n05:17\nCuz it was from it was it was probably\n05:19\nThe bass to the other one but when I put\n05:21\nIt there and drop the B people I was\n05:23\nLike oh people are gonna love saying\n05:24\nThis and if you see that shows I don't\n05:26\nEven say it I just put the mic in no and\n05:31\nI'm like I figured it out and then I get\n05:34\nOut the that with that feeling that you\n05:37\nFeeling of just everybody really\n05:39\nConnected with it but don't wait\n05:40\nSpecifically the bridge on that like\n05:43\nWell wait the church air part yeah well\n05:46\nThen I guess a brick but like what like\n05:48\nWhich is the most one of the most\n05:50\nAddictive I ain't made that I remember I\n05:54\nMade that bridge and he was just the\n05:55\nBeat and I remember stopping like I made\n05:58\nThe bridge that I've always wanted to\n06:01\nMake Lonnie came by our Frank however\n06:03\nPeople uh and he came by and I played it\n06:06\nFor him he's like you let me go in there\n06:07\nJust try something\n06:08\nHe just started making phone noises and\n06:10\nIt worked out so perfectly and alright\n06:14\nAnd we kept it was it longer no okay no\n06:17\nThat part I'm just giving it as eight\n06:19\nBars of these chords just so they could\n06:21\nWant it yeah when I replay it and that's\n06:24\nIt at that that's okay so how did you\n06:26\nBalance out and this is kind of for the\n06:28\nWhole album your love of chords with you\n06:32\nAlways talk about and you always say\n06:34\nNiggas don't want courts they don't and\n06:37\nThat's everything that you that's all\n06:38\nYou're obsessed\n06:40\nI was just everything is specific I just\n06:42\nWant chords and melodies yeah and was it\n06:45\nLike a was it like a battle for cuz the\n06:47\nWhole album has chords yeah well I\n06:49\nFucked up I don't fuck up but cherry\n06:51\nBond was hard to get into cuz it was a\n06:53\nWhole album of bridges and shit going\n06:55\nEverywhere so I was like okay let me for\n06:58\nThis album specifically add all the\n07:00\nChords I like but do it in a way they\n07:02\nCould not Jess\n07:03\nSo mr. lonely has some of the prettiest\n07:05\nChords or the album yeah\n07:07\nBut I kind of hid it behind the hard\n07:09\nDrums and the fast pace rap but if you\n07:12\nReally listen it's really fuckin pretty\n07:15\nAnd I was like thank you I was like I\n07:19\nWas like I'm definitely gonna just try\n07:22\nTo hide it in those and stuff and I\n07:24\nWon't want even the UH call me sometime\n07:26\nI wasn't in a gap man I was like damn\n07:28\nThese are simple chords and I love the\n07:30\nMelody let me try to implement it in\n07:31\nThis and make it as simple as possible\n07:34\nBut it still gives me that feeling so\n07:37\nThe part where I was like not fuckin I'm\n07:39\nGonna get crazy is right one Steve\n07:41\nLacey's parts over and it goes back to\n07:42\nThe hood and it's that done - done yeah\n07:44\nIt goes down yeah I was like I'm gonna\n07:46\nGo on my Jill Scott she but that's my\n07:48\nFavorite part of that song just cuz it\n07:50\nJust it has all the chords that you love\n07:52\nIt exactly oh do you wanna a weak Akane\n07:56\nOkay\n07:57\n08:02\nI can't even lie wait wait like what I\n08:07\nJust imagine a nigga and a wife beater\n08:12\nAnd like is he talking to his friends I\n08:16\nDon't know in the market too but it's a\n08:17\nQuick shot it I think about but I can't\n08:19\nEven live it lonely it's fun just being\n08:22\nHonest with his homies or something and\n08:24\nI was just like man I'll be really\n08:25\nVillainy to chant but it's the perfect\n08:28\nSetup for when that song like comes on\n08:30\nYeah and it sets you up for like what's\n08:33\nAbout to happen it's honest but it's\n08:36\nIt's right here and they go crazy but\n08:39\nIt's like so sad it's hilarious yeah\n08:41\nIt's like this there's a group in\n08:43\nBiggest and that's rocky that's rocky\n08:45\nJelena\n08:46\nOh that's rocky that's cute I think\n08:48\nThat's Wyatt that's Lionel that's Jasper\n08:51\nAll right forward is okay first of all\n08:59\nThat tempo was very weird it's like a\n09:03\nReally weird simple that you felt like\n09:05\nWas it just kind of like a what so\n09:06\nThat's a that's a loop from his band\n09:08\nCalled can and um I've always been in a\n09:12\nCroc rockets like it was a sound I was\n09:14\nLike very European Eastern Europe and\n09:17\nYou have like can you have the Silver\n09:19\nApples even even soft machine which was\n09:23\nThis really prog jazz band took like\n09:25\nInfluence around that time and it's kind\n09:26\nOf what portishead listens to the\n09:28\nInfluence and it's something I've always\n09:30\nLiked because it was just so weird and\n09:32\nJust these weird drum patterns and just\n09:34\nAll these haunting bass lines and that's\n09:37\nThat's the song that they had and every\n09:39\nTime I would play it I would just wrap\n09:40\nOver it and I was like you know fucking\n09:42\nI'm a loop 'add and is it hard to breath\n09:45\nOver that no not actually it's it's\n09:47\nActually just a one two three four but\n09:50\nSome buckets that they we use makes it\n09:53\nSound like this weird push-pull back\n09:56\nThing yes that's what it feels like it\n09:58\nLike your own something you don't mean\n10:00\nIt just kind of pulls like yeah yeah and\n10:02\nIt's like well because that pocket is\n10:04\nSuch a like the pace of it is a like\n10:08\nWhen you when you're rapping over it's\n10:10\nLike you do a little bit faster than I\n10:12\nWould\n10:12\nYou don't mean like it's like a little\n10:14\nBit more why why that song first why'd\n10:18\nThat move first up like I just were you\n10:21\nTrying to set up\n10:22\nI I don't know I just been making it\n10:24\nLike this needs to be the first song\n10:25\nJust going just so you can see where I'm\n10:27\nAt in my head and I'll remember writing\n10:30\nThat first fully just like I mean like\n10:35\nReally wondering like how much she\n10:38\nCannot buy until it gets boring like how\n10:42\nMany jumps could I do on a bike and so\n10:43\nI'm over it and I'm off to the next\n10:45\nThing know every answer that I kinda I\n10:48\nDon't know I went to the next question\n10:49\nLike it don't sell me or enough it was\n10:52\nSo existential and contemplatively\n10:54\nSounded suicidal especially like look\n10:56\nLike if I'm going and don't let you know\n10:58\nYou don't really got way that's that was\n11:01\nThe end question like damn what if he's\n11:03\nJust know what if I died what happens\n11:05\nYeah that's kind of what it was and it\n11:07\nJust to set the tone of like that's\n11:10\nWrong yeah is it it's not the print like\n11:13\nI'm not depressed at all and a lot of\n11:15\nPeople mix up depression with\n11:17\nSelf-awareness yeah and like like\n11:20\nSomeone's like do too Salinger person\n11:21\nLike no I never said I was depressed\n11:22\nI'm lonely but I'm having the most fun\n11:25\nOf my goddamn life yeah and but that\n11:27\nSong kind of sets like that tone but if\n11:30\nYou're okay I mean if you're not if if\n11:33\nYou're considering death right but it's\n11:35\nNot from a depressed like sad state is\n11:37\nIt from a place of like alright I got\n11:40\nSomething to prove cuz it almost seems\n11:42\nLike you had like a thing to prove with\n11:45\nThis with this album like just I don't\n11:47\nKnow to yourself or well you always a\n11:50\nLot of people do stuff for the\n11:52\nConversation of when they're dead\n11:54\nMmm-hmm like hopefully when I die people\n11:57\nWho could say oh he this this and this\n11:59\nGood stuff i I leave a good this Agra\n12:01\nFree behind but yeah I like to start\n12:03\nWith every project I like to start from\n12:06\nDeath and work that exactly it's just\n12:08\nLike we're all gonna die someday one I\n12:11\nJust I just knew if this album wasn't\n12:13\nGood I will be fucked that's how I felt\n12:17\nIt some people would disagree but I'm\n12:18\nLike man I'm not I'm nothing right now\n12:21\nYou felt that way coming off Cherry Bomb\n12:23\nYeah yeah cuz everyone hate it except\n12:25\nFor like\n12:26\nMusic laughing cares about drums like I\n12:29\nOpened a rap album with a rock song yeah\n12:33\nMost niggas like ya and then Buffalo\n12:35\nComes you can barely hear what I'm\n12:36\nSaying\n12:37\nThen Pilate coming this this 80s music\n12:39\nSo they're out cuz they want rap their\n12:41\nRun comes due they don't know and then\n12:44\nFind your wings coming it's like okay\n12:45\nThis is chill then cherry bomb just\n12:47\nPunches them so they're out and a lot of\n12:50\nPeople didn't know how to take it so\n12:51\nWell like I felt like and I don't even\n12:55\nMean lyrically I mean like sonically it\n12:58\nSounded more personal to you again going\n13:00\nBack to like your love of chords and\n13:01\nStuff like that and you were on Cherry\n13:03\nBomb like it seemed like you would have\n13:05\nQuite like distort it but it was like\n13:07\nYou always kind of running from it and\n13:09\nLike covering it up so that's saying\n13:11\nIt's your most personal album removed\n13:13\nFrom the subject matter it feels that\n13:14\nWay like yeah sonically get that yeah\n13:17\nYeah I never thought of that it just\n13:18\nFeels like a real okay so for the\n13:22\nSadness of forward that goes into like\n13:24\nAlmost the like I'm gonna say like\n13:27\nCockiness of where this flower blooms it\n13:30\nWas like do you feel like you were like\n13:32\nAccepting yourself like well like\n13:34\nSometimes I'm just like it's a lot of\n13:36\nThings that and I don't want to take\n13:37\nCare of but there's a lot of things that\n13:39\nI was doing and people were like what is\n13:41\nHe doing and then two years later it's\n13:43\nWhat everyone's doing whether it's the\n13:47\nWay videos are doing these stupid pop-up\n13:50\nShop things or whatever and I'm not\n13:51\nTaking credit but it's like I was doing\n13:53\nThat and no one ever puts me on any of\n13:55\nThese lists or even respects me in the\n13:57\nSense that I wanted so I was just and\n14:00\nThat's why that line is like ain't\n14:02\nNobody fucking with T yeah but that may\n14:04\nJust be my ego but but don't be too cool\n14:06\nBecause I may freeze and I'm stuck in\n14:10\nThis egotistical mind state and I never\n14:11\nMove forward yeah and that's how the\n14:13\nNiggas freeze to death but but then you\n14:15\nSure that weighs a ton your ice cause\n14:19\nIt's cold water your garden my niggas\n14:21\nStunt\n14:22\nI got a flower chain made like with all\n14:24\nThese different thing and that's what I\n14:25\nWas talking about but I was also like\n14:26\nYou know a fuck these niggas keep doing\n14:29\nMy shit\n14:30\nChinese black kids I could do with\n14:32\nThat's that's one of our favorite lyrics\n14:35\nIs just tell these black kids they could\n14:37\nBe who they are dude\n14:38\nLike it's one of my favorite you had\n14:40\nAnother cat you had another lyric like\n14:45\nThat on Cherry Bomb that was just like\n14:47\nThe world is yours a little like my\n14:50\nLittle nigga zero this you're like I\n14:51\nLove that I like is a similar thing tell\n14:54\nThese black kids they can be who they\n14:55\nAre dude were you saying it to you\n14:57\nYou're saying that to like the world I'm\n14:58\nSaying that you know saying that to meet\n15:00\nYou but like it's it's a it's no one\n15:04\nSaying that to these two kids that look\n15:08\nLike me or to anyone that looks like me\n15:10\nWe've had this conversation just wanting\n15:12\nThis snowboard when I was 12\n15:14\nThere's no one saying oh that's white\n15:15\nPeople shit black people don't do that\n15:17\nYeah no you don't do that don't put a\n15:20\nDamper on me and tell me what I can and\n15:23\nCan't be just because of the way\n15:25\nEveryone else was that's my same color\n15:28\nAnd I just feel like you are like good\n15:30\nTo tell them like no be you who you are\n15:32\nAs such the alternative to what\n15:36\nExpectations are placed on like a young\n15:39\nBlack guy growing up like it's always it\n15:42\nIt's you're influenced by kind of\n15:44\nEverything like just kind of like all\n15:46\nCulture and so do you think you accepted\n15:49\nThat about yourself through your music\n15:50\nOn the first oh I knew who I was at 12 I\n15:55\nThink you rapped maybe 28 percent of\n15:59\nAvailable it's like so I want it to my\n16:01\nGoal is I was to shut the fuck up and\n16:03\nLet all the features be the leaders yeah\n16:07\nYes Rex here sing for two minutes before\n16:10\nI come in with the a bar on boredom and\n16:12\nThen I'll have another a bar but I want\n16:14\nTo shut up and just let the string\n16:15\nSection be two minutes at the end\n16:17\nBoredom I think I this morning I was\n16:21\nLike boredom right now it to me is like\n16:23\nYou're Billie Jean really it really is\n16:26\nKind of a I seeing people connect with\n16:30\nThat so that song imput like I think I\n16:34\nCalled you and said I don't know if this\n16:36\nSong is creating an emotion for me or if\n16:39\nIt's like the soundtrack to something\n16:41\nAlready feel like that's how powerful I\n16:43\nThink\n16:45\nI wrote that literally it was a 5 p.m\n16:47\nOn a Saturday laying on my back looking\n16:50\nLike so bored it was nothing to do\n16:53\nNormos hit me back\n16:54\nJasper was in the other room bored out\n16:56\nOf his mind but I didn't see him all day\n16:58\nMy room was warm as hell because I like\n17:01\nThe heater on and it was nothing to eat\n17:02\nBut dry cereal mhm and I'm just sitting\n17:05\nThere like what the fuck am I gonna do\n17:07\nIt's and I literally wrote that verse in\n17:09\nLike 10 seconds cuz again it was these\n17:12\nQuestions and he's legit feelings of\n17:14\nBoredom that I was having and it was it\n17:17\nWas weird to me because it's like I'm in\n17:19\nA tax bracket where I could kind of go\n17:21\nYou doing me do whatever I have all\n17:23\nThese cards I could go drive you know I\n17:25\nHave I have nowhere to go and I'm just\n17:27\nBored and it was it was just confusing\n17:29\nTo me because it's like you don't\n17:31\nUnderstand how you could pass hell when\n17:33\nI be bored with it but it was nothing\n17:35\nInteresting to do at the moment which\n17:37\nWas crazy so I was like fuckin I'm gonna\n17:39\nWrite a song about it\n17:40\nAnd I was loving song I think I was\n17:43\nRight there I wrote this song over the\n17:45\nChords of God blessed the child by\n17:48\nStevie Wonder I figured out the chords\n17:50\nLooped it and just had it playing for\n17:52\nHours in my room and I wrote the verse\n17:54\nWhich was a 30 which was like a 40 bar\n17:57\nVerse originally but I cut it in half\n18:00\nBecause I was like the hook needs to\n18:01\nCome back so at the end of the first\n18:03\nVerse it's like I'm bored I did that\n18:08\nRight when he's editing because it went\n18:09\nTo the rest of the verse who was like\n18:11\nOriginally I'm bored and getting\n18:13\nDesperate phone is not even went\n18:14\nStraight to a different verse Oh\n18:16\nDifferent pockets like edit because I\n18:18\nWas like I need to put the hood back in\n18:20\nHere because I don't want to hear myself\n18:21\nBecause it's a weird chunk of our boy\n18:23\nBut right when we lose editing finishing\n18:27\nI was like no no fuck that put the hood\n18:29\nImma change the second verse yeah a\n18:31\nLittle bit in like so the pocket is\n18:33\nEasier to rap so everyone could say it\n18:35\nCuz it was too rapid II and I was like\n18:37\nI'm gonna hear this deep bass voice rap\n18:39\nFor that long let me shut the fuck up\n18:40\nAnd do a hood so all the white girls at\n18:42\nCoachella kiss ha ha ha ha ha ha and I'm\n18:44\nNot lying\n18:45\nDoing festivals you realize white people\n18:48\nLove singing along this shit yeah that's\n18:50\nWhy the fucking boredom is tomato\n18:52\nJustice like sway hey you when you\n18:56\nWhen you performing this on live you\n18:59\nStart on where this flower blooms\n19:00\nUsually and it's like is it a longer\n19:03\nIntro yeah yeah so when it's album I\n19:07\nWanted this I'm gonna sound like a\n19:08\nDisney score just like very magical my\n19:13\nPerfect little indie movie and fucking I\n19:17\nDon't like the album cover look yes I\n19:19\nWant the helmet cover looks like but it\n19:21\nTurned into you know when it turned into\n19:23\nBut when it's flower blooms I will have\n19:26\nThis really beautiful longer in short in\n19:28\nA bit but it sounds like the beginning\n19:31\nOf a sweeping and I start to shows with\n19:34\nThat because it's like bringing them\n19:37\nInto my world and then it drops it gets\n19:39\nCrazy but yeah wait and wait how long\n19:42\nDid you why did you trim it and not just\n19:44\nLet go it just by just wanted to cut the\n19:46\nFat\n19:47\nI wanted this album to be no longer than\n19:49\n45 minutes and I think we hit like 45\n19:54\nAnd 36 seconds or 46 minutes and I was\n19:58\nLike okay cool as short as possible on\n20:00\nIt to be short and get to the point yeah\n20:02\nUm you were saying uh like talking about\n20:05\nQuestions and every song is sparked by a\n20:08\nThing one of my faith it's my favorite\n20:12\nSequence of this but of these songs but\n20:16\nPothole is inspired by something your\n20:18\nMom said to you yeah yeah is that like\n20:21\nThat was a long time ago she was just\n20:23\nLike yo some some people just aren't\n20:27\nReally as lawyer or close to you as you\n20:33\nThink and I'm always like shut the fuck\n20:34\nUp like good to fuck you talking about\n20:36\nYeah sometimes moms know best and I've\n20:39\nHad to find out on my own like oh wow\n20:41\nLike your she was wrong about that\n20:45\nPerson\n20:46\nMm-hmm and I kind of wrote that verse\n20:48\nLike my mom told me blah blah blah blah\n20:50\nBlah and you just are just saying that\n20:54\nMore you started saying yeah and I even\n20:56\nEven just like and I and I did in the\n20:58\nCar like I drove back to the points\n21:00\nWhere she told me specifically like when\n21:04\nYou make three less it makes it right so\n21:06\nI yeah your life trying to double back\n21:09\nAnd the streets are filled with clues\n21:11\nThere's a great old me which by the\n21:13\nHawaiian realities that that's some of\n21:15\nYour best right I sense other familiars\n21:17\nI see some people I knew stuck in the\n21:19\nKota sac I pull up get out what up I'm\n21:21\nGonna help you but what you want for\n21:22\nSome people they don't want for\n21:24\nThemselves\n21:24\nJust leave them so do I stay here and\n21:26\nTry to figure it out or do I go and\n21:29\nTraffic is picking up and if I don't\n21:32\nLeave now and get on my path dude I need\n21:35\nTo do I'm gonna be stuck and five years\n21:38\nFrom now Tyler the Creator doesn't exist\n21:40\nSo it's either I stay here or I'll just\n21:42\nSay fucking and focus on what I gotta do\n21:44\nSo I speed off and I'm doing what I'm\n21:47\nDoing and I just metaphorically you want\n21:50\nNiggas to know like yo I'm still here\n21:53\nWhat power and my vehicle if you ever\n21:55\nNeed to jump or help or anything and but\n21:57\nI have to switch gears on them is there\n21:59\nI'm basically saying a damn verse blue\n22:02\nYeah no no no I mean it it's definitely\n22:05\nIt you can tell you are speaking to an\n22:08\nExperience or some experience and just\n22:10\nRealizing some not even in a negative\n22:13\nWay but some people are things are\n22:14\nPotholes and after too many potholes\n22:16\nYou're not gonna be able to get anywhere\n22:18\nCuz it just fucked the tire and the\n22:19\nWheel alignment and things up like that\n22:20\nAnd situations people certain things can\n22:23\nBe potholes to get to your end you're in\n22:26\nDestination and you just gotta watch out\n22:28\nAnd that's what my mother would always\n22:29\nTell me and I didn't believe her until I\n22:32\nHad to experience it on long Oh\n22:34\nWhen Jayden came at what point and Jane\n22:37\nAnd I was like when I when I wrote the\n22:38\nHook I was like oh my god Jaden's voice\n22:40\nWould be perfect for the tone of this\n22:42\nIssue yeah and I just had him come\n22:44\nThrough and he did it and he was so\n22:46\nHyped and he knocked it out so quick and\n22:47\nI fucking love Jayden that's my boy in\n22:50\nYeah yeah that because that's also I was\n22:53\nGonna say I mean I think lyrically one\n22:56\nOf your bet like you just seem to be in\n22:58\nA real zone right there did you record\n23:00\nThat in the album like was that uh that\n23:03\nWas the earliest song Loki for the how\n23:05\nLong I had that like September 2015 was\n23:09\nYour intention to rap more on the album\n23:11\nDidn't you do no I wanted to rap less\n23:13\nBut I end up wrapping some more because\n23:15\nThe versus Justin gonna be is so good\n23:17\nAnd then at the end of pothole it's this\n23:20\nGuy named Alex from wild high club\n23:22\nThis is bad I love my skip-tracing my\n23:25\nFavorite album last year yeah they put\n23:27\nOut in my favorite song number 10 Chapel\n23:30\nPerilous off skip-tracing is my fucking\n23:33\nThat song is such I can't wait to like\n23:36\nNew not die and I see a movie of my life\n23:39\nAnd it doesn't play such an important\n23:41\nPart but yeah yeah potholes yeah wha\n23:49\nDid you the song was complete then you\n23:52\nAdded just the snow that was in the my\n23:56\nWhen I first made the beat or whatever\n23:58\nIt was these chords I didn't use or\n24:01\nAnything but I just recorded them real\n24:02\nQuick just in the section in the session\n24:05\nAnd I just sang over real quick like it\n24:08\nWas like a melody I was fucking when I\n24:09\nLeft it at the end but when we were done\n24:11\nWith this song I was like oh I forgot\n24:12\nThat was there fuck it leave it at the\n24:14\nEnd and that's what that is\n24:16\nBecause what's crazy about it because of\n24:18\nThat piece and it goes into garden show\n24:21\nAnd I when I first heard it I I couldn't\n24:23\nTell I couldn't differentiate like the\n24:26\nSongs I just kind of flowed seamlessly\n24:29\nInto it and I I wasn't sure what because\n24:31\nAlso the way garden shed is structured\n24:33\nIs it's like three different emotions\n24:36\nLike that you go through it's like you\n24:38\nGo through in a whole emotional arc\n24:40\nBefore ever\n24:41\nSpeaking on the record what mood were\n24:44\nYou going for like what was I remember\n24:46\nMaking that I had those chords on piano\n24:49\nAnd I was like it's not hitting so I\n24:51\nAustin I'm so hollow is coming just play\n24:54\nWe play the get the chords on the guitar\n24:55\nAnd I had it looped it was just there\n24:59\nWent to sleep woke up early the next\n25:01\nMorning played it and literally just was\n25:04\nLike let me at the most simple drums did\n25:07\nThat was like added a quick synth\n25:09\nThere's like want to take a turn\n25:13\nYeah hits and then go back to being the\n25:14\nPrettiest thing ever yeah and I was like\n25:16\nFuck her she went see and I was like oh\n25:18\nMy god I think this is the most\n25:21\nBeautiful thing I've ever done and it\n25:23\nTook a year to write the singing parts\n25:27\nAnd figure it out there was so many\n25:29\nOther melodies and I was like wait this\n25:31\nIs supposed to\n25:32\nI have much mm-hmm so when I wrote the\n25:35\nParts figured it out I was like Estelle\n25:38\nWould be great\n25:40\nYep with her accent and just her tone\n25:43\nSorry gonna tournament I'm gonna turn\n25:46\nAnd I was like my voice can't do it my\n25:48\nRecipe but she came and she figured out\n25:51\nHe's a professional and it was it was\n25:53\nReally fun doing that work and for the\n25:56\nVerse I was like let me rap double time\n25:58\nBecause in its three it's three one two\n26:01\nThree so it's we're kind I was like fuck\n26:02\nIt I'm gonna make sure my pocket is just\n26:04\nCrazy just like jumping all over the\n26:07\nPlace just to give it a new feel from\n26:10\nThe first half that effect on even just\n26:13\nSaying garbage because the way you say\n26:16\nIt and it's like so I've always kind of\n26:20\nHated my voice mmm so like my stuff from\n26:23\nLike 2008 I will pitch it up in 2009-10\n26:26\nI will put you down\n26:27\nMm-hmm cuz I just hated it so around\n26:30\nThis time I was like let me give myself\n26:31\nA fake accent I don't know what it is\n26:33\nBut let me start pronouncing shit dear\n26:35\nSo garnish I go to Chicago for the\n26:38\nBottle but like bored and getting this\n26:40\nThrough this hell said like I wanted to\n26:42\nDo that cuz I was like I hate my voice\n26:44\nLet me make it interesting for myself it\n26:46\nWas oh I ain't got time mm-hm\n26:50\nYou got time I'm just like man that song\n26:57\nIs so busy and so crazy I don't need to\n27:00\nMatch that let me be super chill about\n27:02\nIt and just like Barney the Kleenex how\n27:05\nI got this fun let me just be smooth and\n27:08\nCool on that motherfucker I think that\n27:09\nTime sounds like it sounds like it and I\n27:13\nPutting earrings in a person about the\n27:15\nFight yes yes that's what I want I\n27:18\nWanted that intro to be like oh shit oh\n27:21\nWe should leave yes I when he drives a\n27:24\nSlight and it's almost like Latin about\n27:25\nLike that beginning yeah so that's a\n27:29\nSample from my mind won't blink but I\n27:32\nHad looted and originally that wasn't it\n27:35\nSo I originally made I ain't got time\n27:38\nLife of Pablo sessions in a studio\n27:40\nMm-hmm but in Konya get on it that just\n27:43\nSeems like a Michael but I thought I'll\n27:45\nBeat I ain't got time for these need you\n27:48\nHad you it was just my hand touch it was\n27:51\nAttempted intent and that was a whole\n27:54\nSeparate beat so then I was like fuck is\n27:57\nSomething here something cool about that\n27:58\nI got time hook which I was bad I hooked\n28:02\nSo when I had that hook I was like man I\n28:04\nFinally did something great\n28:05\nYeah so I kind of mesh these two beats\n28:07\nTogether and it was a different beat I\n28:09\nHad with the turn thinner that put it\n28:11\nTogether like okay I got a hook I had my\n28:15\nFirst verse so I need a clean mix happy\n28:16\nBirthday\n28:17\nYou bitch the hook and I was like man on\n28:20\nThe second verse I know yeah is not\n28:22\nDoesn't like this song so Nicki Minaj's\n28:25\nVoice will be fucking perfect for this\n28:28\nYeah\n28:28\nWe sent it to her she's like horribles\n28:31\nWill swill hear that weird out mic a\n28:34\nMonth later it was like she couldn't\n28:35\nCome up with that damn this don't evoke\n28:37\nNothing maybe I'm just trash I was like\n28:41\nFuck it so I wrote this they said it was\n28:43\nA hook yeah all that not nothing having\n28:46\nSaw just like alright let me add a\n28:48\nSecond verse and I was like that turn it\n28:50\nWould be so proud of me and when I was\n28:51\nYounger and that turner was so cool to\n28:53\nMe because he rebelled against all that\n28:55\nShit so why the motherfuckers what I\n28:58\nDidn't want to say that all these white\n29:00\nBoys got they stopped for me and so I\n29:01\nJust wanted to sound like mother fuck\n29:03\nLike you want to be emotional I wanted\n29:05\nThe emotional turn or something\n29:08\nSomething that Turner talks the way but\n29:10\nYou a house nigga so you don't know him\n29:12\nI should go a rough one with my big lips\n29:14\nAnd my big nose in my short head cuz you\n29:17\nKnow I already know how slow my shit\n29:18\nGrow and you switch and then I said I\n29:20\nWant that fucking beat to just go but\n29:24\nJust weird just sound like pink fucking\n29:28\nGooge's garnet it almost sounded it not\n29:32\nThis but almost like chopping screw type\n29:34\nOf you know to me because you could feel\n29:36\nThe turning to get slow and I was like\n29:40\nI'm a bar out I really want to bar out\n29:43\nLike how Wayne used to make us feel like\n29:47\nOh six oh seven mixtapes

I\n36:17\nMean I was like I'm getting Wayne on\n36:20\nThis I was like I'm getting Wayne on\n36:23\nThis I only want 16 bars maybe eight\n36:26\nBut Wayne has to discover this once why\n36:29\nThe decision for you not to join cuz I\n36:31\nWas like I was like no I just have a\n36:33\nLittle hook at the end mm-hmm but I want\n36:36\nTo hear Wayne over these notes and up\n36:40\nThis pocket and I want to see what he\n36:42\nWould do and his high-pitched voice over\n36:44\nThis lower tone of like this this weird\n36:47\nBrian Bennett like lounge library music\n36:50\nI made I want Wayne over that because I\n36:54\nMean after a while hearing hearing\n36:56\nWeighing over some like a toe weights\n36:58\nAnd some shit like that it's like cool\n37:00\nWell he becomes really cool like it's so\n37:05\nNo album was supposed to be about\n37:06\nFlowers and garnet yeah what did you\n37:09\nTell him the whole I was supposed to be\n37:10\nAbout every song supposed to be about\n37:11\nFlowers and garden is so supposed\n37:13\nSupposed to sound like a score but it\n37:15\nEnded up changing and this was one of\n37:17\nThe first songs finished like pothole\n37:18\nAnd drop a seed and I was like yo just\n37:21\nWipe about flowers and garden trees\n37:24\nWhatever and I was on tour for Cherry\n37:27\nBomb in Omaha Nebraska mm-hmm and I got\n37:29\nA text from him like check your

versions\n38:10\nLonger but yeah how long did you make it\n38:13\nLike initially and why and why I wanted\n38:16\nIt simply short just as just one of\n38:19\nThose just inner lose that\n38:20\nKeep on in a replay but that's um that's\n38:24\nLike the music that plays in my head\n38:28\nJust daydreaming just those chords just\n38:30\nLike in my dream world\n38:33\nIt's chords I just play in the air\n38:36\nMm-hmm like 20 that's all my dream\n38:38\nPlanet that's what it is but that's\n38:41\nLiterally just my daydream just music\n38:44\nJust notes and that's what it is no\n38:47\nDrums just melody and then that's when\n38:50\nThey'll shake power and then shame\n38:52\nPowers voice which fits really perfect\n38:55\nReally well with the juxtaposition\n38:58\nConferences you want to be super fuck it\n38:59\nWhat is so aggressive goes in to see you\n39:02\nAgain with the humans in my dream state\n39:04\nYeah I mean that's cuz that's my that's\n39:07\nMy daydream music sometimes yeah

on in square\n45:23\nCircle or anything from 87 88 that weird\n45:27\nTime could be a crime I could be awful\n45:29\nBut it just sounds like an updated\n45:32\nStevie Wonder song if Timberlake or\n45:35\nSomeone was gonna sing over reality just\n45:42\nKeeps on just going there it's perfect\n45:45\nAnd dant done turn turn turn turn\n45:48\nLike yeah I'm just like is that

the ending of - hi wait just\n46:03\nBecause the the tempo kind of slows down\n46:05\nJust like it's it's one of the greatest\n46:09\nLike just slow down the it lands like a\n46:11\nReef so when your love is looking for\n46:17\nAnother pure love crazy looking for\n46:18\nAnother pure love is the weirdest temple\n46:22\nLike it's like think about that temple\n46:24\nOf just like yeah yeah like so

then\n47:04\nGoing in and golden lady we're seven\n47:06\nWeird I mean what it was odd it looks\n47:10\nLike that same concert you come up if\n47:17\nYou really love me he splits it up\n47:21\nThere's a woman in that shot that looks\n47:23\nLike my mom it's already low the thing\n47:27\nAnd then there's this a woman in a shot\n47:28\nThat looks like my mom and and I just\n47:30\nWatch it and almost crying she's crazy\n47:33\nUm wait wait wait a because the Stevie\n47:39\nI'm blanking on it was a it was another\n47:42\nQuestion off of something you said but\n47:43\nOkay that so that's you and Pharrell\n47:47\nWettest faretta Pharrell just comes in\n47:49\nWith vocals on the thing yeah I just\n47:50\nSeems like can I use these ovo cuz he's\n47:52\nLike yeah and I was just like let me\n47:54\nJust have it at the end and that that's\n47:57\nThis shit that makes five-year-old me\n47:58\nMale that's when I was five the notes\n48:01\nAnd I didn't know what chords were what\n48:03\nAnything was but I was always saying it\n48:05\nGoes down and you know it slants it's\n48:07\nSlang I played a song for you by Stevie\n48:11\nWonder and take six why I feel this way\n48:15\nAnd I remember you were like almost\n48:17\nCorrect like you made me turn it off and\n48:19\nYou're like in a fetal position a key\n48:20\nCause of all I know that I don't know\n48:22\nWhat the fuck those notes do to me ever\n48:24\nSince I remember being seven mm-hmm and\n48:27\nWhen it will rain I will put on either\n48:29\nUh number three from love deluxe

cry\n48:42\nBecause the chords would just do\n48:44\nSomething to me and I don't know what it\n48:46\nIs I can't explain that whole when I die\n48:48\nThis gets explained to me but they do\n48:50\nSomething to me and I've it's almost\n48:51\nLike a dog whistle for like dogs if it\n48:54\nCauses\n48:55\nI think we have a lot of similar quote\n48:58\nBecause we've talked about like

you\n51:04\nGet that like you were talking about the\n51:05\nOh I know I was gonna say\n51:07\nJose Feliciano also did like my fire and\n51:10\nIt was is this one guitar kind of think\n51:13\nRiff that he does that I just want to\n51:15\nLoop over and over also like what do you\n51:19\nPlan piano room that I loop a wild wolf\n51:22\nWolf would you ensure the course of wolf\n51:24\nAre perfect night like I was this video\n51:27\nOf just you doing the over and over\n51:30\nBecause it's just as beautiful that's my\n51:32\nFather always like that even in Yonkers\n51:34\nLike the second verse is just some piano\n51:35\nChords that comes yeah few seconds and\n51:37\nI'm like like I had I have another\n51:40\nVersion of that word that just loosed I\n51:41\nWanna talk about the what kind of the\n51:44\nOpposite of these beautiful chord in\n51:46\nMotion November is like one of the\n51:48\nHeaviest songs right and it's you're\n51:53\nLike paranoid is that is that the theme\n51:55\nWould you say this so that was the thing\n51:56\nThat was a last song for the album that\n51:59\nYou record it yeah literally and it was\n52:04\nJust me thinking just literally yeah\n52:06\nMade me be like what is are you a nancy\n52:10\nOver what if when I put who that boy out\n52:13\nNo one cares what if I'm hustling\n52:15\nBackwards what if my accountant is\n52:17\nStealing money from me and I don't know\n52:18\nIt yeah just everything that could be\n52:20\nThe worst thing that could happen to me\n52:22\nAt that moment I was just like what is I\n52:25\nRemember talking to Clancy right after\n52:27\nAnd he was just like yeah I'm he has a\n52:29\nLove/hate with me on the sidewalk but\n52:30\nThe pothole is like only trust me about\n52:33\nNovember's just like this motherfuckers\n52:35\nStealing his would be this whole like\n52:39\nBut is it was it just you it seemed like\n52:42\nA journal entry yeah in November of 2016\n52:47\nWas probably the greatest time of my\n52:49\nLife why we have rented a house out\n52:52\nEvery morning we will wake up right for\n52:55\nThe jelly's mm-hmm\n52:56\nI was starting to get involved with\n52:58\nCommerce\n53:00\nAfter I was done we would spend time at\n53:05\nLeast me and Jasper playing the game I\n53:07\nWent bought the VRS stupid PlayStation\n53:09\nWe had the new Mario switch when we were\n53:13\nDone working why it will come out and go\n53:15\nTo the park or just like go bike riding\n53:16\nOr just whatever go to shows and then I\n53:19\nWill go to studio and I'll be working on\n53:21\nThe album\n53:21\nSome of us show November and then a\n53:24\nPerson it it could like it could be a\n53:28\nPerson it could be a song it could be a\n53:30\nTime but just those things that just\n53:32\nMake you super happy and it's kind of\n53:35\nLike the totem in Inception yeah yeah\n53:38\nLiterally in the house we had on call\n53:40\nWater was just an amazing time yeah and\n53:45\nI was literally wearing Hawaiian shirts\n53:48\nIn January\n53:49\nIt means cold that was the mindset you\n53:54\nWere in yeah it was sir it was fucking\n53:57\nGreat dude it was so goddamn good yeah\n54:00\nI'm but it's funny how if you would have\n54:03\nEnded the album with November how it\n54:05\nWould change people will be like yo give\n54:08\nThis yo are you okay oh yeah no people\n54:10\nYou okay very concerned about well

break was the gas what if I crash\n54:26\nYes these deep thoughts is my last let\n54:29\nMe pull over quick yeah that's when I\n54:31\nMake the phone call for glitter which is\n54:33\nJust a voicemail or whatever he he but\n54:37\nAll yeah it all ties in it why flowers\n54:40\nI never asked you like what what was\n54:43\nLike the symbolism behind you they're\n54:45\nBeautiful\n54:46\nYou just nature like handy and I thought\n54:49\nIt would be cool yeah and that cover\n54:51\nBeing gold an hour\n54:52\nFor the past few months every go to now\n54:54\nOur listen a night and day buy\n54:56\nEverything but the girl mm-hmm and\n54:57\nTracey thorn is the singer who sings\n55:00\nFrom everything but the girl they have a\n55:01\nLot of great songs and the first part of\n55:04\nNovember is me singing I wrote that\n55:11\nMorning Tracy dorna go there but I'd\n55:14\nNever asked because for that specific\n55:17\nPart I already got rejected by Rick Ross\n55:19\nI wanted to a bar from him there so this\n55:22\nVoice it's such a heavy voice the tone\n55:25\nOf his laser over that been perfect yeah\n55:27\nIt kind of didn't work out and I was\n55:30\nLike whatever so I just put that ref\n55:31\nThere for Tracey thorn but I never went\n55:35\nThrough with it because I just was like\n55:36\nI just want to finish this album I'm\n55:38\nOver it\n55:40\nI feel defeated fuck it I'll just leave\n55:42\nMy voice there and that's and that's\n55:44\nWhat that is\n55:44\nAnd I want it I want to play boy cardi\n55:46\nOh on November 1 upon where I'm like\n55:50\nTake me back take me back yeah I think\n55:53\nThat I think his voice is like a go-kart\n55:56\nBut I knew your army Lee rock like the\n55:59\nHandling chauffeurs son\n56:01\nMm I thought this is not pop this rock\n56:03\nListen up and I think it's so sick yeah\n56:05\nSo that part in November was a take me\n56:09\nBack I was gonna get played with car do\n56:10\nYou do it that would have been Rick Ross\n56:12\nYou playboy card entries or just would\n56:18\nYeah great he came out great and it's\n56:24\nCrazy a lot of these songs on this album\n56:25\nIs just songs that people didn't take\n56:29\nYou know I think because it came out and\n56:31\nIt works I could now maybe be like hey\n56:35\nPop artists\n56:36\nI just want to produce more hey I could\n56:39\nWrite a cool little melody like let's do\n56:41\nIt hopefully no one's called yet but I\n56:44\nMean but you want to do that you want to\n56:46\nJust like all I want to do like if I\n56:48\nHave that I could be successful in that\n56:49\nCuz you always talked about wanting to\n56:51\nScore things you talked about this or\n56:53\nSome your score or a few things and just\n56:56\nProduce songs I don't I don't have to\n56:59\nWrap it all and make clothes and just\n57:01\nCreate other shit but I don't but it's\n57:05\nFun it's fun like it but I mean I gotta\n57:07\nSay that I mean I'll go fucking put a\n57:09\nVerse on something cuz it's still fun\n57:10\nYeah but but it's not even just about\n57:13\nIt's more feeling you don't you almost\n57:15\nCreate music like a director you know\n57:17\nIt's all it's about the encompassing\n57:20\nFeeling\n57:21\nEverything you know what I mean so it's\n57:23\nLike like again like garden shed is like\n57:25\nIt's just an emotion that then you wrap\n57:27\nOn when it suits the emotion like guard\n57:30\nSure sounds like the indie movies I like\n57:32\nYeah then who that boy sounds like\n57:35\nHorror I was just a goddamn score yeah\n57:39\nYou know somebody gotta give me a\n57:41\nGoddamn chance the 70 year old white\n57:44\nDude still do it like cool well I mean\n57:47\nYou have such an amazing here and you\n57:51\nKnow I'm very thankful that you make\n57:53\nMusic thank you really I really thankful\n57:57\nYou make music it's genuinely beautiful\n57:59\nAnd you know I think it's\n58:04\n58:10", "image":

to\n00:09\nAsk you after listening to it is are you\n00:11\nOkay\n00:12\nLike there's something wrong like like\n00:15\nIt's like gut-wrenching it's both\n00:18\nBeautiful it's very beautiful but it's\n00:20\nLike parts that hurt a little bit you\n00:23\nKnow yeah it's man I was like cuz for\n00:27\nCherry Bomb purposes like I don't want\n00:29\nTo get personal at all like I might just\n00:31\nMake songs yeah it's just all just this\n00:34\nIs a song and in this and I was like\n00:35\nAlright let me write down every feeling\n00:38\nI started emotions just just a lot of\n00:42\nThem was just asking questions a lot of\n00:44\nThe song just have questioning is just\n00:45\nLike how am I feeling today mmm-hmm fuck\n00:48\nWhat if I go poor again what if the\n00:49\nDoesn't work and then that's how a lot\n00:51\nOf the song has happened just me kind of\n00:53\nJust asking these core answering these\n00:55\nQuestions like so but I speaking to like\n00:58\nA move you were in like like you\n01:01\nRecorded this one when did you but\n01:03\nMostly mm see like I started to indie\n01:06\n2015 a lot of spring/summer 2016 and in\n01:09\nA lot of fall what were you listening to\n01:12\nLike um like watching and let's hop\n01:14\nMusic I was like listening that\n01:17\nStructure I kinda just what like Max\n01:21\nMartin was doing and really getting into\n01:24\nWhat what Pharrell and Justin was doing\n01:27\nYeah and just noticing just hook I\n01:31\nHanging out with Travis taco Hey I went\n01:34\nTo club with him and just seeing what\n01:36\nPeople how people reacted didn't ever go\n01:39\nTo the clubs I hate them you know I go\n01:41\nTo club when I would go I would just\n01:43\nStudy oh that that bass drop or all that\n01:46\nGirl loves that part just like okay I\n01:48\nWant to have a song that has that\n01:51\nFeeling you know I kind of was like okay\n01:53\nI want to see challenge myself and try\n01:55\nTo make a few song that's not like a\n01:58\nRabbit-ear appier super distorted I was\n02:01\nLike last night I went to me Lionel into\n02:04\nLike a house party and they they all the\n02:06\nSong they were playing seniorita by\n02:08\nJustin tell me by total front and by\n02:11\nPeople I call these house parties\n02:13\nAnd see you again came on and it's full\n02:16\nOf black people yeah for sure go to\n02:18\nClubs yeah and they were in there like\n02:20\nSinging the lyrics and I was like oh\n02:21\nShit I've always wanted that so just\n02:24\nHave black people ID dance yeah yeah so\n02:27\nYou're so hyped and I was we were\n02:29\nPlaying Jenga and I was being cool about\n02:30\nIt but inside I was like oh she's going\n02:32\nCrazy finally have something that they\n02:35\nCould do that to you it's funny because\n02:37\nI guess I wouldn't have like thought\n02:39\nAbout how much like pop is you know\n02:42\nInfluenced in the album because because\n02:45\nOf like the subject matter like a lot of\n02:48\nIt is so heavy that's why I was just\n02:50\nWondering where you were in like a place\n02:51\nOf just like hey you gotta feed you put\n02:54\nThe over here so you put the medicine in\n02:57\nLike the so like mr. lonely I was like\n03:02\nOh dude I want to write the saddest song\n03:04\nI could possibly write and see people go\n03:06\nCrazy and like dance to it yeah it's\n03:09\nThat and not the shows that show that\n03:10\nSong is insane and it's the saddest song\n03:12\nI've ever wrote yeah it really and you\n03:15\nDance I mean it's so hard it's so hard\n03:18\nAnd like the greatest like bridge what\n03:22\nWas that what was that I don't know if\n03:23\nWe I mean I'm just gonna kind of jump\n03:25\nInto various songs but like what what\n03:27\nWas like specifically that like trip why\n03:31\nThat transition like why did you think\n03:33\nThat was like needed a transit like was\n03:36\nIt like it for emotional like were you\n03:38\nTrying to create snow\n03:39\nNine-one-one a mr. lonely originally was\n03:44\nDifferent song kind of together it was\n03:46\nThis jazz take a hat that was super\n03:48\nTriumphal even just sounded grand and a\n03:51\nLot of those lyrics was uh was in that\n03:55\nSong and I just took him and just place\n03:58\nThem on nine one one and then took the\n04:01\nVerse and placed it on mr. lonely and\n04:03\nAdded some stuff and nine-one-one the\n04:06\nSong the version I came out is the 25th\n04:08\nVersion in waves for the twenty fifth\n04:10\nTwenty fifty five of those twenty four\n04:13\nThe first version was over a interlude\n04:15\nSong that Tony Toni ton\u00e9 had i looped it\n04:19\nSang over that like the hook that I put\n04:21\nThere made 30 beats for it it's in the\n04:24\nVersions are just different\n04:26\nType of lyrics it's literally like\n04:29\nDifferent beads different melodies\n04:31\nDifferent about mate that took the beat\n04:33\nFrom the fashion show I did\n04:34\nWe worked at took the lyrics from the\n04:37\nOriginal mr. lonely and like\n04:39\nImplementing it in that and like so the\n04:42\nOriginal mr. lonely it's like a five car\n04:45\nGarage for ten good guys some coffee for\n04:49\nEvery day of the week and it go really\n04:51\nFast but it means nothing nothing\n04:54\nNothing without you shotgun yeah right\n04:58\nYeah that's in the last version I want\n05:01\nFive car garage full tank of gas but\n05:03\nThat'll mean nothing not so you kept\n05:05\nThat baseball bat excitedly jazz on me\n05:09\nYeah now I want I want them to groove to\n05:12\nThis shit so I'll put it on there I\n05:13\nActually always wondered why bat nothing\n05:15\nLike why bad repeat well yeah it just\n05:17\nCuz it was from it was it was probably\n05:19\nThe bass to the other one but when I put\n05:21\nIt there and drop the B people I was\n05:23\nLike oh people are gonna love saying\n05:24\nThis and if you see that shows I don't\n05:26\nEven say it I just put the mic in no and\n05:31\nI'm like I figured it out and then I get\n05:34\nOut the that with that feeling that you\n05:37\nFeeling of just everybody really\n05:39\nConnected with it but don't wait\n05:40\nSpecifically the bridge on that like\n05:43\nWell wait the church air part yeah well\n05:46\nThen I guess a brick but like what like\n05:48\nWhich is the most one of the most\n05:50\nAddictive I ain't made that I remember I\n05:54\nMade that bridge and he was just the\n05:55\nBeat and I remember stopping like I made\n05:58\nThe bridge that I've always wanted to\n06:01\nMake Lonnie came by our Frank however\n06:03\nPeople uh and he came by and I played it\n06:06\nFor him he's like you let me go in there\n06:07\nJust try something\n06:08\nHe just started making phone noises and\n06:10\nIt worked out so perfectly and alright\n06:14\nAnd we kept it was it longer no okay no\n06:17\nThat part I'm just giving it as eight\n06:19\nBars of these chords just so they could\n06:21\nWant it yeah when I replay it and that's\n06:24\nIt at that that's okay so how did you\n06:26\nBalance out and this is kind of for the\n06:28\nWhole album your love of chords with you\n06:32\nAlways talk about and you always say\n06:34\nNiggas don't want courts they don't and\n06:37\nThat's everything that you that's all\n06:38\nYou're obsessed\n06:40\nI was just everything is specific I just\n06:42\nWant chords and melodies yeah and was it\n06:45\nLike a was it like a battle for cuz the\n06:47\nWhole album has chords yeah well I\n06:49\nFucked up I don't fuck up but cherry\n06:51\nBond was hard to get into cuz it was a\n06:53\nWhole album of bridges and shit going\n06:55\nEverywhere so I was like okay let me for\n06:58\nThis album specifically add all the\n07:00\nChords I like but do it in a way they\n07:02\nCould not Jess\n07:03\nSo mr. lonely has some of the prettiest\n07:05\nChords or the album yeah\n07:07\nBut I kind of hid it behind the hard\n07:09\nDrums and the fast pace rap but if you\n07:12\nReally listen it's really fuckin pretty\n07:15\nAnd I was like thank you I was like I\n07:19\nWas like I'm definitely gonna just try\n07:22\nTo hide it in those and stuff and I\n07:24\nWon't want even the UH call me sometime\n07:26\nI wasn't in a gap man I was like damn\n07:28\nThese are simple chords and I love the\n07:30\nMelody let me try to implement it in\n07:31\nThis and make it as simple as possible\n07:34\nBut it still gives me that feeling so\n07:37\nThe part where I was like not fuckin I'm\n07:39\nGonna get crazy is right one Steve\n07:41\nLacey's parts over and it goes back to\n07:42\nThe hood and it's that done - done yeah\n07:44\nIt goes down yeah I was like I'm gonna\n07:46\nGo on my Jill Scott she but that's my\n07:48\nFavorite part of that song just cuz it\n07:50\nJust it has all the chords that you love\n07:52\nIt exactly oh do you wanna a weak Akane\n07:56\nOkay\n07:57\n08:02\nI can't even lie wait wait like what I\n08:07\nJust imagine a nigga and a wife beater\n08:12\nAnd like is he talking to his friends I\n08:16\nDon't know in the market too but it's a\n08:17\nQuick shot it I think about but I can't\n08:19\nEven live it lonely it's fun just being\n08:22\nHonest with his homies or something and\n08:24\nI was just like man I'll be really\n08:25\nVillainy to chant but it's the perfect\n08:28\nSetup for when that song like comes on\n08:30\nYeah and it sets you up for like what's\n08:33\nAbout to happen it's honest but it's\n08:36\nIt's right here and they go crazy but\n08:39\nIt's like so sad it's hilarious yeah\n08:41\nIt's like this there's a group in\n08:43\nBiggest and that's rocky that's rocky\n08:45\nJelena\n08:46\nOh that's rocky that's cute I think\n08:48\nThat's Wyatt that's Lionel that's Jasper\n08:51\nAll right forward is okay first of all\n08:59\nThat tempo was very weird it's like a\n09:03\nReally weird simple that you felt like\n09:05\nWas it just kind of like a what so\n09:06\nThat's a that's a loop from his band\n09:08\nCalled can and um I've always been in a\n09:12\nCroc rockets like it was a sound I was\n09:14\nLike very European Eastern Europe and\n09:17\nYou have like can you have the Silver\n09:19\nApples even even soft machine which was\n09:23\nThis really prog jazz band took like\n09:25\nInfluence around that time and it's kind\n09:26\nOf what portishead listens to the\n09:28\nInfluence and it's something I've always\n09:30\nLiked because it was just so weird and\n09:32\nJust these weird drum patterns and just\n09:34\nAll these haunting bass lines and that's\n09:37\nThat's the song that they had and every\n09:39\nTime I would play it I would just wrap\n09:40\nOver it and I was like you know fucking\n09:42\nI'm a loop 'add and is it hard to breath\n09:45\nOver that no not actually it's it's\n09:47\nActually just a one two three four but\n09:50\nSome buckets that they we use makes it\n09:53\nSound like this weird push-pull back\n09:56\nThing yes that's what it feels like it\n09:58\nLike your own something you don't mean\n10:00\nIt just kind of pulls like yeah yeah and\n10:02\nIt's like well because that pocket is\n10:04\nSuch a like the pace of it is a like\n10:08\nWhen you when you're rapping over it's\n10:10\nLike you do a little bit faster than I\n10:12\nWould\n10:12\nYou don't mean like it's like a little\n10:14\nBit more why why that song first why'd\n10:18\nThat move first up like I just were you\n10:21\nTrying to set up\n10:22\nI I don't know I just been making it\n10:24\nLike this needs to be the first song\n10:25\nJust going just so you can see where I'm\n10:27\nAt in my head and I'll remember writing\n10:30\nThat first fully just like I mean like\n10:35\nReally wondering like how much she\n10:38\nCannot buy until it gets boring like how\n10:42\nMany jumps could I do on a bike and so\n10:43\nI'm over it and I'm off to the next\n10:45\nThing know every answer that I kinda I\n10:48\nDon't know I went to the next question\n10:49\nLike it don't sell me or enough it was\n10:52\nSo existential and contemplatively\n10:54\nSounded suicidal especially like look\n10:56\nLike if I'm going and don't let you know\n10:58\nYou don't really got way that's that was\n11:01\nThe end question like damn what if he's\n11:03\nJust know what if I died what happens\n11:05\nYeah that's kind of what it was and it\n11:07\nJust to set the tone of like that's\n11:10\nWrong yeah is it it's not the print like\n11:13\nI'm not depressed at all and a lot of\n11:15\nPeople mix up depression with\n11:17\nSelf-awareness yeah and like like\n11:20\nSomeone's like do too Salinger person\n11:21\nLike no I never said I was depressed\n11:22\nI'm lonely but I'm having the most fun\n11:25\nOf my goddamn life yeah and but that\n11:27\nSong kind of sets like that tone but if\n11:30\nYou're okay I mean if you're not if if\n11:33\nYou're considering death right but it's\n11:35\nNot from a depressed like sad state is\n11:37\nIt from a place of like alright I got\n11:40\nSomething to prove cuz it almost seems\n11:42\nLike you had like a thing to prove with\n11:45\nThis with this album like just I don't\n11:47\nKnow to yourself or well you always a\n11:50\nLot of people do stuff for the\n11:52\nConversation of when they're dead\n11:54\nMmm-hmm like hopefully when I die people\n11:57\nWho could say oh he this this and this\n11:59\nGood stuff i I leave a good this Agra\n12:01\nFree behind but yeah I like to start\n12:03\nWith every project I like to start from\n12:06\nDeath and work that exactly it's just\n12:08\nLike we're all gonna die someday one I\n12:11\nJust I just knew if this album wasn't\n12:13\nGood I will be fucked that's how I felt\n12:17\nIt some people would disagree but I'm\n12:18\nLike man I'm not I'm nothing right now\n12:21\nYou felt that way coming off Cherry Bomb\n12:23\nYeah yeah cuz everyone hate it except\n12:25\nFor like\n12:26\nMusic laughing cares about drums like I\n12:29\nOpened a rap album with a rock song yeah\n12:33\nMost niggas like ya and then Buffalo\n12:35\nComes you can barely hear what I'm\n12:36\nSaying\n12:37\nThen Pilate coming this this 80s music\n12:39\nSo they're out cuz they want rap their\n12:41\nRun comes due they don't know and then\n12:44\nFind your wings coming it's like okay\n12:45\nThis is chill then cherry bomb just\n12:47\nPunches them so they're out and a lot of\n12:50\nPeople didn't know how to take it so\n12:51\nWell like I felt like and I don't even\n12:55\nMean lyrically I mean like sonically it\n12:58\nSounded more personal to you again going\n13:00\nBack to like your love of chords and\n13:01\nStuff like that and you were on Cherry\n13:03\nBomb like it seemed like you would have\n13:05\nQuite like distort it but it was like\n13:07\nYou always kind of running from it and\n13:09\nLike covering it up so that's saying\n13:11\nIt's your most personal album removed\n13:13\nFrom the subject matter it feels that\n13:14\nWay like yeah sonically get that yeah\n13:17\nYeah I never thought of that it just\n13:18\nFeels like a real okay so for the\n13:22\nSadness of forward that goes into like\n13:24\nAlmost the like I'm gonna say like\n13:27\nCockiness of where this flower blooms it\n13:30\nWas like do you feel like you were like\n13:32\nAccepting yourself like well like\n13:34\nSometimes I'm just like it's a lot of\n13:36\nThings that and I don't want to take\n13:37\nCare of but there's a lot of things that\n13:39\nI was doing and people were like what is\n13:41\nHe doing and then two years later it's\n13:43\nWhat everyone's doing whether it's the\n13:47\nWay videos are doing these stupid pop-up\n13:50\nShop things or whatever and I'm not\n13:51\nTaking credit but it's like I was doing\n13:53\nThat and no one ever puts me on any of\n13:55\nThese lists or even respects me in the\n13:57\nSense that I wanted so I was just and\n14:00\nThat's why that line is like ain't\n14:02\nNobody fucking with T yeah but that may\n14:04\nJust be my ego but but don't be too cool\n14:06\nBecause I may freeze and I'm stuck in\n14:10\nThis egotistical mind state and I never\n14:11\nMove forward yeah and that's how the\n14:13\nNiggas freeze to death but but then you\n14:15\nSure that weighs a ton your ice cause\n14:19\nIt's cold water your garden my niggas\n14:21\nStunt\n14:22\nI got a flower chain made like with all\n14:24\nThese different thing and that's what I\n14:25\nWas talking about but I was also like\n14:26\nYou know a fuck these niggas keep doing\n14:29\nMy shit\n14:30\nChinese black kids I could do with\n14:32\nThat's that's one of our favorite lyrics\n14:35\nIs just tell these black kids they could\n14:37\nBe who they are dude\n14:38\nLike it's one of my favorite you had\n14:40\nAnother cat you had another lyric like\n14:45\nThat on Cherry Bomb that was just like\n14:47\nThe world is yours a little like my\n14:50\nLittle nigga zero this you're like I\n14:51\nLove that I like is a similar thing tell\n14:54\nThese black kids they can be who they\n14:55\nAre dude were you saying it to you\n14:57\nYou're saying that to like the world I'm\n14:58\nSaying that you know saying that to meet\n15:00\nYou but like it's it's a it's no one\n15:04\nSaying that to these two kids that look\n15:08\nLike me or to anyone that looks like me\n15:10\nWe've had this conversation just wanting\n15:12\nThis snowboard when I was 12\n15:14\nThere's no one saying oh that's white\n15:15\nPeople shit black people don't do that\n15:17\nYeah no you don't do that don't put a\n15:20\nDamper on me and tell me what I can and\n15:23\nCan't be just because of the way\n15:25\nEveryone else was that's my same color\n15:28\nAnd I just feel like you are like good\n15:30\nTo tell them like no be you who you are\n15:32\nAs such the alternative to what\n15:36\nExpectations are placed on like a young\n15:39\nBlack guy growing up like it's always it\n15:42\nIt's you're influenced by kind of\n15:44\nEverything like just kind of like all\n15:46\nCulture and so do you think you accepted\n15:49\nThat about yourself through your music\n15:50\nOn the first oh I knew who I was at 12 I\n15:55\nThink you rapped maybe 28 percent of\n15:59\nAvailable it's like so I want it to my\n16:01\nGoal is I was to shut the fuck up and\n16:03\nLet all the features be the leaders yeah\n16:07\nYes Rex here sing for two minutes before\n16:10\nI come in with the a bar on boredom and\n16:12\nThen I'll have another a bar but I want\n16:14\nTo shut up and just let the string\n16:15\nSection be two minutes at the end\n16:17\nBoredom I think I this morning I was\n16:21\nLike boredom right now it to me is like\n16:23\nYou're Billie Jean really it really is\n16:26\nKind of a I seeing people connect with\n16:30\nThat so that song imput like I think I\n16:34\nCalled you and said I don't know if this\n16:36\nSong is creating an emotion for me or if\n16:39\nIt's like the soundtrack to something\n16:41\nAlready feel like that's how powerful I\n16:43\nThink\n16:45\nI wrote that literally it was a 5 p.m\n16:47\nOn a Saturday laying on my back looking\n16:50\nLike so bored it was nothing to do\n16:53\nNormos hit me back\n16:54\nJasper was in the other room bored out\n16:56\nOf his mind but I didn't see him all day\n16:58\nMy room was warm as hell because I like\n17:01\nThe heater on and it was nothing to eat\n17:02\nBut dry cereal mhm and I'm just sitting\n17:05\nThere like what the fuck am I gonna do\n17:07\nIt's and I literally wrote that verse in\n17:09\nLike 10 seconds cuz again it was these\n17:12\nQuestions and he's legit feelings of\n17:14\nBoredom that I was having and it was it\n17:17\nWas weird to me because it's like I'm in\n17:19\nA tax bracket where I could kind of go\n17:21\nYou doing me do whatever I have all\n17:23\nThese cards I could go drive you know I\n17:25\nHave I have nowhere to go and I'm just\n17:27\nBored and it was it was just confusing\n17:29\nTo me because it's like you don't\n17:31\nUnderstand how you could pass hell when\n17:33\nI be bored with it but it was nothing\n17:35\nInteresting to do at the moment which\n17:37\nWas crazy so I was like fuckin I'm gonna\n17:39\nWrite a song about it\n17:40\nAnd I was loving song I think I was\n17:43\nRight there I wrote this song over the\n17:45\nChords of God blessed the child by\n17:48\nStevie Wonder I figured out the chords\n17:50\nLooped it and just had it playing for\n17:52\nHours in my room and I wrote the verse\n17:54\nWhich was a 30 which was like a 40 bar\n17:57\nVerse originally but I cut it in half\n18:00\nBecause I was like the hook needs to\n18:01\nCome back so at the end of the first\n18:03\nVerse it's like I'm bored I did that\n18:08\nRight when he's editing because it went\n18:09\nTo the rest of the verse who was like\n18:11\nOriginally I'm bored and getting\n18:13\nDesperate phone is not even went\n18:14\nStraight to a different verse Oh\n18:16\nDifferent pockets like edit because I\n18:18\nWas like I need to put the hood back in\n18:20\nHere because I don't want to hear myself\n18:21\nBecause it's a weird chunk of our boy\n18:23\nBut right when we lose editing finishing\n18:27\nI was like no no fuck that put the hood\n18:29\nImma change the second verse yeah a\n18:31\nLittle bit in like so the pocket is\n18:33\nEasier to rap so everyone could say it\n18:35\nCuz it was too rapid II and I was like\n18:37\nI'm gonna hear this deep bass voice rap\n18:39\nFor that long let me shut the fuck up\n18:40\nAnd do a hood so all the white girls at\n18:42\nCoachella kiss ha ha ha ha ha ha and I'm\n18:44\nNot lying\n18:45\nDoing festivals you realize white people\n18:48\nLove singing along this shit yeah that's\n18:50\nWhy the fucking boredom is tomato\n18:52\nJustice like sway hey you when you\n18:56\nWhen you performing this on live you\n18:59\nStart on where this flower blooms\n19:00\nUsually and it's like is it a longer\n19:03\nIntro yeah yeah so when it's album I\n19:07\nWanted this I'm gonna sound like a\n19:08\nDisney score just like very magical my\n19:13\nPerfect little indie movie and fucking I\n19:17\nDon't like the album cover look yes I\n19:19\nWant the helmet cover looks like but it\n19:21\nTurned into you know when it turned into\n19:23\nBut when it's flower blooms I will have\n19:26\nThis really beautiful longer in short in\n19:28\nA bit but it sounds like the beginning\n19:31\nOf a sweeping and I start to shows with\n19:34\nThat because it's like bringing them\n19:37\nInto my world and then it drops it gets\n19:39\nCrazy but yeah wait and wait how long\n19:42\nDid you why did you trim it and not just\n19:44\nLet go it just by just wanted to cut the\n19:46\nFat\n19:47\nI wanted this album to be no longer than\n19:49\n45 minutes and I think we hit like 45\n19:54\nAnd 36 seconds or 46 minutes and I was\n19:58\nLike okay cool as short as possible on\n20:00\nIt to be short and get to the point yeah\n20:02\nUm you were saying uh like talking about\n20:05\nQuestions and every song is sparked by a\n20:08\nThing one of my faith it's my favorite\n20:12\nSequence of this but of these songs but\n20:16\nPothole is inspired by something your\n20:18\nMom said to you yeah yeah is that like\n20:21\nThat was a long time ago she was just\n20:23\nLike yo some some people just aren't\n20:27\nReally as lawyer or close to you as you\n20:33\nThink and I'm always like shut the fuck\n20:34\nUp like good to fuck you talking about\n20:36\nYeah sometimes moms know best and I've\n20:39\nHad to find out on my own like oh wow\n20:41\nLike your she was wrong about that\n20:45\nPerson\n20:46\nMm-hmm and I kind of wrote that verse\n20:48\nLike my mom told me blah blah blah blah\n20:50\nBlah and you just are just saying that\n20:54\nMore you started saying yeah and I even\n20:56\nEven just like and I and I did in the\n20:58\nCar like I drove back to the points\n21:00\nWhere she told me specifically like when\n21:04\nYou make three less it makes it right so\n21:06\nI yeah your life trying to double back\n21:09\nAnd the streets are filled with clues\n21:11\nThere's a great old me which by the\n21:13\nHawaiian realities that that's some of\n21:15\nYour best right I sense other familiars\n21:17\nI see some people I knew stuck in the\n21:19\nKota sac I pull up get out what up I'm\n21:21\nGonna help you but what you want for\n21:22\nSome people they don't want for\n21:24\nThemselves\n21:24\nJust leave them so do I stay here and\n21:26\nTry to figure it out or do I go and\n21:29\nTraffic is picking up and if I don't\n21:32\nLeave now and get on my path dude I need\n21:35\nTo do I'm gonna be stuck and five years\n21:38\nFrom now Tyler the Creator doesn't exist\n21:40\nSo it's either I stay here or I'll just\n21:42\nSay fucking and focus on what I gotta do\n21:44\nSo I speed off and I'm doing what I'm\n21:47\nDoing and I just metaphorically you want\n21:50\nNiggas to know like yo I'm still here\n21:53\nWhat power and my vehicle if you ever\n21:55\nNeed to jump or help or anything and but\n21:57\nI have to switch gears on them is there\n21:59\nI'm basically saying a damn verse blue\n22:02\nYeah no no no I mean it it's definitely\n22:05\nIt you can tell you are speaking to an\n22:08\nExperience or some experience and just\n22:10\nRealizing some not even in a negative\n22:13\nWay but some people are things are\n22:14\nPotholes and after too many potholes\n22:16\nYou're not gonna be able to get anywhere\n22:18\nCuz it just fucked the tire and the\n22:19\nWheel alignment and things up like that\n22:20\nAnd situations people certain things can\n22:23\nBe potholes to get to your end you're in\n22:26\nDestination and you just gotta watch out\n22:28\nAnd that's what my mother would always\n22:29\nTell me and I didn't believe her until I\n22:32\nHad to experience it on long Oh\n22:34\nWhen Jayden came at what point and Jane\n22:37\nAnd I was like when I when I wrote the\n22:38\nHook I was like oh my god Jaden's voice\n22:40\nWould be perfect for the tone of this\n22:42\nIssue yeah and I just had him come\n22:44\nThrough and he did it and he was so\n22:46\nHyped and he knocked it out so quick and\n22:47\nI fucking love Jayden that's my boy in\n22:50\nYeah yeah that because that's also I was\n22:53\nGonna say I mean I think lyrically one\n22:56\nOf your bet like you just seem to be in\n22:58\nA real zone right there did you record\n23:00\nThat in the album like was that uh that\n23:03\nWas the earliest song Loki for the how\n23:05\nLong I had that like September 2015 was\n23:09\nYour intention to rap more on the album\n23:11\nDidn't you do no I wanted to rap less\n23:13\nBut I end up wrapping some more because\n23:15\nThe versus Justin gonna be is so good\n23:17\nAnd then at the end of pothole it's this\n23:20\nGuy named Alex from wild high club\n23:22\nThis is bad I love my skip-tracing my\n23:25\nFavorite album last year yeah they put\n23:27\nOut in my favorite song number 10 Chapel\n23:30\nPerilous off skip-tracing is my fucking\n23:33\nThat song is such I can't wait to like\n23:36\nNew not die and I see a movie of my life\n23:39\nAnd it doesn't play such an important\n23:41\nPart but yeah yeah potholes yeah wha\n23:49\nDid you the song was complete then you\n23:52\nAdded just the snow that was in the my\n23:56\nWhen I first made the beat or whatever\n23:58\nIt was these chords I didn't use or\n24:01\nAnything but I just recorded them real\n24:02\nQuick just in the section in the session\n24:05\nAnd I just sang over real quick like it\n24:08\nWas like a melody I was fucking when I\n24:09\nLeft it at the end but when we were done\n24:11\nWith this song I was like oh I forgot\n24:12\nThat was there fuck it leave it at the\n24:14\nEnd and that's what that is\n24:16\nBecause what's crazy about it because of\n24:18\nThat piece and it goes into garden show\n24:21\nAnd I when I first heard it I I couldn't\n24:23\nTell I couldn't differentiate like the\n24:26\nSongs I just kind of flowed seamlessly\n24:29\nInto it and I I wasn't sure what because\n24:31\nAlso the way garden shed is structured\n24:33\nIs it's like three different emotions\n24:36\nLike that you go through it's like you\n24:38\nGo through in a whole emotional arc\n24:40\nBefore ever\n24:41\nSpeaking on the record what mood were\n24:44\nYou going for like what was I remember\n24:46\nMaking that I had those chords on piano\n24:49\nAnd I was like it's not hitting so I\n24:51\nAustin I'm so hollow is coming just play\n24:54\nWe play the get the chords on the guitar\n24:55\nAnd I had it looped it was just there\n24:59\nWent to sleep woke up early the next\n25:01\nMorning played it and literally just was\n25:04\nLike let me at the most simple drums did\n25:07\nThat was like added a quick synth\n25:09\nThere's like want to take a turn\n25:13\nYeah hits and then go back to being the\n25:14\nPrettiest thing ever yeah and I was like\n25:16\nFuck her she went see and I was like oh\n25:18\nMy god I think this is the most\n25:21\nBeautiful thing I've ever done and it\n25:23\nTook a year to write the singing parts\n25:27\nAnd figure it out there was so many\n25:29\nOther melodies and I was like wait this\n25:31\nIs supposed to\n25:32\nI have much mm-hmm so when I wrote the\n25:35\nParts figured it out I was like Estelle\n25:38\nWould be great\n25:40\nYep with her accent and just her tone\n25:43\nSorry gonna tournament I'm gonna turn\n25:46\nAnd I was like my voice can't do it my\n25:48\nRecipe but she came and she figured out\n25:51\nHe's a professional and it was it was\n25:53\nReally fun doing that work and for the\n25:56\nVerse I was like let me rap double time\n25:58\nBecause in its three it's three one two\n26:01\nThree so it's we're kind I was like fuck\n26:02\nIt I'm gonna make sure my pocket is just\n26:04\nCrazy just like jumping all over the\n26:07\nPlace just to give it a new feel from\n26:10\nThe first half that effect on even just\n26:13\nSaying garbage because the way you say\n26:16\nIt and it's like so I've always kind of\n26:20\nHated my voice mmm so like my stuff from\n26:23\nLike 2008 I will pitch it up in 2009-10\n26:26\nI will put you down\n26:27\nMm-hmm cuz I just hated it so around\n26:30\nThis time I was like let me give myself\n26:31\nA fake accent I don't know what it is\n26:33\nBut let me start pronouncing shit dear\n26:35\nSo garnish I go to Chicago for the\n26:38\nBottle but like bored and getting this\n26:40\nThrough this hell said like I wanted to\n26:42\nDo that cuz I was like I hate my voice\n26:44\nLet me make it interesting for myself it\n26:46\nWas oh I ain't got time mm-hm\n26:50\nYou got time I'm just like man that song\n26:57\nIs so busy and so crazy I don't need to\n27:00\nMatch that let me be super chill about\n27:02\nIt and just like Barney the Kleenex how\n27:05\nI got this fun let me just be smooth and\n27:08\nCool on that motherfucker I think that\n27:09\nTime sounds like it sounds like it and I\n27:13\nPutting earrings in a person about the\n27:15\nFight yes yes that's what I want I\n27:18\nWanted that intro to be like oh shit oh\n27:21\nWe should leave yes I when he drives a\n27:24\nSlight and it's almost like Latin about\n27:25\nLike that beginning yeah so that's a\n27:29\nSample from my mind won't blink but I\n27:32\nHad looted and originally that wasn't it\n27:35\nSo I originally made I ain't got time\n27:38\nLife of Pablo sessions in a studio\n27:40\nMm-hmm but in Konya get on it that just\n27:43\nSeems like a Michael but I thought I'll\n27:45\nBeat I ain't got time for these need you\n27:48\nHad you it was just my hand touch it was\n27:51\nAttempted intent and that was a whole\n27:54\nSeparate beat so then I was like fuck is\n27:57\nSomething here something cool about that\n27:58\nI got time hook which I was bad I hooked\n28:02\nSo when I had that hook I was like man I\n28:04\nFinally did something great\n28:05\nYeah so I kind of mesh these two beats\n28:07\nTogether and it was a different beat I\n28:09\nHad with the turn thinner that put it\n28:11\nTogether like okay I got a hook I had my\n28:15\nFirst verse so I need a clean mix happy\n28:16\nBirthday\n28:17\nYou bitch the hook and I was like man on\n28:20\nThe second verse I know yeah is not\n28:22\nDoesn't like this song so Nicki Minaj's\n28:25\nVoice will be fucking perfect for this\n28:28\nYeah\n28:28\nWe sent it to her she's like horribles\n28:31\nWill swill hear that weird out mic a\n28:34\nMonth later it was like she couldn't\n28:35\nCome up with that damn

add a\n28:48\nSecond verse and I was like that turn it\n28:50\nWould be so proud of me and when I was\n28:51\nYounger and that turner was so cool to\n28:53\nMe because he rebelled against all that\n28:55\nShit so why the motherfuckers what I\n28:58\nDidn't want to say that all these white\n29:00\nBoys got they stopped for me and so I\n29:01\nJust wanted to sound like mother fuck\n29:03\nLike you want to be emotional I wanted\n29:05\nThe emotional turn or something\n29:08\nSomething that Turner talks the way but\n29:10\nYou a house nigga so you don't know him\n29:12\nI should go a rough one with my big lips\n29:14\nAnd my big nose in my short head cuz you\n29:17\nKnow I already know how slow my shit\n29:18\nGrow and you switch and then I said I\n29:20\nWant that

decision for you not to join cuz I\n36:31\nWas like I was like no I just have a\n36:33\nLittle hook at the end mm-hmm but I want\n36:36\nTo hear Wayne over these notes and up\n36:40\nThis pocket and I want to see what he\n36:42\nWould do and his high-pitched voice over\n36:44\nThis lower tone of like this this weird\n36:47\nBrian Bennett like lounge library music\n36:50\nI made I want Wayne over that because I\n36:54\nMean after a while hearing hearing\n36:56\nWeighing over some like a toe weights\n36:58\nAnd some shit like that it's like cool\n37:00\nWell he becomes really cool like it's

and garden is so supposed\n37:13\nSupposed to sound like a score but it\n37:15\nEnded up changing and this was one of\n37:17\nThe first songs finished like pothole\n37:18\nAnd drop a seed and I was like yo just\n37:21\nWipe about flowers and garden trees\n37:24\nWhatever and I was on tour for Cherry\n37:27\nBomb in Omaha Nebraska mm-hmm and I got\n37:29\nA text from him like check your

versions\n38:10\nLonger but yeah how long did you make it\n38:13\nLike initially and why and why I wanted\n38:16\nIt simply short just as just one of\n38:19\nThose just inner lose that\n38:20\nKeep on in a replay but that's um that's\n38:24\nLike the music that plays in my head\n38:28\nJust daydreaming just those chords just\n38:30\nLike in my dream world\n38:33\nIt's chords I just play in the air\n38:36\nMm-hmm like 20 that's all my dream\n38:38\nPlanet that's what it is but that's\n38:41\nLiterally just my daydream just music\n38:44\nJust notes and that's what it is no\n38:47\nDrums just melody and then that's when\n38:50\nThey'll shake power and then shame\n38:52\nPowers voice which fits really perfect\n38:55\nReally well with the juxtaposition\n38:58\nConferences you want to be super fuck it\n38:59\nWhat is so aggressive goes in to see you\n39:02\nAgain with the humans in my dream state\n39:04\nYeah I mean that's cuz that's my that's\n39:07\nMy daydream music sometimes yeah

on in square\n45:23\nCircle or anything from 87 88 that weird\n45:27\nTime could be a crime I could be awful\n45:29\nBut it just sounds like an updated\n45:32\nStevie Wonder song if Timberlake or\n45:35\nSomeone was gonna sing over reality just\n45:42\nKeeps on just going there it's perfect\n45:45\nAnd dant done turn turn turn turn\n45:48\nLike yeah I'm just like is that

the ending of - hi wait just\n46:03\nBecause the the tempo kind of slows down\n46:05\nJust like it's it's one of the greatest\n46:09\nLike just slow down the it lands like a\n46:11\nReef so when your love is looking for\n46:17\nAnother pure love crazy looking for\n46:18\nAnother pure love is the weirdest temple\n46:22\nLike it's like think about that temple\n46:24\nOf just like yeah yeah like so

a woman in that shot that looks\n47:23\nLike my mom it's already low the thing\n47:27\nAnd then there's this a woman in a shot\n47:28\nThat looks like my mom and and I just\n47:30\nWatch it and almost crying she's crazy\n47:33\nUm wait wait wait a because the Stevie\n47:39\nI'm blanking on it was a it was another\n47:42\nQuestion off of something you said but\n47:43\nOkay that so that's you and Pharrell\n47:47\nWettest faretta Pharrell just comes in\n47:49\nWith vocals on the thing yeah I just\n47:50\nSeems like can I use these ovo cuz he's\n47:52\nLike yeah and I was just like let me\n47:54\nJust have it at the end and that that's\n47:57\nThis shit that makes five-year-old me\n47:58\nMale that's when I was five the notes\n48:01\nAnd I didn't know what chords were what\n48:03\nAnything was but I was always saying it\n48:05\nGoes down and you know it slants it's\n48:07\nSlang I played a song for you by Stevie\n48:11\nWonder and take six why I feel this way\n48:15\nAnd I remember you were like almost\n48:17\nCorrect like you made me turn it off and\n48:19\nYou're like in a fetal position a key\n48:20\nCause of all I know that I don't know\n48:22\nWhat the fuck those notes do to me ever\n48:24\nSince I remember being seven mm-hmm and\n48:27\nWhen it will rain I will put on either\n48:29\nUh number three from love deluxe by\n48:31\nSHINee couldn't love you more or I will\n48:34\nPut on number ten always on my mind by\n48:36\nBrandi yeah and it was court I would\n48:39\nJust look at the sky and I won't cry\n48:42\nBecause the chords would just do\n48:44\nSomething to me and I don't know what it\n48:46\nIs I can't explain that whole when I die\n48:48\nThis gets explained to me but they do\n48:50\nSomething to me and I've it's almost\n48:51\nLike a dog whistle for like dogs if it\n48:54\nCauses\n48:55\nI think we have a lot of similar quote\n48:58\nBecause we've talked about like

you\n51:04\nGet that like you were talking about the\n51:05\nOh I know I was gonna say\n51:07\nJose Feliciano also did like my fire and\n51:10\nIt was is this one guitar kind of think\n51:13\nRiff that he does that I just want to\n51:15\nLoop over and over also like what do you\n51:19\nPlan piano room that I loop a wild wolf\n51:22\nWolf would you ensure the course of wolf\n51:24\nAre perfect night like I was this video\n51:27\nOf just you doing the over and over\n51:30\nBecause it's just as beautiful that's my\n51:32\nFather always like that even in Yonkers\n51:34\nLike the second verse is just some piano\n51:35\nChords that comes yeah few seconds and\n51:37\nI'm like like I had I have another\n51:40\nVersion of that word that just loosed I\n51:41\nWanna talk about the what kind of the\n51:44\nOpposite of these beautiful chord in\n51:46\nMotion November is like one of the\n51:48\nHeaviest songs right and it's you're\n51:53\nLike paranoid is that is that the theme\n51:55\nWould you say this so that was the thing\n51:56\nThat was a last song for the album that\n51:59\nYou record it yeah literally and it was\n52:04\nJust me thinking just literally yeah\n52:06\nMade me be like what is are you a nancy\n52:10\nOver what if when I put who that boy out\n52:13\nNo one cares what if I'm hustling\n52:15\nBackwards what if my accountant is\n52:17\nStealing money from me and I don't know\n52:18\nIt yeah just everything that could be\n52:20\nThe worst thing that could happen to me\n52:22\nAt that moment I was just like what is I\n52:25\nRemember talking to Clancy right after\n52:27\nAnd he was just like yeah I'm he has a\n52:29\nLove/hate with me on the sidewalk but\n52:30\nThe pothole is like only trust me about\n52:33\nNovember's just like this motherfuckers\n52:35\nStealing his would be this whole like\n52:39\nBut is it was it just you it seemed like\n52:42\nA journal entry yeah in November of 2016\n52:47\nWas probably the greatest time of my\n52:49\nLife why we have rented a house out\n52:52\nEvery morning we will wake up right for\n52:55\nThe jelly's mm-hmm\n52:56\nI was starting to get involved with\n52:58\nCommerce\n53:00\nAfter I was done we would spend time at\n53:05\nLeast me and Jasper playing the game I\n53:07\nWent bought the VRS stupid PlayStation\n53:09\nWe had the new Mario switch when we were\n53:13\nDone working why it will come out and go\n53:15\nTo the park or just like go bike riding\n53:16\nOr just whatever go to shows and then I\n53:19\nWill go to studio and I'll be working on\n53:21\nThe album\n53:21\nSome of us show November and then a\n53:24\nPerson it it could like it could be a\n53:28\nPerson it could be a song it could be a\n53:30\nTime but just those things that just\n53:32\nMake you super happy and it's kind of\n53:35\nLike the totem in Inception yeah yeah\n53:38\nLiterally in the house we had on call\n53:40\nWater was just an amazing time yeah and\n53:45\nI was literally wearing Hawaiian shirts\n53:48\nIn January\n53:49\nIt means cold that was the mindset you\n53:54\nWere in yeah it was sir it was fucking\n53:57\nGreat dude it was so goddamn good yeah\n54:00\nI'm but it's funny how if you would have\n54:03\nEnded the album with November how it\n54:05\nWould change people will be like yo give\n54:08\nThis yo are you okay oh yeah no people\n54:10\nYou okay very concerned about well yeah\n54:13\nI'm really glad that you kind of\n54:16\nSwitched it went up and and I was at\n54:19\nBeing a car ride and me ending that\n54:22\nVerse on November with what if I thought\n54:25\nThe break was the gas what if I crash\n54:26\nYes these deep thoughts is my last let\n54:29\nMe pull over quick yeah that's when I\n54:31\nMake the phone call for glitter which is\n54:33\nJust a voicemail or whatever he he but\n54:37\nAll yeah it all ties in it why flowers\n54:40\nI never asked you like what what was\n54:43\nLike the symbolism behind you they're\n54:45\nBeautiful\n54:46\nYou just nature like handy and I thought\n54:49\nIt would be cool yeah and that cover\n54:51\nBeing gold an hour\n54:52\nFor the past few months every go to now\n54:54\nOur listen a night and day buy\n54:56\nEverything but the girl mm-hmm and\n54:57\nTracey thorn is the singer who sings\n55:00\nFrom everything but the girl they have a\n55:01\nLot of great songs and the first part of\n55:04\nNovember is me singing I wrote that\n55:11\nMorning Tracy dorna go there but I'd\n55:14\nNever asked because for that specific\n55:17\nPart I already got rejected by Rick Ross\n55:19\nI wanted to a bar from him there so this\n55:22\nVoice it's such a heavy voice the tone\n55:25\nOf his laser over that been perfect yeah\n55:27\nIt kind of didn't work out and I was\n55:30\nLike whatever so I just put that ref\n55:31\nThere for Tracey thorn but I never went\n55:35\nThrough with it because I just was like\n55:36\nI just want to finish this album I'm\n55:38\nOver it\n55:40\nI feel defeated fuck it I'll just leave\n55:42\nMy voice there and that's and that's\n55:44\nWhat that is\n55:44\nAnd I want it I want to play boy cardi\n55:46\nOh on November 1 upon where I'm like\n55:50\nTake me back take me back yeah I think\n55:53\nThat I think his voice is like a go-kart\n55:56\nBut I knew your army Lee rock like the\n55:59\nHandling chauffeurs son\n56:01\nMm I thought this is not pop this rock\n56:03\nListen up and I think it's so sick yeah\n56:05\nSo that part in November was a take me\n56:09\nBack I was gonna get played with car do\n56:10\nYou do it that would have been Rick Ross\n56:12\nYou playboy card entries or just would\n56:18\nYeah great he came out great and it's\n56:24\nCrazy a lot of these songs on this album\n56:25\nIs just songs that people didn't take\n56:29\nYou know I think because it came out and\n56:31\nIt works I could now maybe be like hey\n56:35\nPop artists\n56:36\nI just want to produce more hey I could\n56:39\nWrite a cool little melody like let's do\n56:41\nIt hopefully no one's called yet but I\n56:44\nMean but you want to do that you want to\n56:46\nJust like all I want to do like if I\n56:48\nHave that I could be successful in that\n56:49\nCuz you always talked about wanting to\n56:51\nScore things you talked about this or\n56:53\nSome your score or a few things and just\n56:56\nProduce songs I don't I don't have to\n56:59\nWrap it all and make clothes and just\n57:01\nCreate other shit but I don't but it's\n57:05\nFun it's fun like it but I mean I gotta\n57:07\nSay that I mean I'll go fucking put a\n57:09\nVerse on something cuz it's still fun\n57:10\nYeah but but it's not even just about\n57:13\nIt's more feeling you don't you almost\n57:15\nCreate music like a director you know\n57:17\nIt's all it's about the encompassing\n57:20\nFeeling\n57:21\nEverything you know what I mean so it's\n57:23\nLike like again like garden shed is like\n57:25\nIt's just an emotion that then you wrap\n57:27\nOn when it suits the emotion like guard\n57:30\nSure sounds like the indie movies I like\n57:32\nYeah then who that boy sounds like\n57:35\nHorror I was just a goddamn score yeah\n57:39\nYou know somebody gotta give me a\n57:41\nGoddamn chance the 70 year old white\n57:44\nDude still do it like cool well I mean\n57:47\nYou have such an amazing here and you\n57:51\nKnow

forever\nNothing sticks together\nSick of sitting in doubt\nPlease let me figure this out\n\nShout out to the girls that I lead on\nFor occasional head and always keeping my bed warm\nAnd trying their

have 'til I run out of road?\nHow much road can they pave 'til I run out of land?\nHow much land can there be until I run in the ocean?\nYou niggas go with the motions and all the plans\nSea I was never into the beaches and all the sands\nSee, I was in the woods with flowers, rainbows and posies\nFalling outta my pocket, but ya'll want to know if I swam to cool down\nHow much cooler can I get until I run out of fans?\nHow many fans can I have until they turn on the AC?\nIf the AC blows, well then I'm TNT, I'm gone\n\nI'm gone and I'm finished\nAnd I ain't seen my friends in a minute\nGuessing nothing lasts forever\nYeah, nothing lasts forever\nNothing sticks together\nSick of sitting in doubt\nPlease let me figure this out\n\nShout out to the girls that I lead on\nFor occasional head and always keeping my bed warm\nAnd trying their hardest to keep my head on straight\nAnd keeping me up enough 'til I had thought I was airborne\nHow many raps can I write 'til I get me a chain?\nHow many chains can I wear 'til I'm considered a slave?\nHow many slaves can it be 'til Nat Turner arise?\nHow many riots can it be 'til them Black lives matter?\nNiggas click clack splatter, pew, pew that nigga\nLife a game of basketball, you better shoot that nigga\n'Cause if that cop got trigger, he better pull\n'Cause when I get pulled over, I usually play it cool\n'Cause I know what I'm driving is usually paid in full\nAnd my ego and possessions, will not let me be one\nBecause I got a mansion, my mansion got some rooms\nThem rooms got some windows and my windows got some views\nThem views get some stares and my backyard does too\nAnd if you walk to the bottom you'll prolly see a pool\nYou better not drown, keep them ten toes up\n'Cause if those ten toes down, that mean that you fucked up\nAnd that's what I swim in\n\nAnd if I drown and don't come back\nWho's gonna know? (Maybe then I'll know)\nAnd if I crash and don't come back\nWho's gonna know? (Maybe then I'll know)\nAnd if I fall and don't come back\nWho's gonna know? (Maybe then I'll know)\nI'm wondering if I don't come back\nMaybe then I'll know"}}, {"title": "French", "album": "Bastard", "year": "2009-12-25", "lyrics": "Got all the black bitches mad cause my main bitch vanilla\nShe tryna get her groove back like Stella, grab the umbrella\nWhen it comes to your perception of my shit, I'm Helen Keller\nWhen it comes to the perfection of my shit, I know you smell the\nRectum, I'm like a chromosome, I always X 'em\nLike Wolverine stepson attacking a deadly weapon\nI'm opening a church to sell coke and Led Zeppelin\nAnd fuck Mary in her ass...\nYo, I'm fucking Goldilocks up in the forest\nIn the three bear house eating their mothafuckin' porridge\nI tell her it's my house, give her a tour\nIn my basement, and keep that bitch locked up in my storage\nRape her and record it, then edit it with more shit\nOctopussy special effect the wet bitches be banging\nAnd please never disrespect my set\nWith Canons hanging from our necks like it's a mothafuckin' circus\n\nYou little niggas better (check my French)\nYou getting money?

Zeppelin\nAnd fuck Mary in her ass...\nYo, I'm fucking Goldilocks up in the forest\nIn the three bear house eating their mothafuckin' porridge\nI tell her it's my house, give her a tour\nIn my basement, and keep that bitch locked up in my storage\nRape her and record it, then edit it with more shit\nOctopussy special effect the wet bitches be banging\nAnd please never disrespect my set\nWith Canons hanging from our necks like it's a mothafuckin' circus\n\nYou little niggas better (check my French)\nYou getting money? Better (check my French)\nWhat time is it, huh?

I don't think so\nWe sick shit, throw it up down in the sink, yo\nThese Odd niggas are beginning to spill these pink flows\nWe think sorta odd, so we think so\n\nCrusing in my go-kart at Walmart selling cupcakes\nGo ahead admit it, faggot, this shit is tighter than butt rape\nThat involve Ballpark Franks and silver duct tape\nPornos and hormones and boxes of DiGiorno\nYou homos is loco, you're probably drinking Cuervo\nWith some vatos with the door closed watching Zorro\nYou homos\n\nO.F., yes\n(So, are you dating anyone right now?

occupied by Senorita\nAnd mother keeps on bugging me about wanting to meet her\nI don't really need her, I'm just tryna treat her real nice\nSo later on, up in the night, I could go beat her\nAnd make a lie about the gonorrhea\nSo she don't feel guilty about me wanting to leave her\nThat \"fuck\" on my t-shirt print is cheetah\nAnd I got that '87 bunny flow, like an Easter\nBasket, you faggots, is plastic, like nerds with old glasses\nBut I'm still liable to get my ass kicked\nConned-Sort actor, a Baby Milo addict in the attic\nWhere you losers can't get me\nNikon and the Canon, they were never the same\nAnd please do not take a picture, I can't be seen with you lames\n\nMan, y'all some muthafuckin' lames\nMan, y'all some muthafuckin' lames\nDon't lie to yourself, y'all some lames\nMan, y'all some lames\nThe Canon don't flash, y'all some lames\nI cannot be seen with you lames\nYou mothafuckas is some lames\n\nCan't stop for, flashing, like a cop car\nMe and.. rock well, I'm a rock star\nFuck y'all the O.F. is banging on 'em\nCustom Crew-necks Rollin' while we're Ronald Regan on 'em\nY'all drug dealers, I Carl Sagan on 'em\nChop and screw Nas tracks, I got piano's waiting on 'em\nMy shirt is yellow, but the grill is gold\nI couldn't take the Ritalin cause my therapist the pill is old\nI can't skate, but I guess that's lost control\nI don't have sense, sorry I sold my soul\nFor some gold Bapes low-price, stale rate\nAuthentic, never fake, check the poll, our statistic\nStay with authentics, check my steelo\nCause my mob's goodie like we Ceelo\nAnd he know, I am yes and even she know\nEvery instrument is a gram, kilo\n\nOFM, Bangin' on your FM"}}, {"title": "FUCKING YOUNG / PERFECT", "album": "Cherry Bomb", "year": "2015-04-13", "lyrics": "Part 1 - FUCKING YOUNG\n\nDay that I met you girl\nI knew that it was something special\nBut I couldn't put my finger on it (Fuck I can't sing, whatever look)\nWe met through mutual friends (Mutual friends)\nAnd this is where the story and confusion begin\nCause I was at nirvana but I had to pretend that I wasn't\n\nThere go the police man (Knocking at my door)\nDo I leave out the back and (Grab my wallet and coat)\nOr do I answer real confused like (\"I don't know\")\nNow me and she held hands (And we danced, nothing more)\nShe kissed my hand a couple times, (FaceTime when we're bored)\nThere's nobody at the door, (Man, I'm so paranoid)\nFuck, 'cause\n\nCause girl you're perfect, but you're too fucking young (for me)\nAnd when temptation calls my phone, I never pick up\nAnd girl, you stole my heart but you're too fucking young\nThis is more than a crush, I just might be in love\n\nA six year (Difference) is a ten year (Sentence)\nAnd with the (Pigment) on my skin\nI don't want to be another (Statistic)\nYou bring me (Joy, joy, joy, joy)\nAnd you fill a void that was once missing\nAnd (I can say I'm in love)\n\nThere go the police man (Knocking at my door)\nDo I leave out the back and

time comes for that 1-8\nI'll probably run, cause I'm fucking terrified\nYo this is dumb,you should find someone else\nI'm not the one for you, shit, I'm still growing up by myself\nAnd mentally you're older than me and that shit doesn't help\nCause if they see you with T, they'll think T needs some help\nSo when you mention \"hang,\" I'm thinking about a tree and a belt\nAnd I don't want no relation, shit no relation\nShip when my dick is longer than my attention-\nSpan, it's gonna suck your shit, it's that kitchen fan\nIt splattered on me like my dick in my hand\nWhat? I'm still fucking off, not good at ducking off\nBecause I found a goose that I like, but I'm still running off\nShe gon' want a nest, that's why I cannot get fucking caught\nThat's a scary word, you could save that shit for the birds\nBut I found my wings, fuck, (But you're too fucking young)\nI really like you, I don't know what to do (And when temptation calls, I never pick up\nAnd girl, you stole my heart but you're too fucking young)\nFunny thing about this is, by the time you hear this\nIt won't even matter, I'll be in the clear, it's T and Uncle Charlie\n(But you're too young, but you're too young, but you're too young)\nPart 2 - PERFECT\n\nBoy I know, that we could be more\nThan just friends, but you're scared\nBoy I know, that we could be more\nThan just friends, but you're scared (I know)\n\nI know that there could be\nSomethin' for you and me\nWhat's your philosophy?\nYou're scared, scared\nAnd I exit and wait a while\nJust say the word\nCan't you see the answers are all there\nBut I'm just too blind to see\nYou and I are cut from different fabric\nI wonder why, I wonder why, girl\nDon't be too material to see\nBut I'm just too blind to see\nSomehow, this world is such a struggle just to be\nFuck 'em all baby, it's just you and me\n\nBut you're too fuckin' young\nAnd, girl, I know that you're the one for me\nFuck, cause you're too fuckin' young\nAnd, girl, I know that you're the one for me\nAnd it hurts, it fuckin' hurts\nCause you're too fuckin' young\nAnd, girl, I know that you're the one\nThat you're the one, for me\nCause you're too fuckin' young\nAnd, girl, I know that you're the one for me, yeah\n\nI rock\nI rock\nI rock", "image": "https://images.genius.com/dd2408d3a2d34699d2bb3e448679b7f1.1000x1000x1.jpg", "artist": "Tyler, The Creator", "raw": {"annotation_count": 38, "api_path": "/songs/745210", "description": {"dom": {"tag": "root", "children": [{"tag": "p", "children": ["\u201cFucking Young\u201d explores Tyler falling in love with a girl six years younger than him.

at nirvana but I had to pretend that I wasn't\n\nThere go the police man (Knocking at my door)\nDo I leave out the back and (Grab my wallet and coat)\nOr do I answer real confused like (\"I don't know\")\nNow me and she held hands (And we danced, nothing more)\nShe kissed my hand a couple times, (FaceTime when we're bored)\nThere's nobody at the door, (Man, I'm so paranoid)\nFuck, 'cause\n\nCause girl you're perfect, but you're too fucking young (for me)\nAnd when temptation calls my phone, I never pick up\nAnd girl, you stole my heart but you're too fucking young\nThis is more than a crush, I just might be in love\n\nA six year (Difference) is a ten year (Sentence)\nAnd with the (Pigment) on my skin\nI don't want to be another (Statistic)\nYou bring me (Joy, joy, joy, joy)\nAnd you fill a void that was once missing\nAnd (I can say I'm in love)\n\nThere go the police man (Knocking at my door)\nDo I leave out the back and (Grab my wallet and coat)\nOr do I answer

ain't no cuz\nBut I'm wearing all red cause im a yellow\nPerson and only im screamin'\nI don't bust nuts I fill your girls mouth with white stuff\n\n\nI got friends that sell drugs\nGuess where we at, we at the social hall\nWith them bitches hitting them swishas\nGive me them lips and we giving them hugs\nYou already know we be all gang banging\nAlready know that we got drugs going to the store\nProbably buying some pancake mix\nI dont even go to the store\n\n\nYeah, what you know about wearing a sweater\nThat don't match what my shoes like homie\nI don't play that shit I got a gun\nHomie don't walk you better skip\nFuck that trick, fuck that ho\nI make money, I make cheddar\nYou know who I am, you know where I be\nYou know plus 1 plus 2 is 4\nAll up in the club, now I'm at

fight him\nI got violent, long story short he's not breathing\nFor some reason I liked it and it was really exciting\nCouldn't stop the addiction, and the irony is\nA couple junkies went missing and I know right where they're hiding\n\nDope in the bag, pretty bitch on the side\nI sell dope in the back, if you tryna get high\nDope in the bag, Pretty bitch on the side\nI sell dope in the back, if you tryna get high\nDope in the bag, pretty bitch on the side\nI sell dope in the back, if you tryna get high\nDope in the bag, Pretty bitch on the side\nI sell dope in the back, if you tryna get high\n\nTask force poured into my fortress\nFound some lipstick, a couple corpses\nBitches was harmed and they couldn't reach the alarm\nI'm ripping sockets out like I had fucking problems with arms\nThey found a couple portraits on the porch\nBut they don't check up under the floor\nIt's bodies and hotties and we was raging I'm gauging a shotty\nHit so many bitches I was pimping like Scotty\nI'm a bull, red, piss me off\nLike that lipstick position when she kissed me\nSo I bit 'em off, they was too soft, I'm a Wolf\nAnd a designer mixing skin cotton leather and wool\nAnd most people like flying kites, riding bikes in the woods\nBaking cake cause its good, I mean I would if I could\nBut I like playing dress up and mix match\nSorry I'mma 'fess up, you aren't getting your kids back\n\nDope in the bag, pretty bitch on the side\nI sell dope in the back, if you tryna get high\nDope in the bag, pretty bitch on the side\nI sell dope in the back, if you tryna get high\nDope in the bag, Pretty bitch on the side\nI sell dope in the back, if you tryna die\n\nWhat's in my trunk? White, girl\nWhat's in my trunk? White, girl\nYou need a warrant, officer\n\nYou could say I kill 'em, if my product doesn't\nCouple basement stairs where I drug them, down\nIt's pretty disgusting, finger crush your face\nI'll leave you permanently blushing, blood\nNosebleed drugs, cook you in the oven\nDrums", "image": "https://images.genius.com/0b15e54db4148fb09424391967a73bc2.480x480x1.png", "artist": "Tyler, The Creator", "raw": {"annotation_count": 29, "api_path": "/songs/209547", "description": {"dom": {"tag": "root", "children": [{"tag": "p", "children": ["\u201cGarbage\u201d was written when Tyler was finishing his track ", {"tag": "a", "attributes": {"href": "http://www.genius.com/tyler-the-creator-48-lyrics"}, "data": {"api_path": "/songs/133409"}, "children": ["\u201c48\u201d"]}, " off of his album ", {"tag": "a", "attributes": {"href": "https://genius.com/albums/Tyler-the-creator/Wolf"}, "data": {"api_path": "/albums/18842"}, "children": [{"tag": "em", "children": ["Wolf"]}]}, ".

invite him, so instead tried to fight him\nI got violent, long story short he's not breathing\nFor some reason I liked it and it was really exciting\nCouldn't stop the addiction, and the irony is\nA couple junkies went missing and I know right where they're hiding\n\nDope in the bag, pretty bitch on the side\nI sell dope in the back, if you tryna get high\nDope in the bag, Pretty bitch on the side\nI sell dope in the back, if you tryna get high\nDope in the bag, pretty bitch on the side\nI sell dope in the back, if you tryna get high\nDope in the bag, Pretty bitch on the side\nI sell dope in the back, if you tryna get high\n\nTask force poured into my fortress\nFound some lipstick, a couple corpses\nBitches was harmed and they couldn't reach the alarm\nI'm ripping sockets out like I had fucking problems with arms\nThey found a couple portraits on the porch\nBut they don't check up under the floor\nIt's bodies and hotties and we was raging I'm gauging a shotty\nHit so many bitches I was pimping like Scotty\nI'm a bull, red, piss me off\nLike that lipstick position when she kissed me\nSo I bit 'em off, they was too soft, I'm a Wolf\nAnd a designer mixing skin cotton leather and wool\nAnd most people like flying kites, riding bikes in the woods\nBaking cake cause its good, I mean I would if I could\nBut I like playing dress up and mix match\nSorry I'mma 'fess up, you aren't getting your kids back\n\nDope in the bag, pretty bitch on the side\nI sell dope in the back, if you tryna get high\nDope in the bag, pretty bitch on the side\nI sell dope in the back, if you tryna get high\nDope in the bag, Pretty bitch on the side\nI sell dope in the back, if you tryna die\n\nWhat's in my trunk? White, girl\nWhat's in my trunk? White, girl\nYou need a warrant, officer\n\nYou could say I kill 'em, if my product doesn't\nCouple basement stairs where I drug them, down\nIt's pretty disgusting, finger crush your face\nI'll leave you permanently blushing, blood\nNosebleed drugs, cook you in the oven\nDrums"}}, {"title": "Garden Shed", "album": "Flower Boy", "year": "2017-07-21", "lyrics": "Don't kill a rose\nBefore it could bloom\nFly, baby, fly\nOut the cocoon\n\nYou don't have to hide\nI can smell it in your eyes\nThat there's something more to say, baby\nThem words\nDamn, run me back, yeah\n\nIf I could, if I could\nIf you could\nFind the words to say\nFind the words to say\nFind the words\nIn the garden\nShed\nGo\n\nDon't kill a rose\nBefore it could bloom\nFly, baby, fly\nOut the cocoon\n\nAyo\nGarden shed, garden shed, garden shed, garden shed\nFor the garden\nThat is where I was hidin'\nThat was real love I was in\nAin't no reason to pretend\nGarden shed, garden shed, garden shed\nGarden shed for the gar\u00e7ons\nThem feelings that I was guardin'\nHeavy on my mind\nAll my friends lost\nThey couldn't read the signs\nI didn't wanna talk and tell 'em my location\nAnd they ain't wanna walk\nTruth is, since a youth kid, thought it was a phase\nThought it'd be like the phrase; \"poof,\" gone\nBut, it's still goin' on\nBig fan of the beige tan\nPolka dot nose, how it goes\nHad to keep it on the subwoofer\nA couple butterflies wanna float\nBut I was always like, \"Eh\"\nBarely interested, but bagged just to brag to my boys like, \"Bruh\"\nThis is a crucial subject matter\nSensitive like cookin' batter\n'Til the temperature that's risin'\nSteppin' on that ladder, tryna\nGrab the rings of Saturn, I'ma\nPlanet by the time you hear this\nShit and chatter 'bout the heat\nIt will not fuckin' matter", "image": "https://images.genius.com/0c9e23c71714698b4c582f5aa7ed8cfb.1000x1000x1.jpg", "artist": "Tyler, The Creator", "raw": {"annotation_count": 15, "api_path": "/songs/3146672", "description": {"dom": {"tag": "root", "children": [{"tag": "p", "children": ["On \u201cGarden Shed,\u201d Tyler uses the titular imagery as an extended metaphor for keeping one\u2019s sexual orientation concealed, more commonly referred to as being \u201cin the closet.\u201d Although it\u2019s unclear whether or not he is actually coming out, he does ", {"tag": "a", "attributes": {"href": "https://genius.com/12309724"}, "data": {"api_path": "/referents/12309724"}, "children": ["directly address the notion"]}, " in the second verse."]}, "", {"tag": "p", "children": ["In the past, Tyler has hinted at his sexual orientation with ", {"tag": "a", "attributes": {"href": "https://twitter.com/fucktyler/status/749813596088102912/photo/1", "rel": "nofollow"}, "children": ["drawings,"]}, " ", {"tag": "a", "attributes": {"href": "https://twitter.com/tylerthecreator/status/587459235706900480?", "rel": "nofollow"}, "children": ["tweets,"]}, " and ", {"tag": "a", "attributes": {"href": "https://genius.com/7960467"}, "data": {"api_path": "/referents/7960467"}, "children": ["lyrics"]}, ", but here he takes on a more explicit and serious tone.

with Ralph Lauren, white tees is borin'\nThat's why I rock the best\nMy nigga get fresh\n\nI'm color coordinated (get fresh)\nMan I color coordinated this so (get fresh)\nHe is color coordinated (it's fresh)\n\nYeah, all white Polos, self title'd jeans\nPhiliano Burtono, dog on everything\nYa boy Philiano is OTC\nAnd as a boy I'd shop out this country\nYa boy Philiano got his own clothing\nWhat's

It's named after me\nYou ain't gotta stay tuned, this ain't a cartoon\nSon, where in apartments Burtono, it's coming soon\nRed, white, blue, that's so fresh\nBlack on black, you look like a mess\nThe funny part about it, I'm so funny\nI'm so fresh to death, I sweat money\nI love it, chillin' in the public\n300 bucks for the Rock & Republics\nI don't know, but I'm not the best\nI stay, I'm just tryna impress\nBut just get fresh\n\n\nI go to Beverly Hills for perfection\nJust so I can scope out the new Polo Hanson\nMy own clothing gives me an erection\nI like to jack off to my own clothing\nNigga, check my wallet and see how much I'm holding\nA new Bathing Ape t-shirt I'm unfolding\nCuffed pants, Bloxhead main attraction\nWhere my jeans now have a creative reaction\nWhen my jeans get ripped up from my crew\nProbably because my new printing label look blue\nOrange, yellow, green, pink I got fits\nMy closet has thicker silicone than Lil Kim's tits\nAnd as you could tell I'm on a mission\n'Cause I got more True Religion than a Christian\nI'm rockin in public, Banana Republic\nYou rockin Akademik jeans? I'm rockin Rock & Republic\n(????) My flow is sicker than (???) havin sex\nAnd you know what's next, I'm one of the best\nYes, I'm not even gonna tell you the rest\nMy nigga get fresh\n\nOooh, yeah"}}, {"title": "Glitter", "album": "Flower Boy", "year": "2017-07-21", "lyrics": "Da na na na na, da na na na na\nDa na na na na, my baby\nYou've been on my mind (How ya feel?)\nI'm losing my mind because\nI hope that we can be more than just friends\n\nFirework, I feel like glitter\nAnd every time you come around, I feel like glitter (How ya feel?)\nYou're the one that I needed in my life (How ya feel?)\nYou're the one that I needed in my life\n\nAyo, mirror mirror on the wall, who the brightest of them all?\nI never been the darkest one 'cause my self esteem is tall\nSo I never seen eye-to-eye with y'all niggas, ayo\nUno peso, never paid attention to what niggas gotta say-o\nSo I keep that buck, I ain't give no fuck\nThey ain't build me up so I block 'em like Lego\nFeelin' glitter, feelin' good and great\nGot the burner, got the heat, like wait\nGot the shit, it's all up on that hip\nI'll use it on myself on the day you dip\nGot that 4, 5, 7, track 8 for me\nBaby doll, I hope you agree\nBecause you light my\n\nFirework, I feel like glitter\nAnd every time you come around, I feel like glitter\n(How you feel?)

You don't even have the balls to begin with. What you need is me, someone to talk to, uh, it's been a while since our last session. So, tell me what's been going on\n\nI'm not a fucking role model (I know this)\nI'm a 19 year old fucking emotional coaster with pipe dreams\nSince Kanye tweeted telling people he's bumping all of my shit\nThese mothafuckas think I'm 'sposed to live up to something? Shit\nI'm still jacking off and proceeding my life careless\nBut getting more pussy cause I tell bitches I'm Wood Harris (as you should)\nPhilly to Paris, I'm getting these weird stares\nAt skateparks and airports all in a year, it's weird\nYonkers dropped and left them craniums mindfucked\nNow competition missing like that nigga my mom fucked\nHe still hasn't called me yet (that's not your fault)\nBut that's a whole fucking different argument, shit, I got over it\nAnd a couple bucks in my pocket, so now I could go buy\nA couple hot pockets and grandma could stop cooking\nThem nasty ass collard greens, pressure's on me like this top hat\nBastard intro, how the fuck I'm gonna top that?\n\n\"Tyler, you'll top it, you'll top that, you're a very capable individual\"\n\"Okay, you guys caught me, I'm not a fucking rapist or serial killer, I lied\"\n\"You know, you just want attention, you'll be fine\"\n\"I try too hard, huh?\"\n\"No, you don't\"\n\nMade a couple thou' and I just don't know what to buy yet\nThe 'preme shit is free and I don't drink, so fuck a wine set\nNigga, fuck a mindset, my brain is an obscenity\nI'm fucked in the head, I lost my mind with my virginity\nOh, that's a triple three six, isn't he a devil worshiper\nCause I'm too fucking ignorant to do some research?\nI'm the star of the group (Yeah)\nSo no one else gets the respect that they deserve cause of you\n(Bastard was good though) What you think I record it for?\nTo have a bunch a critics call my shit a bunch of horrorcore?\nLike I didn't make \"Parade\" or \"Inglorious\"\nCause I'm too scared to tell my friends the way I really fucking feel?\nOf course they only listen to lyrics about me pissin' off\nIn the tombs of Lara Croft, I'm getting pissed off (I bet)\nMessage boards are on my dick, I need a pissing waiver (here)\nLet me bust one in they mouth, I know they full of flavor\n\n\"Can't they just be happy for me like, a kid with nothing, living out his dreams? Why they got to fucking hate?\"\n\"I think everyone's happy, everyone's immature, everyone loves you Tyler, you have to believe that.\"\n\"I don't even skate anymore, I'm too fucking busy, I can barely kickflip now.\"\n\"Why? Why is that? Do you not have any free time at your home?\"\n\"What the fuck you mean I'm not talented? You see the shit that I've been doing?\"\n\"I have, I mean you're a great person.\"\n\"I mean, I'm not that great of a rapper but as a whole, I'm pretty cool, right?\"\n\nPeople excited, thinking shit is so tight (For what?)\nGetting co-signs from rappers that I don't even like\nWhat the fuck you want me to do? Start to gobble his mic?\nAnd start Jackson him off until his cack blasting off? (No...)\nFuck that, (Yeah) These niggas ain't fucking with me\nCause I don't listen to the Immortal of Tech-of-the-nique\nAnd all this underground bullshit that's never gon' peak\nOn the Billboard Top 20 and Jam of the Week\nI'd rather listen to Badu and Pusha the T\nAnd some Waka Flocka Flame instead (All that shit) of that real hip hop\nThat's bull-of-the-sheet, but they want to critique\nEverything that we, Wolf Gang, has ever released\nBut they don't get it, (They don't, it's not made for them) cause it's not made for them\nThe nigga that's in the mirror rapping, it's made for him\nBut they do not have the mindset that's same as him\nI'm not weird, you're just a faggot, shame on him\n\n\"It is, but Tyler, you're going to have to cut down on that \"faggot\" word, that's very, that's a bad...\n\"I'm not homophobic.\"\n\"I mean, I don't think you are but...\"\n\"Faggot.\"\n\"Alright, well, since the last time we...\"\n\"The fuck is a good performance? I get on stage and I have as much fun as I can.\"\n\"I mean, you, you, it seems like you have fun. But your Twitter posts, just..

You don't even have the balls to begin with. What you need is me, someone to talk to, uh, it's been a while since our last session. So, tell me what's been going on\n\nI'm not a fucking role model (I know this)\nI'm a 19 year old fucking emotional coaster with pipe dreams\nSince Kanye tweeted telling people he's bumping all of my shit\nThese mothafuckas think I'm 'sposed to live up to something? Shit\nI'm still jacking off and proceeding my life careless\nBut getting more pussy cause I tell bitches I'm Wood Harris (as you should)\nPhilly to Paris, I'm getting these weird stares\nAt skateparks and airports all in a year, it's weird\nYonkers dropped and left them craniums mindfucked\nNow competition missing like that nigga my mom fucked\nHe still hasn't called me yet (that's not your fault)\nBut that's a whole fucking different argument, shit, I got over it\nAnd a couple bucks in my pocket, so now I could go buy\nA couple hot pockets and grandma could stop cooking\nThem nasty ass collard greens, pressure's on me like this top hat\nBastard intro, how the fuck I'm gonna top that?\n\n\"Tyler, you'll top it, you'll top that, you're a very capable individual\"\n\"Okay, you guys caught me, I'm not a fucking rapist or serial killer, I lied\"\n\"You know, you just want attention, you'll be fine\"\n\"I try too hard, huh?\"\n\"No, you don't\"\n\nMade a couple thou' and I just don't know what to buy yet\nThe 'preme shit is free and I don't drink, so fuck a wine set\nNigga, fuck a mindset, my brain is an obscenity\nI'm fucked in the head, I lost my mind with my virginity\nOh, that's a triple three six, isn't he a devil worshiper\nCause I'm too fucking ignorant to do some research?\nI'm the star of the group (Yeah)\nSo no one else gets the respect that they deserve cause of you\n(Bastard was good though) What you think I record it for?\nTo have a bunch a critics call my shit a bunch of horrorcore?\nLike I didn't make \"Parade\" or \"Inglorious\"\nCause I'm too scared to tell my friends the way I really fucking feel?\nOf course they only listen to lyrics about me pissin' off\nIn the tombs of Lara Croft, I'm getting pissed off (I bet)\nMessage boards are on my dick, I need a pissing waiver (here)\nLet me bust one in they mouth, I know they full of flavor\n\n\"Can't they just be happy for me like, a kid with nothing, living out his dreams? Why they got to fucking hate?\"\n\"I think everyone's happy, everyone's immature, everyone loves you Tyler, you have to believe that.\"\n\"I don't even skate anymore, I'm too fucking busy, I can barely kickflip now.\"\n\"Why? Why is that? Do you not have any free time at your home?\"\n\"What the fuck you mean I'm not talented? You see the shit that I've been doing?\"\n\"I have, I mean you're a great person.\"\n\"I mean, I'm not that great of a rapper but as a whole, I'm pretty cool, right?\"\n\nPeople excited, thinking shit is so tight (For what?)\nGetting co-signs from rappers that I don't even like\nWhat the fuck you want me to do? Start to gobble his mic?\nAnd start Jackson him off until his cack blasting off? (No...)\nFuck that, (Yeah) These niggas ain't fucking with me\nCause I don't listen to the Immortal of Tech-of-the-nique\nAnd all this underground bullshit that's never gon' peak\nOn the Billboard Top 20 and Jam of the Week\nI'd rather listen to Badu and Pusha the T\nAnd some Waka Flocka Flame instead (All that shit) of that real hip hop\nThat's bull-of-the-sheet, but they want to critique\nEverything that we, Wolf Gang, has ever released\nBut they don't get it, (They don't, it's not made for them) cause it's not made for them\nThe nigga that's in the mirror rapping, it's made for him\nBut they do not have the mindset that's same as him\nI'm not weird, you're just a faggot, shame on him\n\n\"It is, but Tyler, you're going to have to cut down on that \"faggot\" word, that's very, that's a bad...\n\"I'm not homophobic.\"\n\"I mean, I don't think you are but...\"\n\"Faggot.\"\n\"Alright, well, since the last time we...\"\n\"The fuck is a good performance? I get on stage and I have as much fun as I can.\"\n\"I mean, you, you, it seems like you have fun. But your Twitter posts, just.. I mean, they're really random and it's ADD.\"\n\"Who doesn't have ADD..? Well, I don't.\"\n\"I mean, sometimes, you're just really out in the distance and we just want to know, what's the problem for this?\"\n\"I wish Thebe was here.\"\n\nTherapy's been sinning and niggas getting offended\nThey don't want to fuck with me cause I do not fuck with religion\nYou see, that's my decision, you fuckers don't have to listen\nHere, put this middle finger in your ear (I'd rather not)\nWhen someone gets blamed cause some white kid had aimed (What?) his AK-47\nAt 47 kids, I don't wanna see my name mentioned\n(I don't think anyone's going to men\u2014I don't think anyone takes you serious enough to believe you.)\nCollege wasn't working and I wasn't working\nSo I was at home jerking off until my dick was hurting\nBut I was determined to be great, so those classes can wait\nCause the four days that I went, I wasn't learning shit (I mean, you...)\nNow I'm living dreams that I wanted since eight\nAnd can afford to get my mother something on her birthday\n(I mean, you've explained to me that you were in school, but, I mean, I...)\nThey claim the shit I say is just wrong\nLike nobody has those really dark thoughts when alone\nI'm just a teenager, who admits he's suicide prone\nMy life is doing pretty good, so that date is postponed for now\nWow, life's a cute bitch full of estrogen\nAnd when she gives you lemons, nigga, throw 'em at pedestrians\n(So, what are you saying, take advantage?\nI mean, you've been doing pretty good, I've seen that)\nI still live in my grandma's house\nSell out a fucking show in London just to end up on couches\nI hate my fucking life, but when I make that announcement\nMy hero calls my phone, just to put that in doubt then\nAnd then I am confused if I want in or just out\nMy friends really think I'm playing when I say I need counseling\nI sit in grandmother's living room and just pout\nAnd shout loud inside, sometimes I just want to die (No, you don't)\nOdd Future came from the bottom\nAnd it's gonna take a couple armed armies tryna stop 'em\n(I believe you) All you fucking lames don't have to like me\nThe devil doesn't wear Prada, I'm clearly in a fucking white tee\n\nWhoa, umm, alright, uh, so Syd was telling me you went to New York..."}}, {"title": "Goblin [Tracklist + Album Art]", "album": "Goblin", "year": "2011-05-10", "lyrics": "Tracklist\n1.

I mean, you--not like you don't have anyone to talk to...\nI'm here for you, I'm your friend\nWhen I say Odd, y'all say Future\nOdd... Uh-uh, nah, that shit's corny as fuck, fuck!\nTyler, you're doin' good. You have a cult following, you're-\nTo these white kids?\nOh, my gosh\n\nCharbroiled nigga on these dark beats\nNauseous with the Nazi but it's normal what the cops see\nAwesome at his concert, but he never had a pop, see\nMommy was a living single queen with a lat ti\nSo while my wallets piling with symbolic colored paper\nI lace her, cause she gave me such a lot at such a young age\n20, why didn't she get that abortion?\nProbably cause that motherfuckin embryo was morphing\nInto a Grammy-winning schizophrenic fucking orphan\nOops, I mean bastard, skinny-ass disaster\nMom works hard, still working on her masters\nSon lies about taking classes at community college\nJust to record some bullshit he calls Bastard\nStart a fuckin cult, clash his talents in a brash way\nBefore he even had a mustache and cash\nAnd all I got was a fucking shitty article in Thrasher\n\n\"Alright, just calm down\"\n\"That ain\u2019t shit, man\"\n\"Now don\u2019t, don\u2019t, don\u2019t make yourself seem guilty.

gotta say?\"\n\nMom is getting jealous, I see my manager more\nThan I see her before I go on tour and it hurts\nI miss the days when this was fun, but now it turned into work\nAnd getting legal, so I got to watch the shit that I blurt out (As you should, that shit's outrageous...)\nMy friends are turning into opposites\nBecause my life is turning into opposite of sloppy wrist\nAnd all the bitches who forgot about me want to ride my dick\nHarder than the white kids who copy shit\nEnding it is all I fucking think about, that's the shit I think about\nAll alone, bawling 'til my motherfucking eyes bleed\nSee, he's a leader in person and smile, shit gets disgursting\nWhen there's no person around, talking discussion shit, man, fuck\n(I'm here to talk to you) I'm putting myself at a distance\nFor instance, my best friend is now my fucking assistant (Who, Travis?)\nNiggas saying \"Free Earl\" without even knowin' him\nSee, they're missing a new album, I'm missing my only friend\n\nYou have everyone around you, with... thirty names a day?\nI don't see what it is? I mean, you--not like you don't have anyone to talk to...\nI'm here for you, I'm your friend\nWhen I say Odd, y'all say Future\nOdd... Uh-uh, nah, that shit's corny as fuck, fuck!\nTyler, you're doin' good. You have a cult following, you're-\nTo these white kids?\nOh, my gosh\n\nCharbroiled nigga on these dark beats\nNauseous with the Nazi but it's normal what the cops see\nAwesome at his concert, but he never had a pop, see\nMommy was a living single queen with a lat ti\nSo while my wallets piling with symbolic colored paper\nI lace her, cause she gave me such a lot at such a young age\n20, why didn't she get that abortion?\nProbably cause that motherfuckin embryo was morphing\nInto a Grammy-winning schizophrenic fucking orphan\nOops, I mean bastard, skinny-ass disaster\nMom works hard, still working on her masters\nSon lies about taking classes at community college\nJust to record some bullshit he calls Bastard\nStart a fuckin cult, clash his talents in a brash way\nBefore he even had a mustache and cash\nAnd all I got was a fucking shitty article in Thrasher\n\n\"Alright, just calm down\"\n\"That ain\u2019t shit, man\"\n\"Now don\u2019t, don\u2019t, don\u2019t make yourself seem guilty. That, that article was great\"\n\"No, fuck that, nigga\"\n\"You're beating yourself up and your living the fucking life right now, kid! When I was your age, I would have loved to be fucking doing the things that you're doing right now\"\n\"Fuck that\u2026 fuck all this shit\"\n\"You, you, you act like I\u2019m not here\"\n\"You're not\"\n\"I'm exactly who you\u2019re supposed to be talking to\"\n\"You don\u2019t fucking help me with shit\nYou don\u2019t help me with shit, fuck!\"\n\"Yeah, you get... that, that\u2014who wouldn\u2019t do that?\"\n\"Fuck you! Fuck you!\"\n\"Who wouldn\u2019t, who wouldn't shoot their friend?\"\n\"Old fucking fuck!\"\n\"That\u2019s fine, it\u2019s not your fault\"\n\"I killed my fucking friends... fuck!\"\n\"I\u2019m gonna need security in here, and, uh\u2026\"\n\"Fuck! I didn't fucking sign up for this shit!\nI'm, I'm not fucking crazy\u2014I'm a fucking table! I'm a fucking table!\"\n\"Yes, come quick. He\u2019s losing it\"\n\"No, fuck this shit!\"\n\"Tyler, calm down\"\n\nI'mma grab the Nina (No!) and find a nice arena\nCause I can\u2019t even choose between Ortega or Sabrina (Get security in here.)\nAnd I\u2019m not even human, I\u2019m a body shaped demon\nWith some semen in my sack and some problems in the back (Calm the fuck down!)\nAnd a life that\u2019s fill with crap, and a finger filled with hate\nAnd a gat that\u2019s filled with love, now let opposites attract\nI can finally be one (No!) like a marriage in a church\nBut this marriage has a hearse and the parents of the one\nThat\u2019s getting married has a curse and it\u2019s made up inside of him\nToo late to reimburse but, wait, it gets worse!\nAll the guests that\u2019s in the church all decided to disperse (Tyler...)\nSo there was nobody who could stop the wedding with converse (You don't want to do this...)\nSo they tied the knot, now it\u2019s too late to reverse\nThis arrangement (Yes, it is) and the nurse is amazed\nAat the hurt that he was painting (Calm the fuck down!)\nBut it was obvious in all the photos he was paining\nNow a bunch of whispering immerse\n\n\"Yeah, he's right there. Security's right there.\"\n\"Shit! No, get away from me.\"\n\"Get him.\"\nAnd then the nurse blurts\n(\"Come here.\")\n\"What the fuck is his problem? Here, we have two doses to give him, here\"\nWhy didn\u2019t anybody ask him first?\n(\"Get on the ground!\") \"Hold him down.\"\n\"I\u2019ve been asking you this whole time, Tyler...\"\n\"Get the fuck away from me! Get away from me!\" (\"Come here, motherfucker!\")\nBecause nobody gave a fuck\n\"Get the fuck off of me...\"\nSomeone gave a fuck Tyler\nAnd, uh... the person that gave a fuck was me\nSee, you\u2019re not, going crazy... it\u2019s me. I\u2019m your best friend, Tyler\nI know everything, I know everything about you\nYou\u2019ve been helping yourself this whole time. Your friends? They\u2019re just figments of your imagination\nDr. TC... See Tyler, I\u2019m your conscience\nI\u2019m Tron Cat, I\u2019m Ace, I\u2019m Wolf Haley, I\u2019m...

back\nI lift them wrinkles up\nDon't make me soft\nOur age difference\nA big deal, but if\nYou let me eat your ass\nThen you can suck my dick\nStop playing girl\nAnd come here cause\nI'm already hard\n\nGirl, I know you wanna\nFuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuck me\nStop playing around now\n\nI'm hungry\nNow I'm lonely\nI need your pussy\nDon't keep me starving\nI'm hungry\nNow I'm lonely\nI need your

No Matter How Crazy And Offensive Or Weird My Ideas Were, They Put Their Trust In Me And Allowed Me To Move Forward.Like Dude, We Threw A Fucking Carnival In The Middle Of Los Angeles With 10k Plus People. We Didn't Have Any Crazy Sponsors And I Didn't Have To Suck Up to Anyone Or Any Of That Shit, WE Did It. And The Skatepark? Did You See That Skatepark? I Was Up Till 2 Am Painting That Bitch! Growing Up In Hawthorne At The Dirty ( skatepark) And Seeing My Old Friends From There Getting Clips Was Prolly The Craziest Shit Ive Seen. How Far Ive Came With Every Little Idea that I Believed In No Matter Who Did Or Didn't. Walking Around Seeing Kids In EXACT Things That I Wear Is Mind Blowing. Something That I Just Naturally Like And Put On, Its Some Kid Out There That Studies Every Article Of Clothing That Was Put On And Emulates That. Thats Crazy To Me. I Used To Do That With P, So Know That Someone IS Looking At Me The Way I Look At Him Is Really Amazing To Me\nI Didn't Think I Would Change So Many Lives. Someone Retweeted An Old Tweet Of Mine From Feb 2012 Yesterday And It Read \u2019 I Had A Dream That Kanye Invited Me To Perform LATE With Him. I Wish\u2019. Kanye Came To The Carnival And I Performed Late With Him. My Favorite Song By Kanye, AN Album Cut He NEVER Does, Was Performed Not Only With But During My Set And My Carnival! No Matter if You Hate Me Think Im Stupid Untalented Annoying Or Whatever, I FUCKING WIN AND YOU CAN SUCK MY WHOLE SHIT. We Did This, OF Did This, Coming From Actually Jack Shit And Turned That Jack Shit In Something. I\u2019m Just Blabbing Now. I Just Want Who Ever Reading This To Know That Anything Is Possible, No Matter How Crazy It May Seem, Anything IS Possible You Just Have To Figure It Out. Get Your Self Esteem Up And Like Yourself, Then Like Your Ideas. We Live In A World Where People Dont Even Like Their Own Ideas, That Why You Have People Copying One Thing Thats Working So Much, Then Everything Gets Over Saturated With The Same Shit, And That Goes With Fashion, Music And All That. If People Actually Loved Themselves And Believed In Themselves More You Know How Many More Crazy Things Would Be Created? There Is No Fucking Limit To Anything! ( Except Elevators)\nIts A World Of People Who Dont Give A Fuck About The Mall Or The Radio Or None Of That Shit, Who Dont Care About Race Or If Someone Is Gay Or What Not. Thats What I Was Trying To Say On That Arsenio Interview. I Prolly Came Of As An Idiot Tho. Im Really Passionate About Everything I Do. From Music To Clothing To Videos. I Love Make Videos So Much. I Just Want Some Millionaire To Throw Me Money To Be Creative And Get Shots. I Remember Kids In School Always Thought I Was Weird, Not Just Cause How I Dressed Or The Music I Liked Or That Fact I Was Just Different Overall( in comparison to them), But Because I Was So Open With Future Goals. I Would Always Say The Grammies Im Gonna Get, And The Number 1 Movie Im Going To Write And Direct, And Just Random Shit Im Gonna Do. Now Those Same Dude Who Shut Me Down Are Paying Shitty College Debt Doing Something They Hate, Because They Didn't Go Full Throttle On Their Own Dreams And Quickly Shitted On Mines. And Im Not Knocking Anyone In College, Please Get Your Education, Im Just Saying, Do What You Love And Be Happy, Dont Live For Anyone Else. I Dont Like The Color Black. I Dont Know What That Has To Do With Anything But I Like Colors, Bright Colors, Like Flowers. It Brings A Great Energy\nOk Im Just Talking Again. Its Prolly A lot Of Typos In This But Im Just Going Off Of What Ever Is Coming To My Head. This Photo Of Na-Kel Smith Skating In Front Of The GOLF Mural At The Skatepark Means So Much To Me. The World Is Yours Little Nigga, And I Mean That. They Are Them, We Are Us, Fuck Them All!

Kanye Came To The Carnival And I Performed Late With Him. My Favorite Song By Kanye, AN Album Cut He NEVER Does, Was Performed Not Only With But During My Set And My Carnival! No Matter if You Hate Me Think Im Stupid Untalented Annoying Or Whatever, I FUCKING WIN AND YOU CAN SUCK MY WHOLE SHIT. We Did This, OF Did This, Coming From Actually Jack Shit And Turned That Jack Shit In Something. I\u2019m Just Blabbing Now. I Just Want Who Ever Reading This To Know That Anything Is Possible, No Matter How Crazy It May Seem, Anything IS Possible You Just Have To Figure It Out. Get Your Self Esteem Up And Like Yourself, Then Like Your Ideas. We Live In A World Where People Dont Even Like Their Own Ideas, That Why You Have People Copying One Thing Thats Working So Much, Then Everything Gets Over Saturated With The Same Shit, And That Goes With Fashion, Music And All That. If People Actually Loved Themselves And Believed In Themselves More You Know How Many More Crazy Things Would Be Created? There Is No Fucking Limit To Anything! ( Except Elevators)\nIts A World Of People Who Dont Give A Fuck About The Mall Or The Radio Or None Of That Shit, Who Dont Care About Race Or If Someone Is Gay Or What Not. Thats What I Was Trying To Say On That Arsenio Interview. I Prolly Came Of As An Idiot Tho. Im Really Passionate About Everything I Do. From Music To Clothing To Videos. I Love Make Videos So Much. I Just Want Some Millionaire To Throw Me Money To Be Creative And Get Shots. I Remember Kids In School Always Thought I Was Weird, Not Just Cause How I Dressed Or The Music I Liked Or That Fact I Was Just Different Overall( in comparison to them), But Because I Was So Open With Future Goals. I Would Always Say The Grammies Im Gonna Get, And The Number 1 Movie Im Going To Write And Direct, And Just Random Shit Im Gonna Do. Now Those Same Dude Who Shut Me Down Are Paying Shitty College Debt Doing Something They Hate, Because They Didn't Go Full Throttle On Their Own Dreams And Quickly Shitted On Mines. And Im Not Knocking Anyone In College, Please Get Your Education, Im Just Saying, Do What You Love And Be Happy, Dont Live For Anyone Else. I Dont Like The Color Black. I Dont Know What That Has To Do With Anything But I Like Colors, Bright Colors, Like Flowers. It Brings A Great Energy\nOk Im Just Talking Again. Its Prolly A lot Of Typos In This But Im Just Going Off Of What Ever Is Coming To My Head. This Photo Of Na-Kel Smith Skating In Front Of The GOLF Mural At The Skatepark Means So Much To Me. The World Is Yours Little Nigga, And I Mean That. They Are Them, We Are Us, Fuck Them All!

yeah yeah\nAlright\n(It's this girl)\n\nShe lives next door, to the store that I loiter at\nWe talk every night, she cry to me about her guy\nAnd if we text I get pissed when I get no reply (It's this girl)\nI know that she's the key to love\nShe is who I'm thinking of when I am beating Richard up\nTo mental images her face look\nThe closest that I got was when I'm poking her on Facebook (This girl)\nVideo chats are so exciting\nCause it's like she is inviting me to her world full of privacy\nI'm getting gassed up, I think she's liking me\nShe's gullible and I just wanna take it like a pirate (It's this girl)\nI see her in class\nNot really, two doors down, but anytime that I pass\nTo take a piss in a stall, I picture us in the hall\nLocking lips on the wall, her hand grabbing my dick\nMy left hand on her tits, ah my shit's getting hard\nFrom thoughts of dating this bitch (It's this girl)\nHer name is my passwords, fuck (This girl)\n\nAll my niggas got they bitches and stuff\nBut all the bitches they fuck, are known as bitches and sluts\nBut she's special, I know to y'all I come off as rough\nBut I'm the nicest to her, and I just want to concur\nA relation, I want the cheesy dates at the movies\nAnd stupid walks at the beach, and sharing straws in a cup\nI never had that, so when we holding hands walking home\nI look past that, the fact that she's fucking guys that I hate (This girl)\nBut, things are looking great, cut copy\nLast time we talked she said that her relationship was rocky (Action)\nNow that Mr. Fag is gone, there's no one that can stop me\nFrom bagging her, I got these tickets to the Roxy (Girl)\nNext day, metro's taking me home\nI see her in the cut at Wendy's, but she's not alone\nWho's that guy? Wait, why the fuck he 'bout to kiss her?\nCome to find out she got back with her nigga\nDamn, fuck (It's this girl)\n\nShe's so pretty\nFuck self-pity, I feel so shitty\nI wanna text her in a jealous rage\nBut if she reply to say anything, I'ma smile, I know\nWhat do I do with myself, sit in my room for some days\nPlay Xbox and piles full of wet socks? Fuck that (Girl)\n\nMy nigga ask, \"Ace, what happened to such and such?\"\nI could slander her name, and then tell him I probably fucked\nOr I could tell him the truth and just say she ain't like me much\nBut instead, I lie and say she moved to Nebraska\n\n(It's this girl)\nBut she's not mine"}}, {"title": "Herpes On My Lip", "album": "Odd Future Unreleased Volume 4 ", "year": null, "lyrics": "Herpes on my lip, I got herpes on my..\nHerpes on my lip, I got herpes on my..\nHerpes on my lip, grandma got herpes on her..\n\nYou got full blown AIDS, I got full blown crabs\nYou got full blown AIDS, I caught it from your dad\nHe gave me kiss so I call the cops\nNot to tell nobody, they gave me money and a lollipop\nMy name is Bob, your real name is Charm\nI hate Myspace, nigga fuck a Tom\nYou gotta fidget, get up in it in my video\nThere's gon' be transsexual Cambodian midgets\n\nHerpes on my lip, I got herpes on my..\nHerpes on my lip, I got herpes on my..\nHerpes on my lip, grandma got herpes on her..\n\nYou like my clothes, you like my shirt\nYou like my purse, my girlfriend got a flat chest\nMustache, flat ass, no hair\nChicken head weave wearing dirty underwear\nRogue Status: fresh Nikes\nNice bikes, skateboard no\nNice dikes\nI got a cat,, you got a frog..\nYou got a girlfriend, my girlfriend is a frog\n\nHerpes on my lip, I got herpes on my..\nHerpes on my lip, I got herpes on my..\nHe dont like the Herpes on my lip, thats why he sent me that message\n\nThis is dedicated to all the beautiful people in the world\nAnd all the fat girls\nOdd Future", "image": "https://images.rapgenius.com/133587dfd0c4f3581137a5d12b944067.500x500x1.jpg", "artist": "Tyler, The Creator", "raw": {"annotation_count": 9, "api_path": "/songs/68578", "description": {"dom": {"tag": "root", "children": [{"tag": "p", "children": ["\u201cHerpes On My Lip\u201d is an early Tyler, the Creator track about, you guessed it, having herpes on his lips.

got hectic whenever I fought back\nFor example, ten minutes can't go past without you brushing my thoughts\nThat's fourteen forty a day so I'll say a hundred and forty four times\nI think about you or something like that\nLost match, the fucking thought of you with somebody else\nI don't like that; cellular convos getting left in the wrong\nCause I get so fucking mad when you don't write back\nThis isn't a song, I just happen to rhyme when I get emo\nAnd find time to write facts (fuck)\nI love you\nCan we add some more color, um, like, some more, yellow\nYeah, that's good\n\nI fucking hate you\nBut I love you\nI'm bad at keeping my emotions bubbled\nYou're good at being perfect\nWe're good at being troubled, yeah\nI fucking hate you\nBut I love you\nI'm bad at keeping my emotions bubbled\nYou're good at being perfect\nWe're good at being troubled, yeah\n\nGirl, you fucking with my emotions\nThe fuck is all this noise about?\nI even considered picking up smoking\nYou turned to a bitch, who let the dogs out?\nBut in my dog house\nMy bitch is the raddest\nCrazy who makes me the happiest\nCan make me the saddest\nLook Alice\nLet's get lost in your wonder-er-land fuck an atlas\nYou're perfectly perfect for me\nWhat the fuck is this, practice?\nActually, if you even consider leaving\nI'll lose a couple screws in due time, I'll stop breathing\nAnd you'll see the meaning of stalking\nWhen I pop out the dark to find you\nAnd that new dude that you're seeing with an attitude\nThen proceed to fuck up your evening\nMake sure you never meet again like goddamn vegans\nCause when I hear your name I can not stop cheesing\nI love you so much that my heart stops beating when you're leaving\nAnd I'm grieving and my heart starts bleeding\nLife without you has no goddamn meaning\nSorry\u2014I'm passive-aggressive for no goddamn reason\nIt's that my mood change like these goddamn seasons\nI'll fall for you, but I love you\nI'm bad at keeping my emotions bubbled\nYou're good at being perfect\nWe're good at being troubled\nYeah\n\nThe sky's falling girl, let's try to catch it\nThe sky's falling girl, let's try to catch it\nThe sky's falling girl, let's try to catch it tonight\nThe sky's falling girl, let's try to catch it\nThe sky's falling girl, let's try to catch it\nThe sky's falling bitch, let's try to catch it tonight\n\nC'mon baby\nEven though I hate you\nI still love you\nI love you\nAnd Salem, my love (I know)\nI'm passive aggressive (I'm sorry, fuck)\n(Come here)\nI like when we hold hands\n(You're the best around)\nSee I get jealous (fuck)\nAnd if I see that nigga (If I see him)\nI just might kill him (look)\n(Look. I wanna strangle you, till you stop breathing)\nLove, love, love\n(Spend the rest of my life, looking for air)\n(so you can breathe, or we can die together, you and me)\n(Fuck, look)\nI'm in love (Love)\n\nI fucking hate you\nBut I love you\nI'm bad at keeping my emotions bubbled\nYou're good at being perfect\nWe're good at being troubled, yeah\nI fucking hate you\nBut I love you\nI'm bad at keeping my emotions bubbled\nYou're good at being perfect\nWe're good at being troubled, yeah\n\n\"Yo, why is Samuel such a fucking dick?\"\n\"He isn't such a badass actually.

we end this?\n\nMy father died the day I came out of my mother's hole\nAnd left a burden on my soul, until I was old enough\nTo understand that the fuckin' faggot didn't like me much\nHe loved my moms enough to bust a nut and then he Shake Junt\nBring your pops to school day, for twelve years, I cheated\nTold the fuckin' faculty that he was at a meetin' and\nBring that dude to life day, he wasn't at the meetin'\nMade a U-turn on the way there like; \"the fuck am I thinkin'\"\nBirthdays, Christmas, my only fuckin' wishlist\nWas CDs (and a father) and a new fitted\nInstead I got some CDs, inhaler, some Ritalin, some white socks\nI was hyper, 'cause I didn't get attention from my real pops\nCops say I'm supposed to be in jail, but they don't know it's me\nStatistics say that niggas with no father ain't gon' be shit (nigga)\nWell I guess I had one because nigga I'm it\nYou smell that? (Yeah!) That's the odor of success, bitch\n\nI know I'm not the only bastard in America\nSo I'm gon' to need some help, on this next part\nScream it with me, niggas\n\nFuck you (I'm good)\nFuck you (I graduated)\nWithout you (I'm good)\nFuck you (I'm good)\nNigga, eighteen (I'm good)\nFuck you (I'm good)\nGot a car, nigga (fuck you)\nEat a dick, nigga, bitch\n\nFather's Day was the worst when it came to gifts\n'Cause I ain't know for who or what the fuck to get\nNow my momma mentioned the day before what she would like\n'Cause she's playin' both roles, like her occupation was dyke, fuckin' right\nI ain't look up to Obama and Nixon\nI look up to the Hugos and Dixons\nThe niggas in the vision rap about the shit they cookin' in the kitchen\nPushin' keys, like them niggas that were bangin' on the keys\nMy father never seen me, the nigga probably Stevie\nHe bought me a hoodie, a couple albums\nLike that's gon' make up for the years and the tears\nAnd the money that my momma spent on rent and clothes\nYou fuckin' dipped out, I swear to God, if I see you\nI'm a get out the M-16 and let a fuckin' clip out (RRRAAA!)\n'Cause in 16 years, you let your kid doubt the existence, none\nI don't give a fuck either, like father, like son, I'm done\n\nHe ain't give a fuck about me\nHe ain't give a fuck about you\nHe ain't give a fuck about we\nSo what the fuck we gon' do?\n\nFuck you (I'm good)\nFuck you (I graduated)\nWithout you (I'm good)\nFuck you (I'm good)\nNigga, eighteen (I'm good)\nFuck you (I'm good)\nGot a car, nigga (fuck you)\nEat a dick, nigga, bitch\n\nThe cold is nice, and I'm not talkin' 'bout the weather\nThe skin is thick, no need for leather, your father called\nHe said you're better without him, I'm not the only fuck\nWithout them, how to tie a tie and how to get your suit hemmed up\nTake it to the shop, then what?\nFuck it, momma's proud of her asthmatic, thin fuck\nLuck on my brim, Supreme keeps me warm\nWhen the cold blood swarms in my veins, fuck rain in the summer\nThe bummer is the fact that I'm black\nAnd I hang with white Neos whose marrow stays frio\nNow this counselor is tryna tell me that I'm emo\nShe don't give a fuck\nD-low where's the trigger? I'll let this bullet play hero\n\nNah, fuck this\nI don't deserve this shit\nI'm over it\nBANG!"}}, {"title": "In My Mind 10 Years Anniversary Letter", "album": null, "year": "2016-07-25", "lyrics": "I was 15 attending summer school at Hawthorne High, spending most of my nights trying to find any snippets of the album on various German sites.

go hiking\nOn a fuckin' mountain where the water fountains icing\nStand there in a tank top prop that's from Baywatch\nAnd eat about four bowls of some frozen ice cream\nGet sick and then I won't have to\nGo to school today, tomorrow, the day after\nSit in bed, write a bunch of raps up\nAnd I won't be lyin' when I say I\u2019m a sick rapper\nI might fail so I won't bother\nThe sun is playin' hide

stop\nPissin' on the demons of the Earth\nWhat\u2019s it really worth? Shit, now it's fuckin' pourin'\nWanted to go skate, can't, now my day is borin', damn\nSnorin' in the bed with blankets cause my head spin\nProbably cause I popped a couple purple Excedrins\nIt's a rainy day, so I'll skip the Led Zeppelin\nAnd play some Sade \"Love Deluxe\" through my headset\nOn my way home I punched a bitch for an umbrella\nWhy? Cause I really didn\u2019t wanna get my shit wet\nRun through the puddles, playin' in the mud\nFun, sucks that I'm too tall for the tub\nOr I would get my toys and make a lotta noise\nWhile my mom is in the kitchen cookin' up a meal\nFire place is startin' up, dick is barely warmin' up\nSippy cup full of whip creamed hot chocolate\n\nI can smell it when I go outside\nThen it just pours\nIt gives us peace then all in the town is quiet\nThat's what rain's for\n\nAll the kids see rain and scream \"No, no\"\nRun off the bus and they will just stay in\nMe I love how rain fills the potholes\nMe and my sailboat, that's what we played in\nEver wonder exactly where the sun goes\nDid it go or did somethin' shade it?\nThe sun gives light cause it is the window\nThe rain gives life cause it is amazin'\n\nLightning is striking, water hittin' on my window like Ike\nI am not Tina, buddy, do not give my window pain\nLights bulbs when wearin' that wig, flyin' kites\nHere's an idea, why don't I go hiking\nOn a fuckin' mountain where the water fountains icing\nStand there in a tank top prop that's from Baywatch\nAnd eat about four bowls of some frozen ice cream\nGet sick and then I won't have to\nGo to school today, tomorrow, the day after\nSit in bed, write a bunch of raps up\nAnd I won't be lyin' when I say I\u2019m a sick rapper\nI might fail so I won't bother\nThe sun is playin' hide and seek like my fuckin' father\nThe only difference is it comes back, full effect\nIn the summer heats up, the thermometers erected\n\nThe inside of clouds\nThat's the window into the sky\nProves there's life"}}, {"title": "Intro", "album": "Radical", "year": "2010-05-07", "lyrics": "Ha ha ha ha!\nWelcome, every-fucking-body\nTo the Odd Future, \"Radical\" carnival. {YOU FUCKIN

just nut\nBitches scared to let me smash on they ass\nYeah, they heard I'm fuckin' nuts like the swag of a fag\nLike me and Tekeli was gagging in the back of the cabin\nCamp Flog Gnaw, nigga, you can tell by the badge\n(Hodgy, pass me my inhaler)\nI'm sick of hacking and coughing, I'm often this fucking awesome\nI'm animal, Noah's arking, all from this rapping nonsense\nFour stories in my home like \"What the fuck's an apartment?\" (nigga?)\nGet shit poppin' like Peter's pores during puberty\nTake bets on how quick Tyler can reach maturity\nCussing out Siri like a waitress with no patience\nOh, you want a tip bitch, well here's my dick for gratiturity, bitch\n\nShut 'em down!\nNigga, shut 'em down!\nShut 'em down!\n\nI tumble-crush on huzzy sluts, give money up then nutty butt\nProfessor Nutty Buddy Klump gets petty when you touch his lunch\nLike, what the fuck? I'm drunk as fuck, turn the fucking music up\nSo I can't hear these stupid fucks, talk-no-walk, let you discuss\nYou're talking too much, Who the fuck are you to us? Uterus\nI put that on my pubes and nuts, if I don't begin moving up\nI'm shooting up, you and her crew on turf, new desert\nI can see the bitch in a nigga through his shirt\nI can smell the whore on a bitch when she walk around my crew to flirt\nIt's on ya' shoulder, lose the dirt, yeah, it's the movement first\nFuck a human nurse! I'm ill I used this earth to infuse the birth\nOf my scrotum on the Channel 10 news, my only motive is to\nSkip to my Lou, get hip to the pew\nYou can drink piss and eat a dick in a few, the sickening view\nOf visuals, woo, I'll eat your ribs, I'm a wolf\nThen meet your kids after school, and give them drugs cause it's cool, fucker\n\nShut 'em down!\nNigga, shut 'em down!\nShut 'em down!\n\nHodgy, fuck this beat, nigga, let's smoke weed\nThat shit I need, be the shit that's green\nA little purple and pink, come get some Swisher Sweets\nAbout three or four more than needed be\nI got a eighth I could face, I got a blunt flavored grape\nI hate the grape, I could taste it when I'm inhaling the vapes\nYou could smell us in places when we walk in our clothing is always covered in flakes\nEnough for two shake blunts; and what the fuck is this? Uh...\nI think this Mary is laced; my heart is beating at paces\nThat Pacquiao can't relate I'm fucking faded like gradients\nShit, I'm stuck like tape that's super glued\nTo the center of Kelly Price first waist\nIt's like my first date with Mrs. Mary, the shit is scary\nThe paranoia from this marijuana's very heavy, I'm lifted\nFainted by my fifth hit, Lionel, pass the sherm\nLet's use the Philly as a dipstick for this bath salt, you dipshit\n\nC'mon, my nigga. You don't even smoke, you weak as fuck, my nigga. You do not smoke, no tucks, my nigga. You're as weak as.. F your butt my nigga. Oh, mark ass nigga, Cuh, oh my God, bro.

Talk to me, man. People worry, we hear stories about you getting into fights and all this unnecessary bullshit. What's on your mind? Talk to me, I'm here\n\nDomo roll another one\nI'm just fuckin' with you I ain't smokin' none\nMy squad bring terror, no intended pun\nMerch booth made niggas extensive funds\nMomma got the Rover with the Range\nShe don't ever ever gotta struggle, not again\nAnd I put that on my dead grandmama's name (rest in peace)\nToo soon\n\nMy nigga Slater, yeah that's my little pony\nLittle homies is repping like I been fucking with Kony\nNigga Phillip and Kobi, to my niggas that know me\nYa boy seem happy as fuck but truthfully ya boy lonely\nNigga's a target for marketing, he's an artist\nCan't even walk into Target without botherin customers botherin\nAsking me for a picture, can I talk to they sister?\nNaw nigga, get lost, you're fucking smothering\nGod I wanna quit, but I can't\nCause mother and sister can't pay the rent\nFour stories with storage, I'm 21 with a mortgage\nAnd touring's paying the bills, life is paying for thrills\nLifes' a bitch bruh but from the third floor man, she's gorgeous\nA year ago I was broke, now how can I afford this?\nI started off with disposables, now I have an assortment\nAnd I'm using these negatives to develop a portrait\nNow the frame is a pain in the ass to get it in\nWithout a scratch or stain on the glass, but that's not important\nJust as long as it's printed, and I hinted it is\nAnd when I get it I'll make sure you get a copy, bitch\nShit I'll even add a signature with the fuckin' pic-ature\nI'll even tell you the film I used, and the aperture\n\nDomo roll another one\nI'm just fuckin' with you I ain't smokin' none\nMy squad bring terror, no intended pun\nMerch booth made niggas extensive funds\nMomma got the Rover with the Range\nShe don't ever ever gotta struggle, not again\nAnd I put that on my dead grandmama's name... Too soon\n\nGrandmother died, didn't cry not a tear\nNot gonna lie, fucking weird no water dripped out the eye\nBut when I got the news, yup it left your boy stuck\nCause when my mom dipped out, she was the one that gave me a fuck\nMom calling and calling, I'm on my way to a show\nI answer, she crying, saying Sadie is dying\nThe doc said she only had a week for us to speak\nBefore she deceased, cause cancer was just eating her cheeks up\nFuck, nah this is really awkward for me, bruh\nI hang the phone up, and adjust my seat back\nAnd started to think, like, \"What the fuck just happened?\"\nI never had a death and I just seen her a week ago\nMeet them at the hospital I should\nIn between the set of BADBADNOTGOOD\nLionel asked what happened I said it's bad bad, not good\nJust take me to the Cedars-Sinai off of Oakwood\nGetting there, family sitting center chair\nAwkward in the lobby, it was floating in the thinning air\nGetting there, need a sticker saying how I got in there, there's a room\nOpen up the curtain, she's just sitting there, hello\nOur conversation's brief, couldn't even make eye contact when we speak\nLookin' at her you could tell all she had was weak\nAnd I'm not talkin' days bruh, I'm talkin' 'bout her strength\nI sat there 20 minutes tops, hoping it was just a fucking plea that she could cop\nShe died that night\n\nDr. TC: Oh, that's heavy man, I'm sorry for your loss\nTyler: Yeah, whatever, don't worry about it...\nDr. TC: Last time I seen Sammy, he was lookin' for you\nTyler: Fuck that nigga Samuel\nDr. TC: Uhh, have you seen him?\nTyler: Nah, but if I seen that nigga I woulda killed him"}}, {"title": "Love In Da Mall", "album": null, "year": "2017-07-10", "lyrics": "Yeah\nTTDD y'all\nHot fire\n\nOoh woo woo woo woo woo wow wow\nOoh woo woo woo woo

a potato, give me my gun back\nBefore I blast bigger than pimples on Big Pun's back\nBlack fat bitches was washin' on my dishes\nAnd using my large stick on her lips like my cum's chapped\nI love Jews but I hate faggots\nAnd bitches who be nagging about me taking the trash out\nI got a fuckin' can of whoop ass, who wants to pack it\nGoing ape shit in the newest bape straight jacket\nWith six dicks of chap stick, sticking in my black lips\nSix sippie cups full of sick shit enhancements\nWolf Gang spit right\nAin't been this much fuckin' crack rock music since free way had flip side\nSo get low, lower than a ditch\nI'm with some retarded bitch, hoping she know how to kiss low\nThey know, I'm the clinic's aid and I'm sick\nSo they clap for me kinda like a herpe on the lip\nWith some tutor bitch, tryna tickle wetback hooter this\nBitch acting I still did not know with it\nUntil I put this cock on, the end of clitoris\nFucking this game I used this shit as spit as lubricant\nSo who you with? (Umm, fuck)\nI got this fuckin' gun, you better say yes you stupid bitch\nBefore you lose your wrist and rich make you do some dick\nI'm fucking crazy, well I guess I am if these shoes will fit\nFuck the Key club, they wanna ban 'em\nI got fucking fans from Compton to Montana\nTo Indiana, where deaf dwarfs still don't understand 'em\nBecause yelling at midgets is like me beefing with brandUn (Fuck him)\nStomp 'em out, with these crab ass Nikes\nMake it look like some slob, scribbled all on his white Tee\nInvite me, come on, you got a better chance to getting Shake\nMy dad and Earl's motherfuckin' momma to like me (Bitch)\nAnimals is farming you, patrick this is barnacles\nSaid he gave Ace a spongejob at the carnival\nAnd Spongebob got his head knocked from the piss that Ace got\nNigga's soft as baby cock and the cotton swab\n\nThis that fuck music, put your shit and fuck to it\nShouldn't give one when your bumping in the trunk to it\nGrab a couple gats, stuff 'em in your backpack and then take 'em to school\nFor show and tell day screamin' \"fuck students\"\nLocate the bitch that didn't wanna give you kiss\nThen get her tits, then use your fists to add a couple lumps to it\nShoot the faculty for taking hats, you stupid butts\nSkip the music teacher and the janitor you real cool with\nContinue this procedure until lunch is through with\nGo home out the back like a scared student\nKeep a low pro, until you on your block\nThen you just make it home in time for new news brief at 2ish\nStuck at all this bible study, shit is not fun\nMe and wolf gang go jump nuns for hot fun\nPlaying with the bell when shots heard, and cops come\nBut I'm still punchin' this bitch out, I'm not done\nSittin' in my room masturbating\nTruthful, these lyrics are relating like my dad did\nI make music for teenagers and bad ass kids\nBastard touched more boys than your local church did\nKilling these niggas off quick\nDon't believe me then watch me empty out a full clip\nTrigger being pulled, niggers in a ditch\nThat wasn't bullets, that was copies of Bastard you bitch", "image": "https://images.genius.com/8afb1ed248c3eb047a8fae95f5b024df.500x500x1.jpg",

shit\nThey say that I'm shock value\nHow about you hop off cock and turn volume down?\nI haven't got around to telling my mom shit (why?)\nCause I don't know how to...(whoa)\nAll I want is her support, but no, it's the fights at home\nWhen mommy cusses out cousin, some knifes get shown\nNow she's really fuckin' pissed, so the knives get thrown\nAnd hit her in her fucking neck, now her throat's all gone\nLooking like a fucking monster from the Twilight Zone\nThen they wonder why I stay at Travis' pad with a backpack\nFor the whole week, full of plastic-wrapped black tees\nAnd deodorant like his house is my home\nI could live with the same hat\nAnd the same flat-screen TV watching Flapjack\nAnd the same bacon and waffles on a nice Saturday\nWhere I skate with the same fucking friends that\nDidn't give a fuck about fame or a name, oh\n\"Message from The GZA, oh, another one from Plain Pat\"\nEmail full of emails, I never write back\nAin't kill myself yet, and I already want my life back\n\nI told her I'm her worst nightmare\nThis is hell, you don't ever gotta fight fair\nMy spirit floats around in the night air\nOr in your day dreams, that's how death seems\n\nOne shot, two shots, one gun, two cops\nI'm blowin' them flu shots, couldn't kill me with two top rockers\nYou're on the side of faggots and cock blockers\nI'm on the side of bad-ass kids and the top notches\nI'm Barney, dinosaur Harley of a human\nCause I'm shrooming with the bangers and the carneys\nYou niggas can't harm me cause y'all know that\nWe at the fuckin' Dirty like it's laundry (Tyler, calm down)\nNigga, get off me\n\n(Calm down, man)\nFuck off me man, fuck (what's gotten into you?)\nI don't know, it's like I'm a different person at times\nSometimes I'm fucking mad, sometimes I'm not (yeah, you...)\nIt's like I got a fucking voice in my head\nTelling me to do all this fucked up shit, man (yeah, what's this?)\nI don't fucking know, man (what's this person named

showing no religion respect\nBrain damage, therapy's the only thing I regret\nTalking to me is like a fucking body missing a neck\nBut, I'm surprised I ain't pop off my top off\nLife is a bitch and my cock's soft, the Glock's cocked\nMy hands tremble, my finger slipped, the wall's red\nHer life is fucked, she's sad now, her son is dead\n\nI told her I'm her worst nightmare\nThis is hell, you don't ever gotta fight fair\nMy spirit floats around in the night air\nOr in your day dreams, that's how death seems\nI told her I'm her worst nightmare\nThis is hell, you don't ever gotta fight fair\nMy spirit floats around in the night air\nOr in your daydreams, that's how death seems\n\nWhen I was younger, I would smile a lot\nI'm getting older, getting bolder, but a wiser top\nNow I'm drunk driving, lap's full of Budweiser tops\nLife is a movie and you're just a prop\nThey begged me to stop, but I listen like deaf drums\nLove? I don't get none, that's why I'm so hostile to the kids that get some\nMy father called me to tell me he loved me\u2014\nI'd have a better chance of getting Taylor Swift to fuck me\nAnnoying and I'm ugly, most niggas wanna punch me\nI'm surprised the fucking doctor even touched me\nFeel like Humpty, you hoping that I'll fall? Fuck y'all\nI'm Ace, I'm parentless, odd, kinda arrogant\nIgnorant as fuck, offend people for the hell of it\nBecause I am the devil, fucker, get on my level\nDoughnuts and keys and kick-flips, Supremes and markers\nMy life is Ms. Mon-unique Parker, but a little darker\nI'll see you in a couple, OF\n\nI told her I'm her worst nightmare\nThis is hell, you don't ever gotta fight fair\nMy spirit floats around in the night air\nOr in your day dreams, that's how death seems\nI told her I'm her worst nightmare\nThis is hell, you don't ever gotta fight fair\nMy spirit floats around in the night air\nOr in your daydreams, that's how death seems\n\n\"Tyler, here's some water, man\nYou seem a little tense... how's Thebe?\"\n\nAll because a nigga just don't give a fuck\nParents wanna blame me all because their kid is fucking up\nBut fuck that, you're a shitty parent, face it, suck it up\nThat's what you should've did before that nigga bust, huh\nFeel like I missed my little brother growing up\nFeel like my little brother missed his brother growing up\nBut this is Golf Wang, like he missed his family growing up\nI got a little taller since the last time you seen me, bruh\nNow I'm emo, so fuck it, I'm pouring up\nBut I never had a drink\u2014 (Sydney, Tyler's throwing up!)\nMy nigga Jasper said if I drink and get drunk enough\nI won't feel the feelings I be feeling when I'm sobered up\nBut that's a fucking lie, why would he say that? I'm\nAs emotionally straight as Travis when he--(Tyler, calm down)\nDon't look at me, I'm 6'5\", about to fucking cry\nAbout another guy, but this is Golf Wang, do or die\nI finally had a family\nDomo's in another state, and where the fuck is Riley?\nNow you niggas wanna be nice because the labels wanna sign me\nBut before the co-signing and you fuckers couldn't find me?\nFuck that! I hope you die in a fiery death\nOne ear I got kids screaming, \"O.F. is the best\"\nThe other ear I got Tron Cat, asking where the bullets and the bombs at\nSo I can kill these levels of stress, shit\nThey say that I'm shock value\nHow about you hop off cock and turn volume down?\nI haven't got around to telling my mom shit (why?)\nCause I don't know how to...(whoa)\nAll I want is her support, but no, it's the fights at home\nWhen mommy cusses out cousin, some knifes get shown\nNow she's really fuckin' pissed, so the knives get thrown\nAnd hit her in her fucking neck, now her throat's all gone\nLooking like a fucking monster from the Twilight Zone\nThen they wonder why I stay at Travis' pad with a backpack\nFor the whole week, full of plastic-wrapped black tees\nAnd deodorant like his house is my home\nI could live with the same hat\nAnd the same flat-screen TV watching Flapjack\nAnd the same bacon and waffles on a nice Saturday\nWhere I skate with the same fucking friends that\nDidn't give a fuck about fame or a name, oh\n\"Message from The GZA, oh, another one from Plain Pat\"\nEmail full of emails, I never write back\nAin't kill myself yet, and I already want my life back\n\nI told her I'm her worst nightmare\nThis is hell, you don't ever gotta fight fair\nMy spirit floats around in the night air\nOr in your day dreams, that's how death seems\n\nOne shot, two shots, one gun, two cops\nI'm blowin' them flu shots, couldn't kill me with two top rockers\nYou're on the side of faggots and cock blockers\nI'm on the side of bad-ass kids and the top notches\nI'm Barney, dinosaur Harley of a human\nCause I'm shrooming with the bangers and the carneys\nYou niggas can't harm me cause y'all know that\nWe at the fuckin' Dirty like it's laundry (Tyler, calm down)\nNigga, get off me\n\n(Calm down, man)\nFuck off me man, fuck (what's gotten into you?)\nI don't know, it's like I'm a different person at times\nSometimes I'm fucking mad, sometimes I'm not (yeah, you...)\nIt's like I got a fucking voice in my head\nTelling me to do all this fucked up shit, man (yeah, what's this?)\nI don't fucking know, man (what's this person named then, Tyler, huh?)\nHe tells me to do this shit, that I don't wanna fucking do (what's his name?)\nTron Cat"}}, {"title": "November", "album": "Flower Boy", "year": "2017-07-21", "lyrics": "Say some more, never want to talk about it\nFeel a way, woah\nFeel a way, woah\nFeel a way, woah\n\nTake me back to November\nTake me back to November\nHawaiian shirts in the winter, cold water, cold water\nYeah, take me back to November, wassup\nCan we go back to November?\nTake me back to November\nHawaiian shirts in the winter, deep thoughts, deep thoughts\nNaw, take me back to November, wassup\n\nWhat if Clancy fuckin' me over?\nWhat if 'Who Dat Boy' is rhetorical and this shit is over?\nWhat if I'm hustling backwards?\nWhat if my accountant ain't payin' my taxes?\nFillin' his pockets and IRS show up asking me questions\nI couldn't answer 'cause I was too busy tryna make classics\nBoy ain't got no motherfucking classics\nWhat if my music too weird for the masses?\nAnd I'm only known for tweets more than beats or\nAll my day ones turn to three, fours 'cause of track seven\nFuck, what if I get stuck?\nWhat if I got comfortable?

Creator, man, look\nCasey Veggies, uh-huh, Odd Future, look\n\nHello, the hype is so mellow\nBitch I'm dope but my pipe is so yellow\nThe blue polka dots, pink stripes and it's pink on the title\nNigga, fuck your role model, bitch, I'm my own idol and\nIf you can't face it, my nigga, you can ass it\nMy accessorized accessories bring out my assets\nNigga they sound on acid, tablets\nStussy\u2019s G-Shock with my custom pair of 3D glasses\nI suffer from ADHD\nI should win a fucking award for being me\nBeat banging the tom-toms\nMy producer selection is fresh nigga, fuck Vons\nAce the underdog, thrown them on the back bender\nCause I change my outfit more than transsexuals change gender\nEating Belgian waffles with Italian biscotts\nI sold my soul to the devil for thirty percent off\nAnd to you emo kids who walk around pissed off\nStep one: pull your panties down and start to piss off\nStep two: run to your radio, turn this shit off\nNigga didn't bother, so my father didn't help\nSo when my mom would beat my ass, she would always hit me\nWith Gucci belts, Gucci imprint from leather welts\n\nI'm so dapper man, funky fresh Dapper Dan\nI'm your favorite

really want girl (ooh)\nMy heart stops pumping blood, when I see you (I see you, when I see you)\nBut try to play it cool because (I like you, I really like you)\n\nGirl, you're so special\nTo me, to me\nTo me, to me\nTo me, to me\nTo me, to me\nTo me, to me\nTo me, to me\nTo me...\n\nLet's move to California\nRight now (pack your bags, go pack your bags)\nI have wings on my back, so we don't (take the plane, have to take the plane)\nGirl, I know you ready, I can see it in your eyes\n(Boy, I know you're not, I can tell you're terrified)\nOh, nobody has to know and if they did, they wouldn't care\n(When you rub my hands switching fifth gear)\nForget about it baby, let's not waste our afternoon (forget about it baby)\nCause we're gonna go fly to the moon (we're gonna go flyin' to the moon)\nYeah, but anyway (Pack your bags, did you pack your bags)\nLeave your crew, bring your coat, cause it\u2019s cold (leave your crew, bring your coat)\n\nGirl, you're so special\nTo me, to me\nTo me, to me\nTo me, to me\nTo me, to me\nTo me, to me (ohh)\n\n(Don't you wanna go back)\n(Let's go, let's go)\n(Right now)\nI think I believe you (Let me show you how girl)\nIt's nice that I need to\nThe earth is so rough I'm not calling your bluff\nWhat, what, what (She would love that)\nI think I believe you\nTake me higher\nLet's make our way over\nTo the Okaga cave\nToday (today)\nThere we will stay,  play it cool now\nX-Y-Z how?\nWelcome me in\nThen we'll begin\n\nSuckin' on my ears,fingers rubbing through your hair\nFastwind, slowwind, fuck yeah, we behaving bad, uh\nProbably couldn't tell but I be blushing when you with me\nWhen you kiss me, swear to God, blood was rushing to my Jimmy, oh\nLaying on my trampoline, looking at the stars\nFrom my fake space fog machine\nLaying on my arm, it's dead\nFrom the pressure of your head\nI said I loved you, said it back\nLike it was scripted, but you meant it\nLike the flavor of that lemonade\nThat we was sippin on our sushi-ridden dinner date\nOh, you think you special now?\nOther bitches trippin' now\nCause we're fleeing to the moon\nFuck Earth, man we sick of y'all\nWings on my backs and we ain't gotta cop a ticket, nah, nah, nah\n\nOh yeah\nOh yeah, let's go to the moon!\nOh yeah, let's go to the moon!\nOh yeah (Let's go!)\nOh yeah, let's go to the moon!\nOh yeah, let's go to the moon!\n(Watch this) Let's go to the moon!\nOh yeah\n(Favorite director)\n(Gonna be good)\nCome on, baby\nWhat you wanna do?\n(I\u2019ll be okay)\n(I really like you)\n\nTake me away\nFuck what they say\nTo another place\nAnother day\nWe in outer space\nWe'll waste our days\nSade, Sade, Sade (sade)\nOh, right now ()\nYes!\nLet's go to the moon (Yes!)\n(It's about to start)"}}, {"title": "OKRA", "album": null,

dark in parks\nHit that corner, then they're gone\nThey can't call for help because I took their phone\nUsing up minutes, use them to call my homies just to tell them that I'm in it\nBitch I dare you to scream\nHaven't you heard of Sarah? That's me\nI made that bitch my milk tits\nI was dressed up like Lisa Simpson\nPut her to sleep, quick in my hilton\nNow I'm bout to change your name to Ruth Wilson\nVoices in my head like kill them\nAmityville insanity pill\nI can't swallow my cavities\nThey're strictly from these casualties, that's really good with ham and cheese\nLoad them up on Craigslist\nMy email address is:\nHow-you-doing-my-name-is-Tyler, and you're a dead bitch\n(First)\n\n(Aye, Aye, Aye,Aye)\nRun bitch, run!\n(Howl)\n(I'm a motherfuckin' wolf)\n\nYou better run, bitch"}}, {"title": "P", "album": "The OF Tape Vol. 2", "year": "2012-03-20", "lyrics": "Broke dick, I'm looking for a drug lord\n\nOkay, welcome to my 12 bar (One, um..)\nThe beat, wears it like a kevlar\nAs I smoke my tree, medlar, South African\nCoughing 'til there's pains in my fucking abdomen\nI spit negative just like a halogen\nMy breeze more of a fucking masculine\nThe rascals win, killing 'em off with a javelin\nSnakes, I'm just rattling, suit tailor never tattling\nYou niggas a bunch of squares, Madison\nAs far as real niggas, bitch nigga my battle's sick\nOn top of being talented, bitch I'm fucking passionate\nI'm a golden curse, call me treacherous, treasure chest\nBetter yet, I'll build on to the beat like tetris\nRemember me forgetfulness?

I am your correctionist\nI stitched Odd and Future together like a leather vest\nYou fucking sweater neck, feather peck, Rosetta checks\nI put together decks and push for beef, if hefferless\nI'm headed out to Sydney Australia with Tim Donnelly\nHe gets caught up at security, the TSA don't follow me\nTea parties are the shit, forty mags by the scones\nI'm fighting for gun rights to shoot a nigga in his dome\nClick your fucking heels, there's no place like home\nCock back and blast off written on the tombstone, ain't that a bitch\n\nThat wasn't a 12 bar (Tyler, what's up, nigga?)\nI can't count (What's wrong?)\n(Tyler what's wrong man?)\n\nLet's see, what's wrong with me?\nMight be my fucking Tourette's, see?\nI need a vacation cause all this shit got me stressing\nSo after the showers with Sandusky\nMe and Sean Kingston went and rented a couple jet skis\nLionel rolled the blunts up, so meanwhile\nMe and Lucas getting fucked up\nYou can smell us coming like a faggot when he hicks up\nListening to Common's last album to get pumped up\nTo finally ask *censored* when I can get my dick sucked\nYou know Casey Anthony, was handling\nDropping her kids off so she could come out and dance with me\nWine in the pantry, wrestling on my trampoline\nLearned some new chords while you uncreatives were sampling\nI'm Wolf, I spit flow retardedly\nAs retarded as the sound of deaf people arguing\nYou hold the future of the kid you daughter's gargling\nMe, I have the Odd Future mothafuckin' sergeanting\n(Tyler, calm the fuck down) No, I'm the fuck now\nMy poppa didn't give one, that's why I'm like this now\nI'm still down to cut throat and if another fan asks\nFor a fucking photo while I'm snacking on my pizza lunchable\nI'm 'a fucking snap like Berman when he acts right\nThen have a mental breakdown and proceed to use a crack pipe (don't do that!)\nOF will be done for, niggas will be dumb poor\nDon't believe me, ok be right back, I'm headed to the gun store\nM-16's and them 6 teens came out of nowhere\nLike your kid's wet dream, what you mean old news\nOh you really need us to fucking show you\nThat we're harder than findin a fuckin Snicker bar in Whole Foods\nIn a black hoodie, nose bruised and a gold tooth\nHoping the fuckin' security guard doesn't hold you in custody\nBut luckily had a couple of guns with me\nLike gay step mom, none of you mothafuckas can fuck with me\n\nVete a la casa de tu mama\nNo mas andan aqui con sus babosadas\nQue Odd Future ni que Odd Future\nYo no se que es eso, idiotas\nQue chingados es Odd Future\nGolf Wang, Golf Tyler?

but I don't have no rhythm\nSo fuck it, take a chance with me\nThe party isn't over, we could still dance girl\nBut I don't have no rhythm\nSo fuck it, take a chance with a nigga\nLike me, like me\nPart 2 - Campfire\n\nYeah, uhm\nAll I needed was a stick, grab the marshmallows\nMotherfuckers getting lynched and burned\nI earned it, my Flog Gnaw badge is looking good\nOn this brand new jacket\nThe donuts on the flag waving over the cabin\nNow grab them graham crackers and pass them over here\nHurry, quickly I need a piece of Hersheys\nDarker than the corners of the bushes we be lurking\nI centered the mellow over the graham\nHeated it too long now, it's melting over my hand\nFuck it, I'll bite it, I burnt it, but I liked it\nCamping with my niggas, its so fucking exciting\n\nWe're making smores by the campfire\nCamp flog gnaw, golf wang summer\n\nSat by the fire\nTo witness gentle, but radical\nTransformation ceased to be mindless\nCreate our own sweetness\nAt last growing the heart\n\nYo bring the bass back in\nYeah, hehe\nWho ate all the fuckin chocolate?\nOh that's Domo fat ass, haha\nYeah\nI ain't trying to go home, really\nPart 3 - Bimmer\n\nYou remind me of my bimmer\nA lot of trunk space, the perfect two seater\nAnd you got a lot of drive, I\u2019m trying to keep up\nBut it's not a lot of miles on ya meter\nYou remind me of my bimmer\nSee your ignition, baby girl I'm trying to key up\nAnd your head lights are off, I'm trying to see 'em\nBut it's not a lot of miles on ya meter\nSo let me start it up and smash\n\nPop some Tame Impala, your man got a lame Impala\n(It'll get dark outside soon)\nAnd I'm sharing Slurpees and you ain't even begin to swallow\nYou\u2019re fucking nuts, green top we coupled up\nRun my fingers through em as you wax and buff my muffler\nCause I fingered you, you think the fucking ring is coming up?\n(Where the street lights trail, Oooooooo)\nMaybe, I don\u2019t know, I think you\u2019re chill\n(Ride for)\nRiding on my pegs, and my back against your legs\nAnd a seatbelt is needed if I get between 'em, yeah\n\nYou remind me of my bimmer\nA lot of trunk space, the perfect two seater\nAnd you got a

trying to see 'em\nBut it's not a lot of miles on ya meter\nSo let me start it up and smash\n\nMmmm it\u2019ll get dark outside, soon (My baby, ride for me)\nWhere the street lights trail (My baby,

Hey, have you seen Salem?\nOh she with that new dude, Wolf, or, Darnell, whatever his name is\nFuck that nigga, man.

answers are all there\n(But I'm just too blind to see)\nYou and I are cut from different fabric\n(I wonder why, I wonder why with you, girl)\nDon't be too material to see\n(But I'm just too blind to

not bipolar, see I'm just known by those couple names\nI wanna tell my pops but shit, he'll probably say the same\nFuck...\nHated by everyone, that's the way it seems\nI don't know what's shorter, his damn temper or my self esteem\nI sit in my room and I listen to tunes, I'm amused alone\nCause none of the cool kids would let me join a team\nDepression's on the stalk again\nMy best friend's an inhaler because it will not let me cough\nWhenever I am losing oxygen, bully hand around my neck\nCause he felt disrespected when I decided to talk again\nI brought that on myself, see I should know my place\nBut not at lunchtime, see I know better then to show my face\nAround them, but the day I do it'll be everywhere\nWhen I share these feelings finally they gon' fucking care\n\nGrab a couple friends, start a couple riots\nCrash a couple-\nGather all the bullies, crush them motherfuckers\nOdd Future hooligans causing up a ruckus\nIt's us, nigga\nI said it's us, nigga\n\nMurder, murder, m-murder the last they heard of you\nWas when I... \"uh\" with all them burners, you\nThink that I'm some punk bully bitch who ain't gon' trouble you\nWell, I'm gonna burst your bubble two times if you dont mind\nUmm \"Who are you again?\" I'm Samuel and that's Tyler\nWe came to get wild and style in these trench coats!\nDon't start asking what's packing in these trench coats!\nJust know if you start acting, I'm grabbing for these trench coats!\nMy step-father called me a fag\nI'll show him a fag, I'll light a fire up in his ass\nAnd recently them assholes been fucking with me in class\nSo I'ma keep them muhfuckers there and make sure they pass huh\nMy prom date, she dismissed my offer\nSo I'mma  her and toss her in the principal's office\n(Tyler, I'll go with you)\nOh, now you wanna conversate with me try to be my friend? (Where are my parents at?-) Don't worry, you'll probably never see them again\n\nGrab a couple friends, start a couple riots\nCrash a couple-\nGather all the bullies, crush them motherfuckers\nOdd Future hooligans causing up a ruckus\nIt's us, nigga\nI said it's us, nigga\n\nBum bum bum bum bum\nBum bum bum bum bum\nBum. bum. bum. burumrumrumrum bum bum bum\nBum bum bumbumbumbum, hehe\nWe are the Sams, and we're dead -- it's just four of us\nWe come in peace, we mean no harm, and we're inglorious\nWe took their heads but we just took back what they took from us\nI guess we lost ours\n\nMusic had nothing to do with my final decision\nI just really wanted somebody to come pay me attention\nBut nobody would listen, but stuffed animals that I had\nSince I was a kid but I'm growing up so they're missing\nI didn't mean to hurt anybody, I'm sorry\nI wouldn't hurt a fly or consider joining the Army\nI'm hardly ever angry, Roger Rabbit framed me\nMomma I'm the same fucking kid that you made, see?\nI don't wanna go to jail, I just wanna go home\nAnd I want them fucking kids at school to just leave me alone\nAnd I... I hear helicopters make a dip\nI'm fucking reloaded -- I told you all that I ain't taking shit\nYou better back up before this Mac start to lift up\nI'll pump it like my inhaler when asthma begin to act up\nThe difference between us and our class is tan khakis\nI got 99 problems and all of them's being happy", "image": "https://images.genius.com/dde81a162bfe7b81092c8630cdf16d70.1000x1000x1.jpg", "artist": "Tyler, The Creator", "raw": {"annotation_count": 46, "api_path": "/songs/133411", "description": {"dom": {"tag": "root", "children": [{"tag": "p", "children": ["The song talks about why Sam (a character in the album) is so fucked up.

just known by those couple names\nI wanna tell my pops but shit, he'll probably say the same\nFuck...\nHated by everyone, that's the way it seems\nI don't know what's shorter, his damn temper or my self esteem\nI sit in my room and I listen to tunes, I'm amused alone\nCause none of the cool kids would let me join a team\nDepression's on the stalk again\nMy best friend's an inhaler because it will not let me cough\nWhenever I am losing oxygen, bully hand around my neck\nCause he felt disrespected when I decided to talk again\nI brought that on myself, see I should know my place\nBut not at lunchtime, see I know better then to show my face\nAround them, but the day I do it'll be everywhere\nWhen I share these feelings finally they gon' fucking care\n\nGrab a couple friends, start a couple riots\nCrash a couple-\nGather all the bullies, crush them motherfuckers\nOdd Future hooligans causing up a ruckus\nIt's us, nigga\nI said it's us, nigga\n\nMurder, murder, m-murder the last they heard of you\nWas when I... \"uh\" with all them burners, you\nThink that I'm some punk bully bitch who ain't gon' trouble you\nWell, I'm gonna burst your bubble two times if you dont mind\nUmm \"Who are you again?\" I'm Samuel and that's Tyler\nWe came to get wild and style in these trench coats!\nDon't start asking what's packing in these trench coats!\nJust know if you start acting, I'm grabbing for these trench coats!\nMy step-father called me a fag\nI'll show him a fag, I'll light a fire up in his ass\nAnd recently them assholes been fucking with me in class\nSo I'ma keep them muhfuckers there and make sure they pass huh\nMy prom date, she dismissed my offer\nSo I'mma  her and toss her in the principal's office\n(Tyler, I'll go with you)\nOh, now you wanna conversate with me try to be my friend?

He is going to live life to the fullest capacity of goodness, happiness and fun.

for this trip\nBut I do bring a terror like I hate America\nA brand new camera and a parachute\nNigga you and I are not the same, we not parallel\nDon't talk to me 'fore I fuckin' embarrass you\nNow sit your ass down you doin' three much\nI'm the captain on this bitch, don't get it fucked up\nOr you'll get fucked up\n\n\nI'm so far ahead you niggas I'm in the future\nY'all don't even know about my existence, it's like I'm dead to you\nYou niggas, I'm sayin',look, y'all be on the stupid shit\nI'm the fuckin' pilot, your role is to be the stewardess\nI'm the fuckin' bomb like I was stuffing my shoe with it\nThe boy's a fucking problem like turbulence boy, get used to it\nIf anything happens its one door\nIf I see a building, motherfucker we're done for\nI'mma hit a couple of 'em up this is Parkour\nBetter call your family and give 'em your last wishes, nigga\nAnd every line dirty, you thought that I dug ditches\nBut I never give a fuck, it's like I was born dickless\nI don't wanna crash anymore, I don't wanna crash anymore\nI just wanna soar through the space, let the wind hit my face\nTill there's nothing left in the gas tank\nI don't wanna crash, I don't wanna crash anymore\nI don't wanna crash anymore\nI just wanna soar through the space, let the wind hit my face\nTill there's nothing left in the gas tank, I don't wanna crash\n\nI'm in first class but I feel like coach, yeah\nUh, cause I'm in first class but I feel like coach, yeah\nUh, cause I'm in first class but I feel like coach, yeah\nIt's kinda weird\nCause I'm in first class but I feel like coach\n\nI'm tryna find a place, a place where I can land at\nA place where I can be\nWith no alphabet dictatin' where to stand at\nYou can buy a car, you can buy many things\nYou can buy happiness but you can't buy wings\nYou can buy a parachute, you can buy a parrot\nBut you can't buy a pair of wings, aerodynamic\nTo stay cloud level\nThat's why I'm in first class but I feel like coach\nCause I'm in first class but I feel like coach\nIt's just crazy how you can have everything in the world but\nYou in first class but you feel like coach, damn\nThat's why I'm in first class but I feel like coach\n\nI don't

dealerships even let me cop\nSo now I'm speedin' and tryna drive away from the fact\nThat she was right, so I triple left, tryna double back\nThe streets are filled with some clues\nLike how I ain't notice that?

All I ever told you to do was grow up, don't grow down. You know, like, you know, grow up. Don't grow down, grow out. You go from being a kid, just doing your thing, hanging out with your friends. Months later you're world famous. You're a gay rights activist, and you don't even know it. You know what, I don't wanna say it to you no more, Tyler. Fuck you, Tyler!\"\n\nWatch me get this money, nigga; tired of being hungry, nigga\nNothing funny, sass me while I'm thrashing, I'mma punch you, nigga\nNever made of plastic, I'm a savage -- you look lunch, my nigga\nPassing all you hating fucking fags we don't discuss, my nigga\nWe ain't on no jolly shit and we don't pop no Mollies, bitch\nI'm hocking, spitting got some niggas out here popping Ollie switch\nBuncha novices, Odd Future the squad is thick\nThem young niggas is back and brash, attacking with no common sense\nWe the last of a dying breed\nAnd we don't give a fuck, so we cannot supply your needs\nYou stupid niggas who had said our hype is dying, please\nMy pockets solid, making profit off the highest tees\nBitch, merch twerk as I get on the verse, cursing\nNigga Dom so cool, I refer him in third person\nWatch me get this money, I'm up when the birds chirping\nMake actions, fuck rehearsing\n\nNigga, summer, fall, wintertime, twenty-four, three-sixty-five\nYou niggas gon' give me mine, I don't have plenty time\nFlying out at any time, getting money, any grind\nYou niggas gon' give me mine, you niggas gon' give me mine\n\nIn a world where kids my age are popping Mollies with leather\nSitting on Tumblr, never outside or enjoying the weather\nCan name a sweater, but not a talent or don't know if whether\nOr not they got one, tried to change their life for the better\nI was the drama club kid, I run where the fun did, my nuts itched\nI was defiant, always said, \"Fuck shit\"\nHated the popular ones, now I'm the popular one\nAlso hated homes too, til I start coppin' me some\nSee I don't beez in the trap, nigga, I beez in the b's\nAnd I be gassing up my buzz like some bees at a Shell\nFucking sick and getting bigger like I sneezed on Adele\nAnd bitches getting touchy-feely like they reading some Braille\nI bust quick like gun-holders with short tempers, and well\nI tried to tell the kids, like fuck it, start being yourself\nThese fucking rappers got stylists cause they can't think for themselves\nSee, they don't have an identity, so they needed some help, but\nReally, boy? Poseurs looking silly, boy\nI'm in that past season 'Preme shit, older than Tity Boi\nNot a diss, but same with ice cream, my shit is Diddy Riese\nNa'kel Smith, Transworld page 64\nPoppin' like oil ollie in fire flames\nI'm harder than DJ Khaled playing the fucking quiet game\nThe fuck am I saying? Tyler's not even a violent name\nAbout as threatening as stained windbreakers in hurricanes\nBut he rapes women, and spit wrong, like he hates dentists\nGod damn menace, 666 and he's not finished\nAnd my shit's missing, he hates women, but love kittens?\nSee y'all niggas tripping, man\nLook at that article that says my subject matter is wrong\nSaying I hate gays even though Frank is on 10 of my songs\nLook at that Mom who thinks I'm evil, hold that grudge against me\nThough I'm the reason that her motherfucking son got to eat\nLook at the kid who had the 9 and tried to blow out his mind\nBut talk is money, I said, \"Hi,\" I guess I bought him some time\nLook at the ones in the crowd -- that shit is barnacles, huh?\nThey thought I wasn't fair until I threw a carnival, huh?\nBut then again, I'm an atheist that just worships Satan\nAnd it's probably why I'm not getting no fucking album placements\nAnd MTV could suck my dick, and I ain't fuckin' playing\nBruh, they never played it, I just won shit for they fucking ratings\n\"Analog\" fans are getting sick of the rape\nAll the \"Tron Cat\" fans are getting sick of the lakes\nBut what about me, bitch? I'm getting sick of complaints\nBut I don't hate it when I'm taking daily trips to the bank\nOh but no but, shit, who really gives a fuck what I think?\nMy fans don't, they turning on me, shit, they're almost extinct\nFuck buying studio time, I'mma go purchase a shrink\nRecord the session and send all you motherfuckers a link, bitch\n\nNigga, summer, fall, wintertime, twenty-four, three-sixty-five\nYou niggas gon' give me mine, I don't have plenty time\nFlying out at any time, getting money, any grind\nYou niggas gon' give me mine, you niggas gon' give me mine\n\nThis shit just like the nights I look forward to not remembering\nSo much for being sober, I hope that you can forgive me\nBut Momma, I'm close to the edge as possible (Why don't you jump, you fucking pussy?)\nAll I\u2019m seeing is the drop in my ocular, jumping like they told me\nThat the 40's half off, like you know that cliff\nDon't need a therapist to tell him he could float that shit (Fucking faggot)\nOr get compared to fucking pair with all the program kids\nSo maybe a pair of pale bitches for the gonads lick (I'll show you)\nMalt liquor filling me up, and all us not giving no fucks and\nAll of them sensitive chumps in awe when that pistol erupts (Pistol, I got one!)\nDirty one spitting that sumpy raw till his wrists in the cuffs\nBrother the Pigeons is us\nBid you goodnight and good luck\n(Oh, shut the fuck up!)\n(Gunshot)\n\nSamuel's here! Where's Wolf? Fucking faggot. Salem was mine, bitch!

I'm getting sick of complaints\nBut I don't hate it when I'm taking daily trips to the bank\nOh but no but, shit, who really gives a fuck what I think?\nMy fans don't, they turning on me, shit, they're almost extinct\nFuck buying studio time, I'mma go purchase a shrink\nRecord the session and send all you motherfuckers a link, bitch\n\nNigga, summer, fall, wintertime, twenty-four, three-sixty-five\nYou niggas gon' give me mine, I don't have plenty time\nFlying out at any time, getting money, any grind\nYou niggas gon' give me mine, you niggas gon' give me mine\n\nThis shit just like the nights I look forward to not remembering\nSo much for being sober, I hope that you can forgive me\nBut Momma, I'm close to the edge as possible (Why don't you jump, you fucking pussy?)\nAll I\u2019m seeing is the drop in my ocular, jumping like they told me\nThat the 40's half off, like you know that cliff\nDon't need a therapist to tell him he could float that shit (Fucking faggot)\nOr get compared to fucking pair with all the program kids\nSo maybe a pair of pale bitches for the gonads lick (I'll show you)\nMalt liquor filling me up, and all us not giving no fucks and\nAll of them sensitive chumps in awe when that pistol erupts (Pistol, I got one!)\nDirty one spitting that sumpy raw till his wrists in the cuffs\nBrother the Pigeons is us\nBid you goodnight and good luck\n(Oh, shut the fuck up!)\n(Gunshot)\n\nSamuel's here!

fuck of it, no fame\nAim, shoot, the gun of love, round\nTried to find ammo but it's none around town\nSo I went Down South but I ended up North\nUptown sitting on Cloud 9's white porch\nAnd of course, my car's off course\nYou're so white, my blinkers don't work\nI'm trying to let the force be with you, I get you\nMusic is my first, but I contemplate divorce\nYou make a nigga sing songs nice\nYou make a nigga's night turn day\nAnd you make the flowers sing say turn green yellow\nIt sucks that I didn't get the chance to say hello\nI want to eat you out like jello\nAnd mess with your body like the bass and the cello\nAnd tell your mom I said hello, you want to go to prom? (Nigga hell no)\nFuck (Shit) and another one, there goes another one\n\nAnother love song about shit\nAnd I'll be rich if I get another diss\nAnd maybe Cupid won't miss\n\nMaybe? (No)\nMaybe? (I'm sorry)\nMaybe? (I got a date)\nMaybe? (Where's your dad?)\n\nI like her L-I-K-E, the only difference is she won't fuck with me\nBut she will fuck with that vegetable with the hairs full of X's and O's\nI want to tie her body up and throw her in my basement\nKeep her there, so nobody can wonder where her face went\n- Tyler, what you doing?\n- Shut the fuck up!\n- Uh-umm..\n- You gon' fuckin' love me bitch\n- Uhh..\n- Or I'mma fuckin' put this gun in your fuckin' head\nBut all I really want is a kiss on the cheek\nIn private, not public in the streets\nAnd your cupcake how we eat and your toes\nCause I got a big fetish with the feet\nI just want somebody I can see\nYou can be a gold digger, you ain't got to love me\nI'm serious (I love you) I don't ask for much\nYour heart literally is what I do want for lunch\nNow this shit is turning to a habit\nI'm the burger king, I gotta have it my way\nAnd truthfully girl you really make my day\nI would probably kill myself if you told me you was gay\nAnd I can't even look the other way\nYour aura is a magnet, my eyes a metal bag, it's attractive\nL-O-L laughing, you're a gold Oscar and I'm just actin'\nAnd I want your cinema hole, and have our kids play supporting role\nClimbing up the pole, Jack and the Beanstalk, bitch it's gold\nAnd I was in loath, I would never get over you, ever, Sarah\n\n\nHalf your body laying on my chest\nThe rest is in my stomach, that's including your breast\nAnd I'ma just take another guess\nNow you probably wishing that you would have said yes\nAm I crazy? Maybe, but fucked up is how I been lately\nShit, I don't give a fuck, your family looking for you, wish 'em good luck\nBitch, you tried to play me like a dummy\nNow you stuck up in my mothafuckin' basement all bloody\nAnd I'm fucking your dead body, your coochie all cummy\nLooking in your dead eyes, what the fuck you want from me?\nWhat did you want from me?

that, in the lost and found\nWhere the black girls get their weaves back\nAwesome I achieve that mini, blasting \"You're a jerk\"\nIn some fucking yellow skinnies looking like a fucking faggot\nBouncing 'round the house trying to find an easy way to rape Minnie\nBet you thirty dollars you find her like Cartman found Kenny, dead\nI like my girls smart, skinny\nKinda pop tart, when I bite into them red\nI'm a self-racist, you should tape this, ask Sarah, I'm the rapist\nI'm a fascist, fuck fashion, Gucci belts is for them faggots\nMy hat is by Jabbia, and if you got a fucking problem\nWith the future, you can get a death wish just like Atiba\nFuck the biz apparent, Odd Future errant\nI'm watching the Berrics getting head from someone's parent\nA lot of fucking hate inside my heart, guaranteed\nThat I'm sharing in the force with the cyclops staring\nI'm flying on a beaver, you're a disbeliever\nSo don't ask for no mothafuckin' ride when you see us\nSwim right past you, the shit-list said that I'm nutty such a cashew\nCause I jack off with dish soap and smell gas fumes\nPermanent brain damage similar to tattoos\nThe shit, you can mention me if anybody ask you\nKill the jungle let the cats loose\nYou didn't see me here if someone ask you\n\nI want to feel her in every way\nMary Jane keeps me high like every day\nBong, vaporizer, in the sack now\nStuck in my high, afraid of heights, I'm trapped\nBuy a swisher for a dollar or two blunt wraps\nRoll it up and ensure that everything's fat\nShe ain't got time to try and relieve ya\nBut she'll get all in your head, Sativa\n\nI'm good but y'all don't want me like vegetables\nI'm all in front of you zeroes like decimals\nLet's take them high like the decibels\nSo we get them high, get them high like cholesterol\nIn a overweight mother-lover, my tracks is filled with blubber\nThat's fat, who needs another producer?\nChica-Go-Getter from Odd Future, used to ride solo\nCause I ain't really care what the rest say\nType of nigga to jerk off to his own sex tape\nBest stay away when the door closed, I show up with four hoes\nBest believe I'm leaving with more of those\nAnd I got a girlfriend so I'm a keep lying until the verse end, FIN\nBrandun Deshay, Hodgy Beats, Ace the Creator\nOdd Future, O.F. until, until from now until forever\n\nWe grind, these niggas asking for some promo\nWe sit back, observe, stacking hella box logos\nSquare circle jerks starting O.F. moshpit\nPreaching to the poets, I'm an O.F. prophet\nNo less profit, fiened when we drop shit\nConvertible coupe, bitches scream when they tops split\nIt's that crack, give you something to sell\nPut these bitches on lock down, something like jail\nThought she hot I swear, probably rougher than hell\nAnd she ain't gay, but the only thing she like is fucking Chanel\nLight skinned women, all sex everything\nThink we can fit ten in, bowls packed with everything\nEverything that we call flight, living life\nThis is everything that we call hype\nI'm everything that they call nice\nShe in colors and shit, she off that northern lights, right\nIntimidated by niggas you can't be\nI'm a G, and this is something you can't see\nTop ranked, number one my son\nAnd she looking for them trees, baby we got some\nAnd stay focused on the women and you get less done\nIt's ironic cause I always hear you talking about one\nThem other niggas smoke, they ain't this high\nHow high? Nigga, higher than the kites they fly", "image": "https://images.genius.com/4c2b63a8598d42edb317eaf311d36882.1000x1000x1.jpg", "artist": "Tyler, The Creator", "raw": {"annotation_count": 52, "api_path": "/songs/3232", "description": {"dom": {"tag": "root", "children": [{"tag": "p", "children": ["Tyler starts a rap session while his friends spark up a weed session.

feedback\nMy self-respect I leave that, in the lost and found\nWhere the black girls get their weaves back\nAwesome I achieve that mini, blasting \"You're a jerk\"\nIn some fucking yellow skinnies looking like a fucking faggot\nBouncing 'round the house trying to find an easy way to rape Minnie\nBet you thirty dollars you find her like Cartman found Kenny, dead\nI like my girls smart, skinny\nKinda pop tart, when I bite into them red\nI'm a self-racist, you should tape this, ask Sarah, I'm the rapist\nI'm a fascist, fuck fashion, Gucci belts is for them faggots\nMy hat is by Jabbia, and if you got a fucking problem\nWith the future, you can get a death wish just like Atiba\nFuck the biz apparent, Odd Future errant\nI'm watching the Berrics getting head from someone's parent\nA lot of fucking hate inside my heart, guaranteed\nThat I'm sharing in the force with the cyclops staring\nI'm flying on a beaver, you're a disbeliever\nSo don't ask for no mothafuckin' ride when you see us\nSwim right past you, the shit-list said that I'm nutty such a cashew\nCause I jack off with dish soap and smell gas fumes\nPermanent brain damage similar to tattoos\nThe shit, you can mention me if anybody ask you\nKill the jungle let the cats loose\nYou didn't see me here if someone ask you\n\nI want to feel her in every way\nMary Jane keeps me high like every day\nBong, vaporizer, in the sack now\nStuck in my high, afraid of heights, I'm trapped\nBuy a swisher for a dollar or two blunt wraps\nRoll it up and ensure that everything's fat\nShe ain't got time to try and relieve ya\nBut she'll get all in your head, Sativa\n\nI'm good but y'all don't want me like vegetables\nI'm all in front of you zeroes like decimals\nLet's take them high like the decibels\nSo we get them high, get them high like cholesterol\nIn a overweight mother-lover, my tracks is filled with blubber\nThat's fat, who needs another producer?\nChica-Go-Getter from Odd Future, used to ride solo\nCause I ain't really care what the rest say\nType of nigga to jerk off to his own sex tape\nBest stay away when the door closed, I show up with four hoes\nBest believe I'm leaving with more of those\nAnd I got a girlfriend so I'm a keep lying until the verse end, FIN\nBrandun Deshay, Hodgy Beats, Ace the Creator\nOdd Future, O.F. until, until from now until forever\n\nWe grind, these niggas asking for some promo\nWe sit back, observe, stacking hella box logos\nSquare circle jerks starting O.F. moshpit\nPreaching to the poets, I'm an O.F. prophet\nNo less profit, fiened when we drop shit\nConvertible coupe, bitches scream when they tops split\nIt's that crack, give you something to sell\nPut these bitches on lock down, something like jail\nThought she hot I swear, probably rougher than hell\nAnd she ain't gay, but the only thing she like is fucking Chanel\nLight skinned women, all sex everything\nThink we can fit ten in, bowls packed with everything\nEverything that we call flight, living life\nThis is everything that we call hype\nI'm everything that they call nice\nShe in colors and shit, she off that northern lights, right\nIntimidated by niggas you can't be\nI'm a G, and this is something you can't see\nTop ranked, number one my son\nAnd she looking for them trees, baby we got some\nAnd stay focused on the women and you get less done\nIt's ironic cause I always hear you talking about one\nThem other niggas smoke, they ain't this high\nHow high? Nigga, higher than the kites they fly"}}, {"title": "Seven", "album": "Bastard", "year": "2009-12-25", "lyrics": "I'd tell him to eat a dick quicker than Mexicans sprint over borders\nI give a fuck like a quarter with 20 cent\nAt Hamptons with Fred Hampton relaxing at Happy Camper\nIt's the fucking financial aid at Hamptons wasn't relaxing\nI'm taxing, \"Fuck 'em all!\"'s what I'm chanting\nDon't complain I'm just ranting\nFuck ranking, I'm the best, I'm the champion's chariot\nI'm a liar like Carrey in Liar Liar\nI'm dirtier than the sheets in the Marriott\nCable guy like Larry, Peter Pan in my youth, fucking fairies\nI'm using my tooth bait to get that bitches teeth paste\nFuck it, Odd Future some Nazis, black Nazis don't copy\nWe perfect, you sloppy, hotter than Saki Takei\nFuck a label on my jacket, screw you like a ratchet\nScrew you like a black teen on Judge Hatchett\nHang with thrashers and jackers\nDrug dealers and crackers, AP students and slackers\nI'm backwards like Jermaine Dupri in '93\nEscaping from concentration camps with a fucking girl board and a ramp\nThat I ordered from CCS with some diamonds that's VVS\nLike I went to Sierra Leone in a homecoming dress\nWith some matching pink panties, lipstick from my granny\nSup on my hat like that motherfucker friendly\nWhite, red-headed bitch reminded me of Annie\nShe dino like my state of mind, so yeah she understand me\nFuck You Bunch is here, never disrespect my family\nThat\u2019s for my little brother, sister, cousin and my auntie\nWasted fucking youth?

I overheard\nA sword sliced the air, I pulled out the na-na\nRolled off the bed, then shot back, pow-pow\nBlood on the sheets, probably spillin' from my gash\nLooked out the glass, seen you sprintin' on the grass\nA real ninja, with the blade and the mask\nHad them gold ninja stars, and red Supreme nunchuks\nNow she tryna patch me up, but\nGirl, I was just tryna get a nut bust\nIf that's your ex, you should probably own a pistol\nBut I'm guessin' it's wiser to exit with dude\n\nThe blinds wide open so he can\nSee you in the dark when you're sleepin'\nNaked body, fresh out the shower\nYou touch yourself after hours\nAin't no man allowed in your bedroom\nYou're sleeping alone in bed\nBut check your window (Swag)\nHe's at your window\n\nNight light hits off, turnin' kisses to bites\nI'm a down to Earth nigga, with intentions, that's right\nYou'll be down in Earth quicker if you diss me tonight\nBut I'll be the happiest if you decide to kick it tonight\nWe can chill and I can act like I don't wanna fuck\nYou can tell me all your problems like I really give one\nBut I give two for us cause you're the one that I want\nDon't wanna seem like a punk pussy that simps over punk pussy\nSee when I'm with my friends I just put on a front\nBut in the back of my top I'm writing songs about we\nWe, as including I, and yourself, making three\nLittle ones, the drums are hitting pretty hard if you ask me\nYou're a pretty broad in the top three\nOf things that I've been waiting to come, so\nMeet me by the lake around 10 and skinny dippin' and then\nWe can begin the pretend game, I wanna be Finn\nFrom Adventurin' Time\n\nThe blinds wide open so he can\nSee you in the dark when you're sleepin'\nNaked body, fresh out the shower\nYou touch yourself after hours\nAin't no man allowed in your bedroom\nYou're sleeping alone in bed\nBut check your window (Swag)\nHe's at your window\n\nOne, two; you're the girl that I want\nThree, four, five, six, seven; shit\nEight is the bullets if you say no after all this\nAnd I just couldn't take it, you're so motherfuckin' gorgeous\nGorgeous, baby you're gorgeous\nI just wanna drag your lifeless body to the forest\nAnd fornicate with it\nBut that's because I'm in love with you, cunt\n\nI just wanna talk, and conversate\n'Cause I usually just stalk you and masturbate\nAnd I finally got the courage to ask you on a date\nSo just say yes, let the future fall into place (Cunt)\nI just wanna talk, and conversate\n'Cause I usually just stalk you and masturbate\nAnd I finally got the courage to ask you on a date\nSo just say yes, let the future

No, but if I gave a fuck\nDo you think I'd tell you? Fuck no! Kinda like my dad\nWhen he came home and told me he wanted to get my ass wet\nGoddamn that's gay but I'm not so fuck it I won't stop\nI keep sayin' this gay shit\nBut if you got a problem nigga, you don't gotta play it\nI need my damn inhaler cause I'm barely fuckin' breathing\nJackin' off semen everywhere up on the chair\nI put my jeans but fuck it I'll just go to Diamond and get another pair\nAnd if they got a problem, fuck it, go to 'preme and get a box logo fuckin' tee\nAnd motherfuckin' panties just to match, so when I can pee\nI can pull them fuckin' down and sit down and look at E\nFuckin' rectangles on my fuckin' G-string\nThat's fuckin' gay I know, goddamn that shit is tight but yo\nShout out to all my\ufeff niggas doing hardcore drugs\nAnd sockin' bitches out and shootin'

roll through the mall\nBuy every fuckin' thing and listen to Tina\nWhile we buy everything and listen to Tina\nWhile we buy everything and listen to Tina\nWhile we listen to Tina, I'mma buy everything\nAnd give way to fuckin' bums..\nMy lungs ain't got no fuckin' air\nSo if I fuckin' stop here, there\nI don't care if you do but if you do I don't care\nThat's not makin' sense, I'm a

Tamale! Tamale! Tamale!\nWhy y'all so salty? Hot tamale is on\nA can of beans, bitch, I'm on\nYour boy is bad to the bone\n\nBring back the horns that was played in the beginning\nAnd tell Tony Parker that I found his vision\nAnd if he's tripping off my sneak dissing\nThen he has to deal with me and my minions\nTryna get a bimmer, E46\nHave you heard \"48\", motherfucka I'm great\nGolf Wang prints always cover the sleeves\nFrom cuts for the Biebs, 'cause he's puffin' the trees, please\nFuck I look like? Got a new bike tire\nNever pop like the puss on a butch dyke\nThink I give a fuck, I do go raw\nThen I bust in her jaw like (Fuck that disease!)\nMy urethra, hole that I pee from\nBigger than the obese neck on Aretha\nNow turn that snare down\nI'm back like I'm Rosa Parks fare on the same damn bus\nLike, \"You're going to jail now!\"\n\nTamale! Tamale! Tamale! Tamale!\nWhy y'all so salty? Hot tamale is on\nA can of beans, bitch, I'm on\nYour boy is bad to the bone\n\nHow much wood could a woodchuck chuck?\nIf a woodchuck could ever give a fuck?\nBitch Suck Dick, motherfuck you and your opinions\n(Can you kick it?) Yes, I can sir, where the lump is\nSicker than the last bar bold-er, I\u2019m a CO\nColorado, fuck Michael, bitch, I\u2019m badder than my BO\nFind me and Lance tryna dance during chemo\nBefore they repossess our strong arm bands and tuxedos\n\nYeah, buddy, this is my jam, na na na na na na na!\nGolf Wang, Golf Wang, no, fuck you, na na na na na na!\nWhy y'all so salty? Hot tamale is on\nCan't agree? Bitch, I'm on\nYour boy is bad to the bone\n\nHow many fags can a lightbulb screw?\nWell if it has a dick, maybe two or six\nAnd tell the NRA I'm about to lose my shit\nShoot through Wayne LaPierre's hair with a crucifix\nHow many ladies in the house?\nHow many ladies in the house without a rich nigga, huh?\nA little Jergens in my palm for the jerkin'\nHope my mom don't catch me, tryna set mood\nLittle Redtube, fuck lotion, I don't need lube, dry fist suits me\nUp and down, the friction makes a squeaky sound, the shit's kind of disgusting\nFap time and before I flatline, Clancy chimes in my room and catch me\nThis shit's so damn embarrassing like...\n\nOh, shit, aw fuck\nWhat the fuck!\nAw, I'm sorry\nIs that my shirt?\nYeah, sorry, I needed something\nClean that shit up, we're going to the office!", "image": "https://images.genius.com/558cc26dbbd2446d98e703de868d2c80.600x600x1.png", "artist": "Tyler, The Creator", "raw": {"annotation_count": 44, "api_path": "/songs/133416", "description": {"dom": {"tag": "root", "children": [{"tag": "p", "children": [{"tag": "a", "attributes": {"href": "https://twitter.com/fucktyler/status/319296980201373696", "rel": "nofollow"}, "children": ["https://twitter.com/fucktyler/status/319296980201373696"]}]}, "", {"tag": "p"}, "", {"tag": "p", "children": [{"tag": "img", "attributes": {"src": "https://images.rapgenius.com/ee89f4bf7a8fcf43eb410c9a2e8553fe.198x500x1.jpg", "alt": "", "width": 198, "height": 500}, "data": {"animated": "false", "thumbnail": {"src": "https://images.rapgenius.com/ee89f4bf7a8fcf43eb410c9a2e8553fe.198x500x1.jpg", "height": 500, "width": 198}}}]}, "", {"tag": "p", "children": ["In the beginning of the music video there is a picture of a tamale."]}, "", {"tag": "p", "children": [{"tag": "img", "attributes": {"src": "https://images.rapgenius.com/33430b8a21cbd6e6a3206fb59f8d6a4d.1000x563x1.jpg", "alt": "", "width": 1000, "height": 563}, "data": {"animated": "false", "thumbnail": {"src": "https://images.rapgenius.com/33430b8a21cbd6e6a3206fb59f8d6a4d.300x169x1.jpg", "height": 169, "width": 300}}}]}, "", {"tag": "p", "children": ["NOTE: The price is $3.91 which is the month and year Tyler was born.

Give it up for \u2018em!\nWill y'all shut the fuck up?\nDamn, I\u2019m here\nAlright, let me configure this\nGet this ready\nAlright, let\u2019s go\n\nNigga seventeen his own fucking magazine\nAnd of course his Hunger Force is Aqua Teen by all means\nFuck a deal, signature is legible\nI'm the reason why niggas is heatin' up they vegetables\nFrom being bullied in the sixth, to being dissed by any bitch\nThat can breath, please throw me in a ditch\nAnd I hope I sell a copy of this disk\nFuck Hope, I am one short, a miracle of wish\nWhether you nigga or ese, the magazine is great\nBecause the articles an essay\nHalf you dumb niggas can't even write an essay\nCause all of ya'll some stupid asses, S.A\nYou motherfuckers in denial\nI'm the square just like the tile, right down the fucking isle\nMusic was my only friend, ever since I was a child\nI make niggas frown, just to give myself a smile\nMother was my father, the nigga didn't bother\nTo send a kid a dollar, my only role model was\nNiggas that record and that could play keyboards\nAnd wild piano chords make me happy\nDr. Suess more important than Jesus\nY'all immigrants to depression, nigga give me a visa\nWe sick, the same lames that sneeze us\nMade us turn to Jazz now, because the black kids would tease us\nI need a fucking chain, I need to make it rain\nI need some fucking rims, a car that I can rent\nA verse about swag, jeans sagging off my ass\nNo I don't, fuck that, I am not a fucking fag\nI rhyme and I'm still scared of guns\nIn the marching band but I bang my own drums and\nSing my own song, all of my wrongs are right\nNever got into a fight, hit me\nBass, drum, snare, let it go\nDisappear like good music in the past year\nAnd everybody do the same thing, I hear the same shit\nAll the time, like the radio is queer\nThis isn't a mixtape, it's more of ear rape\nBy kids who think you other niggas suck\nIt's very offensive, you niggas defensive\nIf you can't take the heat then get the fuck out the kitchen, listen\n\nTyler the Creator, Hodgy Beats, Super 3, Casey V, Left Brain\nEnjoy the show, good night, thank you, and fuck you"}}, {"title": "ThisNiggaAintFunnyAtAll", "album": null, "year":

lease bill, run flats when the feet peel\nFish tail, the boy eats meals, tummy ache from my cheap thrills\nGranny hug the way the seat feel, on the left turn, leave the neck burned\nFrom the frost bit links, size of an earth worm, wasted on last check earned\nI\u2019m, expecting this so it ain't odd, two 5\u2019s on the paint job, lactose, wide body, fat ghost\nGrannys watch over me when I act slow, rev till I plateau\nKeys sorted on the hip, jeff gordon is his mind, life\u2019s forza on the strip\nSwitch gears like I take breaths, wish I had 8\nLeft 6 got skipped, went to 7th from the 5th\nMore advance than your average\nI like coupes, two shit\nWhen my friends pull up, stops turn into a pageant\nBut until I get that enzo, its chapter uno\nBut I know what that bus pass turned into, its magic"}}, {"title": "Tron Cat", "album": "Goblin", "year": "2011-05-10", "lyrics": "La, la, la, la, la, la, la\nAAAAHHH!\n\nSatan's getting jealous of the wolves, the demons say they preferring us\nBooks on not giving a fuck is what they're referring us (Wolf Gang)\nWolves, I know you heard of us, we're murderers\nAnd young enough to get the fucking priest to come and flirt with us\nYou niggas rap about fucking bitches and getting head\nInstead I rap about fucking bitches and getting heads\nWhile you niggas stacking bread, I can stack a couple dead\nBodies, making red look less of a color, more of a hobby\nI'm not a rapper nor a rapist nor a racist\nI fuck bitches with no permission and tend to hate shit\nBrag about the actions in a rhyming pattern matter\nThen proceed to sat her down when I go splatter in her chatterbox\nAtta boy, Odd Future, you're not in our categore\nTorture with the super soaker at the asian liquor store\nThis the type of shit that make a Chris Brown want to kick a whore\nThat make songs about the wet blockers when it rains and pours\n(Umbrella) I hate this, screaming fuck patience\nGot a nigga shaking like the calmest fucking Haitian\nAfter chronic masturbation, asking where Mary-Kate went\nI want to be the reasons why all lesbians hate dick\nI make this damn Bullwinkle the red moose\nGame of duck-duck-duct tape with a dead goose\nShe running 'round this motherfucking dungeon, her legs loose\nUntil I accidentally get the saw to her head, oops\n\nVictim, victim, honey, you're my fifth one\nHoney on that topping when I stuff you in my system\nRape a pregnant bitch and tell my friends I had a threesome\nYou got a fucking death wish? I'm a genie, it'll get done\nNice to meet you, but it's more pleasant to eat you\nWith a leaf of salad and some dressing pouring out a teacup\nBitch, I'm Tyler the Creature, suck your feet up like a beach of leeches\nRubber more than the fucking bottom of a sneaker\nJeeper the fucking creeper, get your daughter and keep her\nIn the jeeps where the Wolf Gang rides around deeper\nTake her to Ladera, now she's scared and you're embarrassed\nFilled with terror, chop her legs off and tell her to run some errands\nPut her eyes in a canteen, take her to the Berrics\nStare at Steve, say it costs ten to fuck Eric\nPut her in the lake, her body sinks great, now it's time to fish her like Derek\nSatan says we're dangerous, we're trading kids for angel dust\nAnd snuff and sniff, and now that Michael Jackson's trying to suck our dick\nHippopot the fucking llamas, dead bodies, cheerleading squaders\nGave the team a bunch of fucking bees and the Keke Palmer\nThey will never catch him or catch up\nThey asked me what it was, I told them fuckers it was ketchup\nNutty like my Chex mix, she bleeding from her rectum\nOdd Future wolves stirring ruckus, throwing sets up, yep\n\nThis the type of shit that make children break in apartments\nWhen you tell a fucking orphan you don't love them 'til they heart thin\n(I hate you!) Starve her 'til I carve her then I shove her in the Rover\nWhere I cut her like a barber with a Parkinson's disorder\nStore her in a portable freezer with me to Portland\nCatch me with a bunch of fucking Mexicans crossing the border (arriba!)\nI'll be the only wetback who ain't really touched the water\nCause I'll be too fucking busy tryna flirt with Jesus' daughter\n(Fuck Mary) I'm awesome, and I fuck dolphins\nSicker than the starving Nigerian kids barfing\nOdd Future Wolf Gang Nazi bar mitzvah\nWith your sister at the bar playing leg and arm twister\nEvident that I'm the shit, I'm the Pooh like Tigger dick\nI got these cracker doctors saying, \"yeah Bob, this nigga's sick\"\nAnimal safari, if I offend you I'm sorry\nBecause I'm the blackest skinhead since India Arie\nI don't smoke weed, so no need for the matches\nI said fuck coke and now I'm snorting Hitler's ashes\nI plan on either dying for suicide or my asthma\nBeing the only bastard in a box logo casket\nRashes on my dick from licks of shishkabob Sagets\nIn some Kanye West glasses screaming out \"fuck faggots\"\nCatch me in my attic taking photos of my dad's dick\nDrop the beat here to make it extra climactic\n\nWhat the fuck?\nI'm speechless, that was, fuck\nShit, Tyler, you're gonna need some help\nI'm not a.. fuck it, different subject\nHow's that girl you were telling me about?", "image":

fuck is what they're referring us (Wolf Gang)\nWolves, I know you heard of us, we're murderers\nAnd young enough to get the fucking priest to come and flirt with us\nYou niggas rap about fucking bitches and getting head\nInstead I rap about fucking bitches and getting heads\nWhile you niggas stacking bread, I can stack a couple dead\nBodies, making red look less of a color, more of a hobby\nI'm not a rapper nor a rapist nor a racist\nI fuck bitches with no permission and tend to hate shit\nBrag about the actions in a rhyming pattern matter\nThen proceed to sat her down when I go splatter in her chatterbox\nAtta boy, Odd Future, you're not in our categore\nTorture with the super soaker at the asian liquor store\nThis the type of shit that make a Chris Brown want to kick a whore\nThat make songs about the wet blockers when it rains and pours\n(Umbrella) I hate this, screaming fuck patience\nGot a nigga shaking like the calmest fucking Haitian\nAfter chronic masturbation, asking where Mary-Kate went\nI want to be the reasons why all lesbians hate dick\nI make this damn Bullwinkle the red moose\nGame of duck-duck-duct tape with a dead goose\nShe running 'round this motherfucking dungeon, her legs loose\nUntil I accidentally get the saw to her head, oops\n\nVictim, victim, honey, you're my fifth one\nHoney on that topping when I stuff you in my system\nRape a pregnant bitch and tell my friends I had a threesome\nYou got a fucking death wish? I'm a genie, it'll get done\nNice to meet you, but it's more pleasant to eat you\nWith a leaf of salad and some dressing pouring out a teacup\nBitch, I'm Tyler the Creature, suck your feet up like a beach of leeches\nRubber more than the fucking bottom of a sneaker\nJeeper the fucking creeper, get your daughter and keep her\nIn the jeeps where the Wolf Gang rides around deeper\nTake her to Ladera, now she's scared and you're embarrassed\nFilled with terror, chop her legs off and tell her to run some errands\nPut her eyes in a canteen, take her to the Berrics\nStare at Steve, say it costs ten to fuck Eric\nPut her in the lake, her body sinks great, now it's time to fish her like Derek\nSatan says we're dangerous, we're trading kids for angel dust\nAnd snuff and sniff, and now that Michael Jackson's trying to suck our dick\nHippopot the fucking llamas, dead bodies, cheerleading squaders\nGave the team a bunch of fucking bees and the Keke Palmer\nThey will never catch him or catch up\nThey asked me what it was, I told them fuckers it was ketchup\nNutty like my Chex mix, she bleeding from her rectum\nOdd Future wolves stirring ruckus, throwing sets up, yep\n\nThis the type of shit that make children break in apartments\nWhen you tell a fucking orphan you don't love them 'til they heart thin\n(I hate you!) Starve her 'til I carve her then I shove her in the Rover\nWhere I cut her like a barber with a Parkinson's disorder\nStore her in a portable freezer with me to Portland\nCatch me with a bunch of fucking Mexicans crossing the border (arriba!)\nI'll be the only wetback who ain't really touched the water\nCause I'll be too fucking busy tryna flirt with Jesus' daughter\n(Fuck Mary) I'm awesome, and I fuck dolphins\nSicker than the starving Nigerian kids barfing\nOdd Future Wolf Gang Nazi bar mitzvah\nWith your sister at the bar playing leg and arm twister\nEvident that I'm the shit, I'm the Pooh like Tigger dick\nI got these cracker doctors saying, \"yeah Bob, this nigga's sick\"\nAnimal safari, if I offend you I'm sorry\nBecause I'm the blackest skinhead since India Arie\nI don't smoke weed, so no need for the matches\nI said fuck coke and now I'm snorting Hitler's ashes\nI plan on either dying for suicide or my asthma\nBeing the only bastard in a box logo casket\nRashes on my dick from licks of shishkabob Sagets\nIn some Kanye West glasses screaming out \"fuck faggots\"\nCatch me in my attic taking photos of my dad's dick\nDrop the beat here to make it extra climactic\n\nWhat the fuck?\nI'm speechless, that was, fuck\nShit, Tyler, you're gonna need some help\nI'm not a.. fuck it, different subject\nHow's that girl you were telling me about?"}}, {"title": "Tyler the Creator Acapella Freestyle on Sway in the Morning", "album": null, "year": "2013-03-08", "lyrics": "Verse:\nListen\nListen\nListen\nBad ass bitch\nBig ass titties man\nGot fucking AKs the size of a fucking mini van\n(Wooo)\nListen\nYa'll niggas got problems then ya'll do it\nSo much fucking money in my pocket\nI fucking walk stoooopidd\nHold up\nBad bitch look good in some nice pants\nBet my bitch look good in some nice pants\nNiggas see me they be \"shit got damn , AK-47 tucked in that nigga nice pants!!\"\nHold on\nYa'll got a little nigga started on some G-Shit\n\"Who that nigga that looked swagged out?\"\nTHATS ME BITCH !\nDon't play with a nigga money or it's fucking family\nI got goon niggas named Jonathan and one named Tammy\nYa'll niggas got a fucking problem say it to my fucking face\nGot lil' niggas that'll sock you in the fucking face\nAnd if you think that they won't sock you in your fucking face\nAye you a BI-ahhhhh !! pop you right in your fucking face\n(DAAAAAMMMNN)", "image": "https://images.genius.com/ec57b5b9d577521808d9453d1e6d9b1b.512x512x1.png", "artist": "Tyler, The Creator", "raw": {"annotation_count": 13, "api_path": "/songs/135943", "description": {"dom": {"tag": "root", "children": [{"tag": "p", "children": ["Incredible Sway Freestyle by Tyler.

SCHOOL AT HAWTHORNE HIGH, SPENDING MOST OF MY NIGHTS TRYING TO FIND ANY SNIPPETS OF THE ALBUM ON VARIOUS GERMAN SITES. THEN 7/25/06 CAME. IMM RANGES IN DIFFERENT STYLES AND SOUNDS AND I BELIEVE THATS WHY I GRAVITATED TO IT SO MUCH\nTHE UPRIGHT BASSLINE ON \u201cCAN I HAVE IT LIKE THAT\u201d OR THE BUCKETS ON \u201cHOW DOES IT FEEL\u201d. OFF THE WALL MJ ON \u201cNUMBER 1\u2033. I STILL TO THIS DAY DONT THINK I CAN MAKE A SONG BETTER THAN \u201cTHAT GIRL\u201d. AND \u201cI REALLY LIKE YOU GIRL\u201d IS EASILY THE BEST SONG ON THIS ALBUM WITH YOUR BEST TIMBERLAKE IMPERSONATION AND STEVIE HARMONICA. IMM ALSO INCLUDES \u201cRASPY SHIT\u201d WHICH IS THE WORST SONG IN YOUR DISCOGRAPHY I HATE THAT SONG SO MUCH YOU ARE SO GROSS FOR THAT. BUT THE ONE THAT STOOD OUT WAS \u201cYOU CAN DO IT TOO\u201d. THE SADE BASSLINE, THE STRING PAD WITH CHORDS THAT YOU CLAIM ONLY Q-TIP, YOU AND I LIKE, THE JAMIE CULLUM OUTRO!\nBEING 15 BLACK NOT REALLY \u201cINTERESTED\u201d IN WHAT THE MAJORITY OF MY PEERS WERE INTO, IT MADE ME FEEL SAFE. I WAS OPTIMISTIC, ALWAYS DAYDREAMING AND SETTING GOALS SO I FELT YOU WERE DIRECTLY SPEAKING TO ME. I REMEMBER CLANCY TELLING ME HOW JIMMY IOVINE THOUGHT THIS ALBUM WAS A \u201cCOMPLETE FUCKING FAILURE IT DIDNT WORK\u201d\nBUT SEE, IT DID, JUST NOT ON THE KIDS HE WAS LOOKING AT. THE ONES WHO JUST EXISTED;USED THE POPULAR SLANG;LISTENED TO WHAT WAS THROWN AT THEM;DRESSED IN CLOTHING THAT WAS TRENDING AT THE TIME. NOT SAYING THATS BAD BUT OF COURSE THIS WOULDNT WORK ON THEM. BUT IT WORKED ON ME AND I CREATED ODD FUTURE THAT SAME SUMMER. I WAS ACTUALLY NAIVE ENOUGH TO BELIEVE YOU AND THOUGHT I COULD DO ALL THESE AMAZING THINGS IF I REALLY TRIED. WHERE I GREW UP, NIGGAS GET STUCK AND NEVER MAKE IT OUT. JAIL, DEAD, SHIT JOBS, NOT REALLY GROWING\nIT SEEMS LIKE AT A CERTAIN AGE, IDEAS; ORIGINAL THOUGHTS ARE NO LONGER A THING; I DIDNT FALL INTO THAT CYCLE. I\u2019M NOW A YOUNG ENTREPRENEUR ALL BECAUSE I BELIEVED YOU WHEN YOU SAID I COULD BE. YOU WERE THE FIRST PERSON I CONTACTED WHEN I PULLED OFF THAT MCLAREN DEALERSHIP! THIS IS GETTING LONG SO UHHH, HBD IMM. I NEVER HAD BROTHERS,UNCLES OR MY FATHER AROUND SO THANK YOU FOR BEING THE MALE FIGURE I GRAVITATED TO.

AND \u201cI REALLY LIKE YOU GIRL\u201d IS EASILY THE BEST SONG ON THIS ALBUM WITH YOUR BEST TIMBERLAKE IMPERSONATION AND STEVIE HARMONICA. IMM ALSO INCLUDES \u201cRASPY SHIT\u201d WHICH IS THE WORST SONG IN YOUR DISCOGRAPHY I HATE THAT SONG SO MUCH YOU ARE SO GROSS FOR THAT. BUT THE ONE THAT STOOD OUT WAS \u201cYOU CAN DO IT TOO\u201d.

I REMEMBER CLANCY TELLING ME HOW JIMMY IOVINE THOUGHT THIS ALBUM WAS A \u201cCOMPLETE FUCKING FAILURE IT DIDNT WORK\u201d\nBUT SEE, IT DID, JUST NOT ON THE KIDS HE WAS LOOKING AT. THE ONES WHO JUST EXISTED;USED THE POPULAR SLANG;LISTENED TO WHAT WAS THROWN AT THEM;DRESSED IN CLOTHING THAT WAS TRENDING AT THE TIME. NOT SAYING THATS BAD BUT OF COURSE THIS WOULDNT WORK ON THEM. BUT IT WORKED ON ME AND I CREATED ODD FUTURE THAT SAME SUMMER. I WAS ACTUALLY NAIVE ENOUGH TO BELIEVE YOU AND THOUGHT I COULD DO ALL THESE AMAZING THINGS IF I REALLY TRIED. WHERE I GREW UP, NIGGAS GET STUCK AND NEVER MAKE IT OUT. JAIL, DEAD, SHIT JOBS, NOT REALLY GROWING\nIT SEEMS LIKE AT A CERTAIN AGE, IDEAS; ORIGINAL THOUGHTS ARE NO LONGER A THING; I DIDNT FALL INTO THAT CYCLE. I\u2019M NOW A YOUNG ENTREPRENEUR ALL BECAUSE I BELIEVED YOU WHEN YOU SAID I COULD BE. YOU WERE THE FIRST PERSON I CONTACTED WHEN I PULLED OFF THAT MCLAREN DEALERSHIP! THIS IS GETTING LONG SO UHHH, HBD IMM. I NEVER HAD BROTHERS,UNCLES OR MY FATHER AROUND SO THANK YOU FOR BEING THE MALE FIGURE I GRAVITATED TO.

I'm a slip it in the tape deck\nBut put it in slow-mo, I don't want to bust the tape yet, press play\nNow this is what I call an evening\nA live show, almost equivalent to the screening\nYour dream movie? I'm the clearest copy\nNow time for Blow, I'm Johnny deep with the rarest poppy\nSnort a little, now you're getting groovy\nCause I'll kill if I find out you're watching some other movies, bitch\n\nPress my buttons baby\nPress my fucking buttons\nPress my buttons baby\nYeah\nPress my buttons baby\nPress my fucking buttons baby\nPress my buttons baby\nYeah\nPress my buttons baby\nPress my fucking buttons baby\nPress this\nStop!\nPart 2 - Wheels\n\nDanielle, Danielle, yeah you heard about Raquel\nWell that didn't go well, let us try to make it swell\nPut the beaver in the mail, we can take it slow like snail\nLock my heart up, this is jail, throw away the key\n\nCan I sleep over, and wake up next to you?\nI want to feel you near, just let me whisper in your ear, um\n\nWe can kick it on the couch, blunt you can roll it up\nBut I'm on some shrooms if you really want to feel the room\nI just want to kick it, kick it for the rest\nI skated all day, I just need some rest and your breasts\n\nCan I sleep over, and wake up next to you?\nI want to feel you near, just let me whisper in your ear, um\n\nWe can count the stars on the hood of your father's car\nHe's a buster anyway, I can take him any day\nLook into your eyes I realize that I like you so much\nThat was corny, now I'm horny, can I have a kiss?\n\nCan I sleep over, and wake up next to you?\nI want to feel you near, just let me whisper in your ear, um\n\nWe both teenagers with the same mind state\nHow about some ice cream and some South Park for this first date?\nYour cat is waiting for that raw fish I can't wait, get it?\n\nCan I sleep over, and wake up next to you?\nI want to feel you near, just let me whisper in your ear, um"}}, {"title": "We Got Bitches", "album": "The OF Tape Vol. 2", "year": "2012-03-20", "lyrics": "Goddamn nigga!\nThis shit ignorant as fuck, my nigga!\nBitches, this your motherfuckin' chance\nGo on the motherfuckin' dance floor, shake that ass bitch\nIf you got a problem with a nigga\nSock that motherfucker in the motherfuckin jaw right now nigga\nIf you didn't know nigga, if you didn't know nigga, I'm back!\n\nSpit on a bitch, punch on a bitch\nAfter I eat some steak, have her tug on my dick\nNigga filthy rich, two car notes\nNo house nigga, that's how I roll\nYeah nigga I do this fuckin' shit\nCount money, get my hair braided by your bitch\nShe drivin' me around town, nigga\nWhere I'm at nigga?

dreamed that I could afford\nNow I roll through Okaga\n\nI ride to California\nThese frog oval goggles\nI'm leaning out the window\nOJ shining on me\nSimp sun shining on me\nSlick wheels roll

I bloom, I glow (I glow)\nI rock, I roll (One more time), I bloom, I grow\n(Let's go!)\n\nAin't nobody fucking with T, but that just may be my ego\nBut don't be too cool, you may freeze\nBecause niggas get stuck in the cold (Man, look at this ice)\nShit weighs a ton, water your garden my nigga and stunt\n(Stunt on these niggas)\nTell these black kids they could be who they are\nDye your hair blue, shit, I'll do it too\nLook, I smell like Chanel\nI never mall grip with my manicured nails\nI coconut oil the skin\nI keep the top low 'cause the follicles thinnin'\nBut other than that, man, it feels like I'm winning\nWent from statistic to millionaire\nCNN doubted 'cause my skin is dark\nThen they forget when I get in my car\n\nThese frog oval goggles\nI'm leaning out the window\nOJ shining on me\nSimp sun shining on me\nSlick wheels roll float\nOut this world\nYeah, yeah\nRun it, run it, run it, yeah\n\nI glow (I glow)\nI rock, I roll (What you say?), I bloom, I glow (I glow)\nI rock, I

while, nigga making leaves\nKeep 'em in the branches so my family can eat\nFavorite color green, energy is strong\nGiving niggas life like birdies and the beez\nDropping them seeds, not what you

talk to you\nBecause, they're really worried about you\nI thought it would be better if, they could talk to you\n\nIt was all a dream, I used to read Complex magazines\nWhen I rhyme I'm tryna get pictures in High Times\nSmoke trees and see my dreams hanging in the sky line\nSwanton bomb off the bed into a fine dime\nIn my mind I'm just tryna smoke the finest\nAnd get high sticking bad heinas in vaginas\nI'm the flyest when it come to this, fire when I come to spit\nI am getting higher when the lighter comes in front of this\nI'm a stoner yeah, yeah, yeah you get the picture now\n30 thousand feet gon' make it hard for me to simmer down\nAnother flight, another beat, another city, wow\nThus another couple bitches crying when I kick 'em out\nWhere we at? We on top of the world\n\nAnd five minutes from suicide, I biked it to the park\nI walked onto the block, met a guy, burgundy 'Preme snap-back\nHurling himself at cars, and flirting with blonde Cadillacs\nAll was gray, all was gray, Frankie had the blues in fact\nBunch of pale hipster girls, pretty, but they booty flat\nTeenage males, couldn't tell I was going through it\nHad a wallet full of cream, Amex Green, Beamer almost black\nParked in front the studio Bastard's recorded at\nEarl, Gilbert, Tyler, Hodgy, Domo, Left, Taco, Nakel\nSydney, Lionel, Juan, Michael, Jasper, Hal and Matt\nBet I'm missing several but I had to bring that pattern back\nWe live inside a house that says fuck 'em on the welcome mat\nDeep inside the ear canals of Bill O'Reilly's daughter that's\nWhere I'm at? Now where we at? Wolf Gang, where we at?\n\nSwell motions get promotions, to my whole team\nHell yeah I smoke weed cause I like to go green\nProfessor Beats educates niggas, let me proceed\nShine chandelier bright might make your nose bleeds\nWe at Randy's ordering that 306\nMilk and glaze is the greed gold mix me\nYour bitch is coming along, yeah she hum to my song\nSinging like they were for her, but they were for the blur\nNo longer, but we were in premature, immature\nShe's unsure, I'm for sure, blouse and dress and my shirt\nOn the floor then pick it up, out the door, door\nChased, an imaginary friend, a reverie absorption\nImpregnate the dream 'til it has an abortion\nWhere we at? We on top of the world\n\nEverything they say I'd never have, I'm seeing\nNow, I bet they see that we balling like All-Star Weekend\nAlways been the most cool, they chase our shade\nThey say life switches pace when you got shit made\nSo I'm just tryna get paid, don't you remember the days\nWhen your dreams were the only thing that kept you sane\nAnd too often they think that they could stop me\nNow every show we makin' half a Maserati\nAnd the only thing blocking me is paparazzi\nNow it's gold Rolex's if they try to clock me\nEverything stays in the box like fighters in hockey\nMiss me if you're thinking we slack, work hard\nI got the world saying every single Friday is black\nTook your bitch, you ain't getting her back, cause she know\nWhere we at nigga? We on top of the world\n\nWhere we at, niggas?\nWhere the fuck we at, man? You niggas don't know me, huh\nWhere we at?\n\nDown to fucking Earth, huh, down to fucking Earth, huh\nFuck everybody, here goes some extra girth Sir\nYou fucking critics are making my nerves hurt\nSince I'm saying fuck everybody I guess that I'm a fucking pervert\nMy window is a book and I'm a fucking crook\nStealing phones to call home but the line is off the hook\nMy mom ain't paid the bill, guess I can't pay it either\nI ain't signed a fucking deal yet\nBut when I do Clancy and Dave are taking percentages\nThat could pay the whole fucking city's mortgage\nHopefully I make a lot of porridge from touring in fucking Oregon\nFrom playing piano organs and hopefully I can pay the bill\nShit is getting real, people begin to feel\nLike I'm changing, but their complaining making big fucking deals\nAbout some shit, they bitch and pout\n(Can we get backstage man?) No, faggot, it's sold out\n(Come on why you holding out, I though we was boys, without me\nYou wouldn't be Tyler the Creator, you're from the Dirty\nI can tell whenever you perform, a leopard can't change it's spots)\nBut I'm a fucking unicorn (Whatever man)\nLook, you can't stop me, I'm going full monty\nFuck that, I'm Hitler, everyone's a fucking Nazi\nWolf Gi-di-dang you be roaming where the fox be\nAnd I be where, anybody cares\nI try to preach \"Fuck age, live dreams and have fun\"\n(Here\u2019s some give a fuck, cake) Oh, maybe I should have some\n(Asshole, have none) How can I wake up on the wrong side\nOf the bed, when I don't even fucking have one?\nWhen I'm on that stage I feel important\nA whole fucking assortment of children that's taking Ritalin\nBecause the teacher said that the therapist wasn't feeling him\nYou gotta be fucking kidding me\nAt school I was a zero, now I'm every boy's hero and they fear it\nYou can hear it when that little fuck is reciting my lyrics, yeah I'm rebel nigga\nCheer it, dead parents everywhere, it's smelling like teen spirit\nOkay, fuck it, Elvis has left the building"}}, {"title": "Wolf", "album": "Wolf", "year": "2013-04-01", "lyrics": "You are a whore, you are a whore\nFuck you, fuck you, fuck you, fuck him\nFuck everything else I can see\nI know, fuck you I hate you so fucking much\nI know you think I'm crazy\nCause I think you\u2019re a fucking fag\n\n\"Sam, the music sounds good, man!

motherfuckin' Flintstone\nMaking crack rocks outta pussy nigga fishbones\nThis nigga Jasper tryin' to get grown\nAbout 5, 7 of his bitches in my bedroom\nSwallow the cinnamon\nI'ma scribble this sin and shit\nWhile Syd is tellin' me that she's been gettin' intimate with men (Syd, shut the fuck up)\nHere's the number to my therapist (Shit)\nYou tell him all your problems, he's fuckin' awesome with listenin'\n\nWolf Haley, Golf Wang\nWolf Haley, Golf fuckin' Wang\n\nJesus called, he said he's sick of the disses\nI told him to quit bitchin', this isn't a fuckin' hotline\nFor a fuckin' shrink,

9's\nThis ain't no V.

I slipped myself some pink Xannies (Yeah)\nAnd danced around the house in all-over print panties\nMy mom's gone, that fuckin' broad will never understand me\nI'm not gay, I just wanna boogie to some Marvin\n(What you think of Hayley Williams?)\nFuck her, Wolf Haley robbin' them\nI'll crash that fuckin' airplane that that faggot nigga B.o.B is in\nAnd stab Bruno Mars in his goddamn esophagus\nAnd won't stop until the cops come in\nI'm an overachiever, so how about I start a team of leaders\nAnd pick up Stevie Wonder to be the wide receiver? (Cool)\nGreen paper, gold teeth, and pregnant golden retrievers\nAll I want \u2013 Fuck money, diamonds, and bitches; don't need 'em\nBut where the fat ones at? I got somethin' to feed 'em\nIt's some cooking books, the black kids never wanted to read 'em\nSnap back, green ch-ch-chia fuckin' leaves\nIt's been a couple months\nAnd Tina still ain't perm her fuckin' weave\nDamn\n\nWolf Haley, Golf Wang\nWolf Haley, Golf Wang, yeah\nGoddamn goblin\nWolf Haley, Golf Wang\nWolf Haley, Golf Wang, yeah\n\nThey say success is the best revenge\nSo I beat DeShay up with the stack of magazines I'm in\nOh, not again!

crack rocks outta pussy nigga fishbones\nThis nigga Jasper tryin' to get grown\nAbout 5, 7 of his bitches in my bedroom\nSwallow the cinnamon\nI'ma scribble this sin and shit\nWhile Syd is tellin' me that she's been gettin' intimate with men (Syd, shut the fuck up)\nHere's the number to my therapist (Shit)\nYou tell him all your problems, he's fuckin' awesome with listenin'\n\nWolf Haley, Golf Wang\nWolf Haley, Golf fuckin' Wang\n\nJesus called, he said he's sick of the disses\nI told him to quit bitchin', this isn't a fuckin' hotline\nFor a fuckin' shrink, sheesh, I already got mine\nAnd he's not fuckin' workin', I think I'm wastin' my damn time\nI'm clockin' three past six and goin' postal\nThis the revenge of the dicks; that's nine cocks that cock 9's\nThis ain't no V. Tech shit, or Columbine\nBut after bowling, I went home for some damn Adventure Time\n(What'd you do?) I slipped myself some pink Xannies (Yeah)\nAnd danced around the house in all-over print panties\nMy mom's gone, that fuckin' broad will never understand me\nI'm not gay, I just wanna boogie to some Marvin\n(What you think of Hayley Williams?)\nFuck her, Wolf Haley robbin' them\nI'll crash that fuckin' airplane that that faggot nigga B.o.B is in\nAnd stab Bruno Mars in his goddamn esophagus\nAnd won't stop until the cops come in\nI'm an overachiever, so how about I start a team of leaders\nAnd pick up Stevie Wonder to be the wide receiver? (Cool)\nGreen paper, gold teeth, and pregnant golden retrievers\nAll I want \u2013 Fuck money, diamonds, and bitches; don't need 'em\nBut where the fat ones at? I got somethin' to feed 'em\nIt's some cooking books, the black kids never wanted to read 'em\nSnap back, green ch-ch-chia fuckin' leaves\nIt's been a couple months\nAnd Tina still ain't perm her fuckin' weave\nDamn\n\nWolf Haley, Golf Wang\nWolf Haley, Golf Wang, yeah\nGoddamn goblin\nWolf Haley, Golf Wang\nWolf Haley, Golf Wang, yeah\n\nThey say success is the best revenge\nSo I beat DeShay up with the stack of magazines I'm in\nOh, not again! Another critic writing report\nI'm stabbin' any bloggin' faggot hipster with a Pitchfork\nStill suicidal I am\nI'm Wolf, Tyler put this fuckin' knife in my hand\nI'm Wolf, Ace gon' put that fuckin' hole in my head\nAnd I'm Wolf, that was me who shoved a cock in your bitch\n(What the fuck, man?) Fuck the fame and all the hype, G\nI just wanna know if my father would ever like me\nBut I don't give a fuck, so he's probably just like me\nA motherfuckin' Goblin\n(Fuck everything, man) That's what my conscience said\nThen it bunny-hopped off my shoulder, now my conscience dead\nNow the only guidance that I had is splattered on cement\nActions speak louder than words, let me try this shit\nDead"}}, {"title": "Yonkers [Music Video]", "album": "Goblin", "year": "2011-02-10", "lyrics": "Tyler is shown in black and white sitting on a stool in an all white room. The camera shakes slightly, bringing Tyler in and out of focus.\nTyler begins to rap, miming the words as he says them. He lifts his hand up, and we see a Madagascar Cockroach climbing on his fingers. The cockroach climbs to his other hand, and Tyler stares at it intently as he raps.\nIt crawls over his hand, and then onto his other hand again. Tyler brings his hand up and looks down on the cockroach, and we see the word \"Kill\" written in sharpie on the back of his hand. We also see an upside-down cross drawn on his middle knuckle.\nThe cockroach climbs to the edge of his hand and it crawls onto his other hand, and Tyler stares at the camera.\nTyler brings the hand with the cockroach down, out of the view of the camera. He brings it back up in between his fingers and puts it in his mouth.\nHe chews, and the camera begins panning out, bringing Tyler in and out of focus. He makes a face of disgust, and stands up from the stool, heaving.\nTyler becomes a silhouette, and he throws up onto the floor. It takes a while, and then he wipes his mouth and spits onto the floor. He sits up on the stool and he comes back into focus.\nHe begins rapping again, pausing to spit on the ground again. The camera slowly pans in until the upper half of his body is showing. He begins unbuttoning his shirt.\nHe unbuttons his shirt all the way and then his gestures become very animated. He grabs his face in rage, showing that he is wearing a chain. He then takes his shirt off  all the way.\nThe camera zooms in to Tyler's face, with the image becoming extremely blurry and then in sharp focus. We see that Tyler's eyes are dark black, and then we see only Tyler's teeth, then his eyes again. Tyler gives the camera the middle finger.\nTyler begins to move around a lot, agitated, grabbing his chain. He becomes completely out of view at one point, then when he comes back into view, his nose begins to bleed. He wipes the blood off his top lip.\nThe camera zooms out, and a noose falls from the ceiling. Tyler grabs the noose and wraps it around his neck. He stands on the stool, and we only see his feet.\nThe stool falls over, and the legs begin thrashing, as Tyler hangs from the noose (out of view). His legs twitch as his legs swing back and forth.\nThe camera moves to see the stool on the ground and Tyler's feet dangling. The feet finally stop twitching, and they just sway around in a circle. The camera shifts in and out of focus.

The cockroach climbs to his other hand, and Tyler stares at it intently as he raps.\nIt crawls over his hand, and then onto his other hand again.

We also see an upside-down cross drawn on his middle knuckle.\nThe cockroach climbs to the edge of his hand and it crawls onto his other hand, and Tyler stares at the camera.\nTyler brings the hand with the cockroach down, out of the view of the camera. He brings it back up in between his fingers and puts it in his mouth.\nHe chews, and the camera begins panning out, bringing Tyler in and out of focus. He makes a face of disgust, and stands up from the stool, heaving.\nTyler becomes a silhouette, and he throws up onto the floor. It takes a while, and then he wipes his mouth and spits onto the floor. He sits up on the stool and he comes back into focus.\nHe begins rapping again, pausing to spit on the ground again. The camera slowly pans in until the upper half of his body is showing. He begins unbuttoning his shirt.\nHe unbuttons his shirt all the way and then his gestures become very animated.

somethin'...\n\nWhat's the point of bein' rich when you wake up alone?\nWhat's the point of goin' home when it ain't nobody there?\nFuck that, I grab my bike and phone home in the air\nAnd I pedal through the city with the wide frame steer\nWith that tall pale boy that I met last year\nGrape, that's what I call him, love, that's what I fall in\nFell in, I ain't like sports growing up, but now I'm ballin'\nI guess I'm a late bloomer\nAyo, look, high tide bottoms 'cause the neck on lunar\nThem GOLF le FLEUR unos 'cause, we don't do Puma, nah\n20k pairs, gone in 3 seconds\nYou ain't gotta like him and you ain't gotta respect him\nFor playin' chess with these niggas\nThat think that they're bench pressin'\nLeg day is getting skipped, guess who really runnin' shit?\nYoung Teezy, it ain't easy, feelin' wheezy in this bitch\nNew slaves got y'all niggas feelin' breezy on the ship\nPour a Fanta in your poison so its easier to sip, huh?\nMy shit leaked two weeks before that release date\nFirst week, did dos, a thousand off, beat Meek\nShout out Meek! Two niggas first week top 3!\nAnd I can't even get a song to play on the radio\nBut tripled in them ratings, TV channels still pay me tho, haha\nP told me not to trip\nI am in my Ziploc, nigga\nFeel like I got the best album out, uh\nI know I got the best album out, preach\n\nLet me, let me hear that"}}], "artist": "Tyler, The Creator"}
