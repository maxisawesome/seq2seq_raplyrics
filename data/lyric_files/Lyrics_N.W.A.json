But they're somewhere in the immediate vicinity\n\nA 100 miles and runnin' -  MC Ren, I hold the gun and\nYou want me to kill a mutherfucker and it's done in\nSince I'm stereotyped to kill and destruct -\nIs one of the main reasons I don't give a fuck\nChances are usually not good\n'Cause I'm frisked with my hands on a hot hood\nAnd gettin' jacked by the you-know-who\nWhen in a black and white the capacity is two\nWe're not alone, we're three more brothers, I mean street-brothers\nNot wearing medallions, 'cause we're not stupid, mutherfuckers\nThey're out to take our heads for what we said in the past\nPoint blank, they can kiss my black ass\nI didn't stutter when I said \"Fuck Tha Police\"\n'Cause it's hard for a nigga to get peace\nNow it's broken and can't be fixed\n'Cause police and little black niggas don't mix so\nNow I'm creepin' through the fall\nRunnin' like a G, we'll see, I might have slayed y'all\nSo for now pack the gun and\nHold it in the air 'cause MC Ren has a 100 miles of runnin'\n\nInto this news. Four fugitives are on the run\nFBI sources tell us that the four are headed\n100 miles to their homebase, Compton\n\nLend me a mutherfuckin' ear\nSo I can tell you why\n\nRunnin' with my brothers, headed for the homebase\nWith a steady pace on the face that just reads race\nThe road ahead goes on and on\nThe shit is gettin' longer than the mutherfuckin' marathon\nRunnin' on but never runnin' out\nStayin' wired and if I get tired, I can still try out\nHitchhikin' if that's what it gotta do\nBut nobody's pickin' up a Nigga Witta Attitude\nConfused, yo but Dre's a nigga with nuthin' to lose\nOne of the few who's been accused and abused\nOf the crime of poisonin' young minds\nBut you don't know shit til you been in my shoes\nAnd Dre is back from the C-P-T\nDroppin' some shit that's D-O-P-E\nSo fuck the P-O-L-I-C-E!\nAnd any mutherfucker that disagrees\nStuck and runnin' hard, hauling ass\n'Cause I been a nigga known for havin' a notorious past\nMy mind was slick - my temper was too quick\nNow the FBI's all over my dick\n\nGot the stick and runnin' just to find the gun that started the clock\nThat's when the E jumped off the startin' block\nA 100 miles from home and, yo, it's a long stretch\nA little sprintin' mutherfucker that they won't catch\nYeah, back to Compton again\nYo, it's either that or the Federal pen\n'Cause niggas been runnin' since beginning of time\nTakin' a minute to tell you what's on my mutherfuckin' mind\nRunnin' like I just don't care\nCompton's 50 miles but, yo, I'mma get there\nArchin' my back and on a straight route\nJust like Carl Lewis I'm ballin' the fuck out\nFrom city to city I'm a menace as I pass by\nRippin' up shit just so you can remember I'm\nA straight up nigga that's done in, gunnin' and comin'\nStraight at yo ass, a 100 miles and runnin'\n\nThis one goes out to the four brothers from Compton\nYou're almost there, but the FBI has a little message for you:\nNowhere to run to, baby. Nowhere to hide\nGood luck brothers\n\nRunnin' like a nigga I hate to lose\nShow me on the news but I hate to be abused\nI know it was a set-up - So now I'm gonna get up\nEven if the FBI wants me to shut up\nBut I've got 10 000 niggas strong\nThey got everybody singin' my \"Fuck Tha Police\" song\nAnd while they treat my group like dirt\nTheir whole fuckin' family is wearin' our T-shirts\nSo I'mma run 'til I can't run no more\n'Cause it's time for MC Ren to settle the score\nI got a urge to kick down doors\nAt my grave like a slave even if the Ren calls\n\nClouds are dark and brothers are hidin'\nDick-tricklin' at the sunny mutherfucker's are ridin'\nStarted with five and, yo, one couldn't take it\nSo now there's four 'cause the fifth couldn't make it\nThe number's even - now I'm leavin'\nWe're never gettin' took by a bitch with a weave in\nHer and the troops are right behind me\nBut they're so fuckin' stupid, they'll never find me\n\nOne more mile to go through the dark streets\nRunnin' like a mutherfucker on my own two feet\nBut you know I never stumble or lag last\nI'm almost home so I better haul ass\nTearin' up everything in sight\nIt's a little crazy mutherfucker dodging the searchlight\nNow that chase, the shit, is done and\nFour mutherfuckers goin' crazy with\nA 100 miles of runnin'!\nStop! Stop! Stop! Stop!

man, hurry up\nYou don't really think you're gonna get away, do you?\nWe haven't spotted them yet. But they're somewhere in the immediate vicinity\n\nA 100 miles and runnin' -  MC Ren, I hold the gun and\nYou want me to kill a mutherfucker and it's done in\nSince I'm stereotyped to kill and destruct -\nIs one of the main reasons I don't give a fuck\nChances are usually not good\n'Cause I'm frisked with my hands on a hot hood\nAnd gettin' jacked by the you-know-who\nWhen in a black and white the capacity is two\nWe're not alone, we're three more brothers, I mean street-brothers\nNot wearing medallions, 'cause we're not stupid, mutherfuckers\nThey're out to take our heads for what we said in the past\nPoint blank, they can kiss my black ass\nI didn't stutter when I said \"Fuck Tha Police\"\n'Cause it's hard for a nigga to get peace\nNow it's broken and can't be fixed\n'Cause police and little black niggas don't mix so\nNow I'm creepin' through the fall\nRunnin' like a G, we'll see, I might have slayed y'all\nSo for now pack the gun and\nHold it in the air 'cause MC Ren has a 100 miles of runnin'\n\nInto this news. Four fugitives are on the run\nFBI sources tell us that the four are headed\n100 miles to their homebase, Compton\n\nLend me a mutherfuckin' ear\nSo I can tell you why\n\nRunnin' with my brothers, headed for the homebase\nWith a steady pace on the face that just reads race\nThe road ahead goes on and on\nThe shit is gettin' longer than the mutherfuckin' marathon\nRunnin' on but never runnin' out\nStayin' wired and if I get tired, I can still try out\nHitchhikin' if that's what it gotta do\nBut nobody's pickin' up a Nigga Witta Attitude\nConfused, yo but Dre's a nigga with nuthin' to lose\nOne of the few who's been accused and abused\nOf the crime of poisonin' young minds\nBut you don't know shit til you been in my shoes\nAnd Dre is back from the C-P-T\nDroppin' some shit that's D-O-P-E\nSo fuck the P-O-L-I-C-E!\nAnd any mutherfucker that disagrees\nStuck and runnin' hard, hauling ass\n'Cause I been a nigga known for havin' a notorious past\nMy mind was slick - my temper was too quick\nNow the FBI's all over my dick\n\nGot the stick and runnin' just to find the gun that started the clock\nThat's when the E jumped off the startin' block\nA 100 miles from home and, yo, it's a long stretch\nA little sprintin' mutherfucker that they won't catch\nYeah, back to Compton again\nYo, it's either that or the Federal pen\n'Cause niggas been runnin' since beginning of time\nTakin' a minute to tell you what's on my mutherfuckin' mind\nRunnin' like I just don't care\nCompton's 50 miles but, yo, I'mma get there\nArchin' my back and on a straight route\nJust like Carl Lewis I'm ballin' the fuck out\nFrom city to city I'm a menace as I pass by\nRippin' up shit just so you can remember I'm\nA straight up nigga that's done in, gunnin' and comin'\nStraight at yo ass, a 100 miles and runnin'\n\nThis one goes out to the four brothers from Compton\nYou're almost there, but the FBI has a little message for you:\nNowhere to run to, baby. Nowhere to hide\nGood luck brothers\n\nRunnin' like a nigga I hate to lose\nShow me on the news but I hate to be abused\nI know it was a set-up - So now I'm gonna get up\nEven if the FBI wants me to shut up\nBut I've got 10 000 niggas strong\nThey got everybody singin' my \"Fuck Tha Police\" song\nAnd while they treat my group like dirt\nTheir whole fuckin' family is wearin' our T-shirts\nSo I'mma run 'til I can't run no more\n'Cause it's time for MC Ren to settle the score\nI got a urge to kick down doors\nAt my grave like a slave even if the Ren calls\n\nClouds are dark and brothers are hidin'\nDick-tricklin' at the sunny mutherfucker's are ridin'\nStarted with five and, yo, one couldn't take it\nSo now there's four 'cause the fifth couldn't make it\nThe number's even - now I'm leavin'\nWe're never gettin' took by a bitch with a weave in\nHer and the troops are right behind me\nBut they're so fuckin' stupid, they'll never find me\n\nOne more mile to go through the dark streets\nRunnin' like a mutherfucker on my own two feet\nBut you know I never stumble or lag last\nI'm almost home so I better haul ass\nTearin' up everything in sight\nIt's a little crazy mutherfucker dodging the searchlight\nNow that chase, the shit, is done and\nFour mutherfuckers goin' crazy with\nA 100 miles of runnin'!\nStop!

I finna kick this shit, alright! (Alright, then bust it!)\n\nRhymes created by the Doc, most definitely down!\nI could be bitten by this brother with some bad ass brown\nIt ain't no joke, he needs some scope\nCause his breath is (cold!) dope\nAs he talks I can smell it, and I'm seeing the smoke\nThat's the bad breath bandit, you know what's in store\nStay away cause they breath will knock you (to the floor!)\nThat boy is (rough!) de soda (tough!) I don't understand\nTests his breath inside his palm, and burned his hand!\nHe's a tucks destroyer, a Listerine killer\nA cavity employer, a yuck-mouth filler\n(Say man, you bullshit!) no, that's a fact Fresh K\nI wish Velamints could take his breath away\nBut he's.. always in effect, smelling like dead vermin\nHonking the bitches with his firewalls burning\nWinch his witch as a curl, just as funky as well\nI mean he has a little woman that can match his smell (Yes!)\nHe has a girlfriend, this is not pretend\nShe uses deodorant that's made for men\n(Scratch and sniff wallpaper all over the house)\nAww shit!

ass\nI, was...raised in L.A\nI, was...cruising down the street in my six-four\nToo much posse\n\nRiding on Slausson, looking for Crenshaw\nTurned down the sound, to ditch the law\nStopped at a light and  had a fit\nCause a Mexican almost wrecked my s**t\nFlipped his ass off put it to the floor\nBottle was empty so I went to the store\nNigga on tip cause I was drunk\nSee a sissy ass punk, had to go in my trunk\nReached inside cause it's like that\nCame back out with a silver gat\nFired at the punk and it was all because\nI had to show the nigga what time it was\nPulled out the jammy and like a mirage\nA sissy like that got out of Dodge\nSucka on me cause the title I'm holding\nEazy-E's f**ked up and got the 8 Ball rolling\nFuckin' up yo\nFuckin' up yo\nFuckin' up yo\nFuckin' up

dissed your hoe\nAsked her to dance and she said, hell no\nCalled her a b***h because that's the rule\nBoyz-n-the hood trying to keep me cool\nTell my homeboy you wanna kick my butt\nI walked in your face and we get em up\nI started dodging the dogs, and watch you fold\nJust dumb full of cumn got knocked out cold\n\"Make you look sick you snotty nosed prick!\nNow your fly b***hes all over his

a fit\nCause a Mexican almost wrecked my shit\nFlipped his ass off, put it to the floor\nBottle was empty so I went to the store\nNigga on tilt cause I was drunk\nSee a sissy-ass punk, had to go in my trunk\nReached inside cause it's like that\nCame back out with a silver gat\nFired at the punk, and it was all because\nI had to show the nigga what time it was\nPulled out the jammy and like a mirage\nA sissy like that got out of Dodge\nSucka on me cause the title I'm holdin\nEazy-E's fucked up and got the 8 ball rollin\n\"Fuck it up y'all!\" -] repeat 6X\n{\"YEAH!!!\", *guitar riff* -] Beastie Boys}\n\nOlde English 800 cause that's my brand\nTake it in a bottle, 40, quart, or can\nDrink it like a madman, yes I do\nFuck the police and a 502\nStepped in the party, I was drunk as hell\nThree bitches already said, \"Eric yo' breath smells!\"\n40 ounce in hand, that's what I got\n\"Yo man you see Eazy hurling in the parkin lot?\"\nStepped on your foot, cold dissed yo' ho\nAsked her to dance and she said\n\"Hell no!\"\nCalled her a bitch cause that's the rule\n\"Bitch, who you callin a bitch?!\"\nBoys in the hood tryin to keep me cool\nYou tell my homeboy you wanna kick my butt\nI walked in your face and we get 'em up\nI start droppin the dogs, and watch you fold\nJust dumb full of cum, got knocked out cold\n\"Made you look sick you snotty-nosed prick!\nNow your fly bitch is all over his\nDick!\"\nPunk got dropped cause the title I'm holdin\nEazy-E's fucked up and got the 8 ball rollin\n\"Stomp a mudhole in your ass!\" -] Flavor Flav\n\"Stomp a mudhole in your ass, BITCH!\" -] Flav\n\nPass the brew motherfucker while I tear shit up\nAnd y'all listen up close to roll call\nEazy-E's in the place I got money and juice\nRendezvous with me and we make the deuce\nDre makes the beats so god damn funky\nDo the Olde 8, fuck the brass monkey\nIce Cube writes the rhymes, that I say\nHail to the niggas from C.I.A\nKrazy D is down and in effect\nWe make hardcore jams, so fuck respect\nMake a toast punky-punk to the title I'm holdin\nEazy-E's fucked up and got the 8 ball rollin\n{*scratched*} \"City of Compton!\"\n{*scratched*} \"City of Compton!\" {*echoes*}\n{*scratched*} \"City of Compton!\" {*scratched to end*}", "image": "https://images.genius.com/0ec6f769fde231f68fadfff699d2b94c.1000x1000x1.jpg", "artist": "N.W.A", "raw":

that\nCame back out with a silver gat\nFired at the punk, and it was all because\nI had to show the nigga what time it was\nPulled out the jammy and like a mirage\nA sissy like that got out of

gonna do, Dre? - Kick it!\n\nAnd so on, let the shit flow on\nBecause I need somethin' to go off on\nThe mothafuckin' D-R-E servin' a death wish\nSo I'mma hit you like this\nEarly in the morning, hop into the B-en-z\nI got 44 ways of gettin' paid\nSittin' in my lap as I roll off the Compton blocks\nTo scoop up Ren, I heard shots\n1, 2, 3, then I seen a nigga\nHoppin' the fence and it was Ren on the mothafuckin' trigger\nHe got in the Benz and said\n\"Dre, I was speakin' to yo' bitch O'Shea\u201d\nAnd as we roll on, I seen the patroller creep\nSo we got ghost before they peeped\nMe and Ren in a black CE, yo\nBumpin' some funky shit by the D.O.C\nI gotta get paid, paid in a hurry, see\nI got a habit if I'm not paid thoroughly\nI start takin', makin' sure my shit is steady bumpin'\nA nigga always into somethin'\n\nBa-ba-ba-ba!

negativity\nNeed to come kick it in the city with me\nAnd find the black and crack de fact\nAnd take that shit back\n'Cause they don't wanna fuck with that\nThere's too many niggas they're tryin' to calm\nIf mothafuckaz could get it, nobody would've fuck with it\nAppetite for destruction\nFor him to get a bit more shit he gotta commit\nMurder in the first degree and manslaughter\nTakin' the life of his wife and young daughter\nA whole city of bitches that look sucked up\nAnd the niggas is killin', it's straight fucked up\nWhoever sayin' what I'm sayin is for greed\nThen I ain't even what they're tryin' to feed\nMy appetite for destruction\n\"You guys know who I'm talkin' to\"\n\nThe appetite is tremendous, so I'm gonna spin this\nDrop up some violence because they ask me to end this\nSome trouble that I cought 'cause I was noisy\nA nigga tried to take advantage because of the kamikaze\nHe took a swing for my head, thought I was faded\nStart runnin' for the door but the fucker never made it\nThe sound of the 9 went bang\nAnd all over the wall was his mothafuckin' brain\n'Cause I'm a nigga you can't sleep on\nSo set the alarm, 'cause I hit like a mothafuckin' bomb\nI do damage with the 9 in my hand\nBut the average nigga that don\u2019t know me don\u2019t understand\nI'm from the streets, so therefore\nYou know I don't care for a sucker that ain't down\nWith the real niggas, the niggas, the niggas\nYo, and after when the shit gotta go ain't even sober\nAny time that the 9 wanna leave\nI got a .38 hidden up the sleeve\nAnd it's ready to go to war 'cause that's what it's here for\nI shoot down a million niggas and shoot one more\nAnd that's the million and one, they couldn't hang with the appetite, 'cause they wasn't rappin' right\nSo I had to destroy whoever was standin' in my presence\nFor fuckin' up the essence \u2013 appetite for destruction\n\n\"Cops put a hurtin' on yo' ass, man\nYou know, they really degrade you\nWhite folks don't believe that shit\nThey don't believe that cops degrade you\n Oh come on, those people, those people are resisting arrest.\"\n\nCheck it out, y'all, in the house, y'all\nSo I can show and flow and let the

the E\nBy the time you get to seven, you'll be six feet deep\nNumber eight \u2013 make no mistake\nMove real sneaky and you're bound to catch your prey\nNinth one \u2013 I gotta be raw\nFuck any

"I got a taste for waste and a taste and a blood\nMurder I heard her when she screamed the \"Drop!\"\n'Cause her son caught the slug\nRelate this to no choice\nAnd listen to this straight-up man before they ban the voice\nWhile I rhyme to the rhythm of a pop\nRemember the first nigga that runs is the first to get shot\nWhoever said that what I say and portray is negativity\nNeed to come kick it in the city with me\nAnd find the black and crack de fact\nAnd take that shit back\n'Cause they don't wanna fuck with that\nThere's too many niggas they're tryin' to calm\nIf mothafuckaz could get it, nobody would've fuck with it\nAppetite for destruction\nFor him to get a bit more shit he gotta commit\nMurder in the first degree and manslaughter\nTakin' the life of his wife and young daughter\nA whole city of bitches that look sucked up\nAnd the niggas is killin', it's straight fucked up\nWhoever sayin' what I'm sayin is for greed\nThen I ain't even what they're tryin' to feed\nMy appetite for destruction\n\"You guys know who I'm talkin' to\"\n\nThe appetite is tremendous, so I'm gonna spin this\nDrop up some violence because they ask me to end this\nSome trouble that I cought 'cause I was noisy\nA nigga tried to take advantage because of the kamikaze\nHe took a swing for my head, thought I was faded\nStart runnin' for the door but the fucker never made it\nThe sound of the 9 went bang\nAnd all over the wall was his mothafuckin' brain\n'Cause I'm a nigga you can't sleep on\nSo set the alarm, 'cause I hit like a mothafuckin' bomb\nI do damage with the 9 in my hand\nBut the average nigga that don\u2019t know me don\u2019t understand\nI'm from the streets, so therefore\nYou know I don't care for a sucker that ain't down\nWith the real niggas, the niggas, the niggas\nYo, and after when the shit gotta go ain't even sober\nAny time that the 9 wanna leave\nI got a .38 hidden up the sleeve\nAnd it's ready to go to war 'cause that's what it's here for\nI shoot down a million niggas and shoot one more\nAnd that's the million and one, they couldn't hang with the appetite, 'cause they wasn't rappin' right\nSo I had to destroy whoever was standin' in my presence\nFor fuckin' up the essence \u2013 appetite for destruction\n\n\"Cops put a hurtin' on yo' ass, man\nYou know, they really degrade you\nWhite folks don't believe that shit\nThey don't believe that cops degrade you\n Oh come on, those people, those people are resisting arrest.\"\n\nCheck it out, y'all, in the house, y'all\nSo I can show and flow and let the people know\nSo won't you ease on down to the yellow brick road\nTo Compton, but first let me tell you somethin'\nI possess the 10 commandments of the hip-hop thugsta\nKnown as the thief and murderer\nFirst one \u2013 honor thy nigga with an attitude\nGotta get respect or break your mothafuckin' neck\nSecond one \u2013 always gotta fuck out of wedlock\nI like it when the pussy goes snap, crackle and pop\nNumber three \u2013 I'm a gangsta fanatic\nI smoke any fools tryna 'cause some static\nNumber four \u2013 here's what's in store\nA crazy-ass nigga that remains hardcore\nFifth one \u2013 my kill has just begun\nI pull out my gun, that'll keep me on the run\nStep six \u2013 hmmm, it's kinda tricky\nCan't forget that I'm mothafuckin' chicken-shit\nTo the ones who tries to play the E\nBy the time you get to seven, you'll be six feet deep\nNumber eight \u2013 make no mistake\nMove real sneaky and you're bound to catch your prey\nNinth one \u2013 I gotta be raw\nFuck any brainwashin' man-made law!\nLast but not least, I must be real\nNumber ten \u2013 is my appetite to ki\u2013"}}, {"title": "Approach to Danger", "album": "Niggaz4Life", "year": "1991-05-28", "lyrics": "What you want, is an unexpected approach\nThat may delay a suspect's awareness, of your presence\nUntil you have a chance to assess\nThe situation, you are confronted\nApproach to danger... don't move\n(It's hard to predict what would happen next)\n(Oh shit, he has a gun!) Drop the gun\nYou could've prevented a tragedy\n\nYou can approach, but the danger light is blinkin\nA self-desctruct button is activated when I'm thinkin\nThis is a tribulation, the weak is judged\nThe prophecy was fulfilled, cause I never budge\nI took up the tools, crucifixion was the extreme\nThey're seein doubles of me, but it wasn't a dream\nOne vision was of life, the other was death\nAnd life didn't give a fuck if death took your last breath\nSo you burn in my pit that I call hell\nWhere you got sent, because your shit don't sell\nMy twenty-twenty was blurry from the smoke\nOf the niggas that I burned and tormented but I didn't choke\nI started doing them, I kept on doing them, two of them\nShoot them up until that nigga Ren was through with them\nAnd my presence to the suckers was of a stranger\nBut fuck it, they can approach to the danger\n\nIf you can be seen, you can be hit\nIf you can be hit, you can be killed\n(He's over there! Shoot him!)\n\nFatal approach to danger, just to remain a strangler\nOut run, the shot of a gun when the game's up\nMurder in the first degree, but it's worse to be\nA dead motherfucker or a nigga in custody\nWith everybody thinkin of death\nI kept workin, to be one of the last niggas left\nSo many people lookin for hope, they broke\nWithout checkin the fingerprints on a motherfucker's throat\nA heart of steel can reveal the real nigga in me\nSo figure to see, the D-E-A-D\nBodies like a nigga straight walkin in a cemetary\nSo it's very necessary to carry\nAmmunition for niggas wishin but they better take caution\nBefore Dre goes off\nAnd starts killin motherfuckers just in order to change the\nAnger for the real nigga when I approach to danger\n\nApproach the motherfuckin danger\n(\"Come back to hell and see me some time!\")\n(\"This is it y'all\")\n\nFinal approach to danger, death, destruction around every corner\nAnother dead body and you wanna keep runnin\nBut even the rain turns black\nAll you can do is stay alert and try to stay out of the searchlight\nNo prison, nobody makes bail\nEverybody gotta go but see it ain't no jail\nThink about death, takin your last breath\nHeart beatin like a motherfucker like it ain't no time left\nWith so many ways to stay up, I gotta get mine\nEven though they wanna make a crime, yo\nOf bein real, a federal letter in the beginnin\nBecause of the release of \"Fuck the Police\"\nFuck it I approach the danger\nCause I don't give a fuck if somebody gotta get fucked up\nSo you might as well kiss your ass goodbye\nCause in the long run (\"we all die\")", "image": "https://images.genius.com/378262f83025b434fc5375a332bd1a1f.800x800x1.png", "artist": "N.W.A", "raw": {"annotation_count": 13, "api_path": "/songs/35686", "description": {"dom":

"What you want, is an unexpected approach\nThat may delay a suspect's awareness, of your presence\nUntil you have a chance to assess\nThe situation, you are confronted\nApproach to danger... don't move\n(It's hard to predict what would happen next)\n(Oh shit, he has a gun!) Drop the gun\nYou could've prevented a tragedy\n\nYou can approach, but the danger light is blinkin\nA self-desctruct button is activated when I'm thinkin\nThis is a tribulation, the weak is judged\nThe prophecy was fulfilled, cause I never budge\nI took up the tools, crucifixion was the extreme\nThey're seein doubles of me, but it wasn't a dream\nOne vision was of life, the other was death\nAnd life didn't give a fuck if death took your last breath\nSo you burn in my pit that I call hell\nWhere you got sent, because your shit don't sell\nMy twenty-twenty was blurry from the smoke\nOf the niggas that I burned and tormented but I didn't choke\nI started doing them, I kept on doing them, two of them\nShoot them up until that nigga Ren was through with them\nAnd my presence to the suckers was of a stranger\nBut fuck it, they can approach to the danger\n\nIf you can be seen, you can be hit\nIf you can be hit, you can be killed\n(He's over there! Shoot him!)\n\nFatal approach to danger, just to remain a strangler\nOut run, the shot of a gun when the game's up\nMurder in the first degree, but it's worse to be\nA dead motherfucker or a nigga in custody\nWith everybody thinkin of death\nI kept workin, to be one of the last niggas left\nSo many people lookin for hope, they broke\nWithout checkin the fingerprints on a motherfucker's throat\nA heart of steel can reveal the real nigga in me\nSo figure to see, the D-E-A-D\nBodies like a nigga straight walkin in a cemetary\nSo it's very necessary to carry\nAmmunition for niggas wishin but they better take caution\nBefore Dre goes off\nAnd starts killin motherfuckers just in order to change the\nAnger for the real nigga when I approach to danger\n\nApproach the motherfuckin danger\n(\"Come back to hell and see me some time!\")\n(\"This is it y'all\")\n\nFinal approach to danger, death, destruction around every corner\nAnother dead body and you wanna keep runnin\nBut even the rain turns black\nAll you can do is stay alert and try to stay out of the searchlight\nNo prison, nobody makes bail\nEverybody gotta go but see it ain't no jail\nThink about death, takin your last breath\nHeart beatin like a motherfucker like it ain't no time left\nWith so many ways to stay up, I gotta get mine\nEven though they wanna make a crime, yo\nOf bein real, a federal letter in the beginnin\nBecause of the release of \"Fuck the Police\"\nFuck it I approach the danger\nCause I don't give a fuck if somebody gotta get fucked up\nSo you might as well kiss your ass goodbye\nCause in the long run (\"we

situation you are confronted\nApproach to danger, don't move\nIt's hard to predict what would happen next\nOh s***, he has a gun, drop the gun\nYou could've prevented a tragedy\nYou can approach but the danger light is blinkin'\nA self-destruct button is activated when I'm thinkin'\nThis is a tribulation, the weak is judged\nThe prophecy was fulfilled 'cause I never budge\nI took up the tools, crucifixion was the extreme\nThey're seein' doubles of me, but it wasn't a dream\nOne vision was of life, the other was death\nAnd life didn't give a *** if death took your last breath\nSo you burn in my pit that I call 'Hell'\nWhere you got sent because your *** don't sell\nMy 20/20 was blurry from the smoke\nOf the *** that I burned and tormented but I didn't choke\nI started doin' 'em, I kept on doin' 'em\nTwo of 'em, shoot 'em up 'til that *** Ren was through with 'em\nAnd my presence to the suckers was of a stranger\nBut *** it, they can approach to the danger\nIf you can be seen, you can be hit\nIf you can be hit, you can be killed\nHe's on the line, shoot him\nFatal approach to danger, just to remain a strangler\nOut run the shot of a gun when the game's up\nMurder in the first degree but it's worse to be\nA dead motherf*** or a *** in custody\nWith everybody thinkin' of death\nI kept workin' to be one of the last n*** left\nSo many people lookin' for hope, they broke\nWithout checkin' the fingerprints on a motherf*** throat\nA heart of steel can reveal the real *** in me\nSo figure to see the D E A D\nBodies like a *** straight walkin' in a cemetery\nSo it's very necessary to carry\nAmmunition for *** wishin' but they better take caution\nBefore Dre goes off\nAnd starts killin' motherf*** just in order to change the\nAnger for the real *** when I approach to danger\nApproach the motherf*** danger\nCome back to hell and see me some time\nThis is it, y'all\nFinal approach to danger, death, destruction around every corner\nAnother dead body and you wanna keep runnin'\nBut even the day turns black\nAll you can do is stay alert and try to stay out of the searchlight\nNo prison, nobody makes bail\nEverybody gotta go but see it ain't no jail\nThink about death, takin' your last breath\nHeart beatin' like a motherf***, like it ain't no time left\nWith so many ways to stay up, I gotta get mine\nEven though they wanna make a crime, yo\nOf bein' real, a federal letter in the beginnin'\nBecause of the release of 'F*** Tha Police'\n*** it I approach the danger\n'Cause I don't give a *** if somebody gotta get *** up\nSo you might as well kiss your ass goodbye\n'Cause in the long run, we all die"}}, {"title": "Arrested", "album": null, "year": null, "lyrics": "Police:Ok niggas you got one call\nEasy-E:ain't that a bitch you fat mother f**ker let me

\"Don't\"\nI said biiiiiitch\n\nYou don't have to front on me dear\nSo why don't you just give that pussy here?\nIf you'd be good to me\nOhh I'll be good to you\nAnd we'll both ride home in my automobile\n\nAll that I want is a little puss'\nAll that I want is just a little head\nIf you'd be good to me\nOhh I'll be good to you\nAnd we'll both ride home in my automobile\n\nYou don't have to front on me bitch\nDon't be afraid - it's only a dick\nGive up the pussy soon\nAll I want is a little womb\nOr get your groupie ass out my hotel room\nOr get your groupie ass out my hotel room\n\nAll I want is the pussy\nAll I want is the pussy\nAll I want is the pussy\nAll I want is the pussy\nIf you'd be good to me\nOhh I'll be good to you\nAnd we'll both ride home in my automobile\nWe'll both

down the street in my 6-4\nJockin' the bitches, slappin' the hoes\nWent to the park to get the scoop\nKnuckleheads out there cold shootin' some hoops\nA car pulls up, who can it be?\nA fresh El Camino rollin' Kilo G\nHe rolls down his window and he started to say\nIt's all about makin' that GTA\n'Coz the boyz-n-the-hood are always hard\nYou come talkin' that trash, we'll pull your card\nKnowin' nothin' in life but to be legit\nDon't quote me, boy 'coz I ain't sayin' shit\nDonald B in the place to give me the pace\nHe said, My man JD is on freebase\nThe boy JD was a friend of mine\n'Til I caught him in my car tryin' to steal my Alpine\nChased him up the street to call a truce\nThe silly cluck head pulls out a deuce-deuce\nLittle did he know I had a loaded 12 gauge\nOne sucker dead, L.A. Times, front page\n'Coz the boyz-n-the-hood are always hard\nYou come talkin' that trash, we'll pull your card\nKnowin' nothin' in life but to be legit\nDon't quote me, boy 'coz I ain't sayin' shit\nBored as hell and I wanna get ill\nSo I went to a place where my homeboys chill\nThe fellows out there, makin' that dollar\nI pulled up in my 6-4 Impala\nThey greet me with a 40 and I started drinkin'\nAnd from the 8-ball, my breath start stinkin'\nLove to get my girl, to rock that body\nBefore I left, I hit the Bacardi\nWent to her house to get her out of the pad\nDumb h*** says somethin' that made me mad\nShe said somethin' that I couldn't believe\nSo I grabbed the stupid *** by her nappy ass weave\nShe started talkin *** wouldn't you know?\nReached back like a pimp and slapped the h***\nHer father jumped out and he started to shout\nSo I threw a right-cross, cold knocked him out\n'Coz the boyz-n-the-hood are always hard\nYou come talkin' that trash, we'll pull your card\nKnowin' nothin' in life but to be legit\nDon't quote me, boy 'coz I ain't sayin' ***\nI'm rollin' hard now, I'm under control\nThen wrapped my 6-4 'round the telephone poll\nI looked at my car and I said, \"Oh brother\nI throw it in the gutter and go buy another\nWalkin' home, I see the G ride\nNow Kat is drivin', Kilo on the side\nAs they busted a u, they got pulled over\nAn undercover cop in a dark green Nova\nKat got beaten for resistin' arrest\nHe socked the pig in the head for rippin' his Guess\nNow G is caught for doin' the crime\nFourth offense on the boy, he'll do some time\n'Coz

there was no bail\nThe fellaz start to riot in the County Jail\nTwo days later in Municipal Court\nKilo G on trial, cold cut a fart\nDisruption of a court said the judge\nOn a six-year sentence, my man didn't budge\nBailiff came over to turn him in\nKilo G looked up and gave a grin\nHe yelled out fire, then came Suzy\nThe *** came in with a sub-machine Uzi\nPolice shot the girl but didn't hurt her\nBoth up state for attempted murder\n'Coz the boyz-n-the-hood are always hard\nYou come talkin' that trash, we'll pull your card\nKnowin' nothin' in life but to be legit\nDon't quote me, boy 'coz

effect\nHey yo yella boy, kick me that funky-ass beat\nYeah, who's in de mothafuckin' house?\nCompton's in the mothafuckin' house!\nYeah, Compton's definetly in the house\nHey yo Ren, what we're gonna do?\n\nTo the people over here\nTo the people over there\nTo the people, the people, the people, people, the people, the people\nPeople From everywhere watching the show\nPaying top dolars because they know\nWhen we're on the stage, we're in a mothafuckin' range\nSo Dre, why don't you get the 12 guage \nAnd show 'em how Eazy-Duz-It\nSo if you punks wanna make somethin' of it\nStep up, run up, get up, what's up sucker\nYou want some of this?\nThen you're a stupid mothafucka!\nKickin' - like the kick from a kickdrum\nYella boy on the drum gettin' dumb\nProgrammin' - a beat that's hittin'\nAnd if you listen then you know we're not bullshittin'\nDope - like a pound or a key\nSo shut de fuck up and listen to me\nI make a killin\nI got money to the ceiling \n'cause I'm a mothafuckin' ruthless villain\nMC Ren - stomping any fool in my way\nWith some help from my homeboy Dre\n\nNow my name iz Dre - de mothafuckin' doctor\nRippin' shit up  and here to rock ya\nWith some help from my homeboy E\nThe criminal of the ruthless posse\nFuckin' it up  iz what we do\nThe reputation of the NWA crew\nGettin' busy because we're cold stampin'\nAnd we're born and raised\nAnd we're born and raised\nAnd we're born and raised in Compton\nSpeakin' of Compton, it's makin' me sick \nEverybody'z talkin' that crazy shit\nSayin' they were raised in the CPT \nJust as I was, they try to be like me\nPoppin' that shit, get the fuck out my face\nKnowin' that they never even seen the place\nClaimin' my city is my city they claim\nMothafuckaz we're about to put some salt in your game ..\nYeah I'm tired of these mothafuckerz runnin' around town, talkin' about\nThey're from Compton and shit, tryin' to get on the bandwagon ..\nYeah Dre, I know what you're sayin' man, but let's tell 'em who we're\nTalkin' about ..\nWHAT DO YOU CALL A CREW THAT CAN RAP LIKE THAT ...?\nYo NWA call 'em mothafuckaz wack..\n\nThey got a wacky wack record wit a wacky wack crew\nYo what about the lyrics?\nThat shit's wacky wack too\nWith a fucked up style and a fucked up show\nHey yo Ren, what about the scratchin', is it def?\nFuck no!\nThe mothafuckin' record is so mothafuckin' wack\nThe mothafuckin' cracka jack needs to step the fuck back ...\nDo you want some of this?\nHell no ..\nDre the mothafuckin' doctor\nWell for the record it's Ren and for the street it's Villain\nDre the mothafuckin' doctor\nWell for the record it's Ren and for the street it's Villain\nYella boy, why don't you kick me one of them funky-ass beats?\nMy boy .. my boy .. my boy Ice Cube\nYo we got my homeboy Eazy E in de house\nWon't you tell 'em what your name iz?\n\nMC Ren is the mothafuckin' Coroner\nI'm gettin' rid of mothafuckaz as if they was a foreigner\nShow no greed to pretend when I sin\nI punch you can block it but I'm a still get in\nThis ain't a TKO in the first\nBut it's some shit from a nigga in black it's much worse\nThen a beat from Tyson 'cause Ren is not nice and\nYour ass is better off just rollin' a dice and\nFindin' you a number for luck\n'cause you all need it when you see I don't give a fuck\nMy identity, and the shit is gettin' shown\nWithout a video I'm still gettin' on\nI'm at a show then my picture is takin'\nOne click of the flash and punk niggas are breakin'\nTo the door, tryin' to join my fan club\nLipstickin' over one of my dubs\nAnd it's the minimal scratch for the moment\nUntil I fuck up the so called opponet\nThat's standing in the zone of the twilight\nSayin' how in de fuck did he get mixed up in my fight\nIt was'nt a mistake, it was a set-up\nSo until I'm finished poppin' my lyrics you should shut up\nAnd don't attempt to speak\nBecause it's bad enough you rollin' up shit quick\nWith a nigga like Ren about the hit\nNow lemme hear you mothafuckaz talk some more shit\nI'm a bust your ass in your mouth\nYo, unless you're sayin' \"Compton's in de house\"\n\nWho realy cares - about a sucker on a take off\nBust de move, we can have a shake n' bake-off\nMe and you can go 'cause I don't care yo\nRap fight or guerilla warfare\nWe can rumble, 'cause when my lungs go in and out\nI kick rhymes in a bundle to win about\nOr scarier scaffle\nI just muffle the opposition, there's no competition\nLet 'em know that Dre is gettin' stronger\nCompton's in de house but now it's some' longer\nI won't get set-up, shut up, I'm kinda fed up\nYou can say uncle and I still won't let up\n'cause Dre is the mothafuckin' doctor\nAnd if me and Ren's on the mike it's like propaganda, no doubt\n\"Boy you should've known by now\" ..\nCompton's in the house\nYeah, it's time to put Compton on de map, don't ever think you can get it on\nYou stupid mothafuckaz!\nCompton's in the house ..", "image":

the people, the people, the people, people, the people, the people\nPeople From everywhere watching the show\nPaying top dolars because they know\nWhen we're on the stage, we're in a mothafuckin'

a stupid mothafucka!\nKickin' - like the kick from a kickdrum\nYella boy on the drum gettin' dumb\nProgrammin' - a beat that's hittin'\nAnd if you listen then you know we're not bullshittin'\nDope - like a pound or a key\nSo shut de fuck up and listen to me\nI make a killin\nI got money to the ceiling \n'cause I'm a mothafuckin' ruthless villain\nMC Ren - stomping any fool in my way\nWith some help from my homeboy Dre\n\nNow my name iz Dre - de mothafuckin' doctor\nRippin' shit up  and here to rock ya\nWith some help from my homeboy E\nThe criminal of the ruthless posse\nFuckin' it up  iz what we do\nThe reputation of the NWA crew\nGettin' busy because we're cold stampin'\nAnd we're born and raised\nAnd we're born and raised\nAnd we're born and raised in Compton\nSpeakin' of Compton, it's makin' me sick \nEverybody'z talkin' that crazy shit\nSayin' they were raised in the CPT \nJust as I was, they try to be like me\nPoppin' that shit, get the fuck out my face\nKnowin' that they never even seen the place\nClaimin' my city is my city they claim\nMothafuckaz we're about to put some salt in your game ..\nYeah I'm tired of these mothafuckerz runnin' around town, talkin' about\nThey're from Compton and shit, tryin' to get on the bandwagon ..\nYeah Dre, I know what you're sayin' man, but let's tell 'em who we're\nTalkin' about ..\nWHAT DO YOU CALL A CREW THAT CAN RAP LIKE THAT ...?\nYo NWA call 'em mothafuckaz wack..\n\nThey got a wacky wack record wit a wacky wack crew\nYo what about the lyrics?\nThat shit's wacky wack too\nWith a fucked up style and a fucked up show\nHey yo Ren, what about the scratchin', is it def?\nFuck no!\nThe mothafuckin' record is so mothafuckin' wack\nThe mothafuckin' cracka jack needs to step the fuck back ...\nDo you want some of this?\nHell no ..\nDre the mothafuckin' doctor\nWell for the record it's Ren and for the street it's Villain\nDre the mothafuckin' doctor\nWell for the record it's Ren and for the street it's Villain\nYella boy, why don't you kick me one of them funky-ass beats?\nMy boy .. my boy .. my boy Ice Cube\nYo we got my homeboy Eazy E in de house\nWon't you tell 'em what your name iz?\n\nMC Ren is the mothafuckin' Coroner\nI'm gettin' rid of mothafuckaz as if they was a foreigner\nShow no greed to pretend when I sin\nI punch you can block it but I'm a still get in\nThis ain't a TKO in the first\nBut it's some shit from a nigga in black it's much worse\nThen a beat from Tyson 'cause Ren is not nice and\nYour ass is better off just rollin' a dice and\nFindin' you a number for luck\n'cause you all need it when you see I don't give a fuck\nMy identity, and the shit is gettin' shown\nWithout a video I'm still gettin' on\nI'm at a show then my picture is takin'\nOne click of the flash and punk niggas are breakin'\nTo the door, tryin' to join my fan club\nLipstickin' over one of my dubs\nAnd it's the minimal scratch for the moment\nUntil I fuck up the so called opponet\nThat's standing in the zone of the twilight\nSayin' how in de fuck did he get mixed up in my fight\nIt was'nt a mistake, it was a set-up\nSo until I'm finished poppin' my lyrics you should shut up\nAnd don't attempt to speak\nBecause it's bad enough you rollin' up shit quick\nWith a nigga like Ren about the hit\nNow lemme hear you mothafuckaz talk some more shit\nI'm a bust your ass in your mouth\nYo, unless you're sayin' \"Compton's in de house\"\n\nWho realy cares - about a sucker on a take off\nBust de move, we can have a shake n' bake-off\nMe and you can go 'cause I don't care yo\nRap fight or guerilla warfare\nWe can rumble, 'cause when my lungs go in and out\nI kick rhymes in a bundle to win about\nOr scarier scaffle\nI just muffle the opposition, there's no competition\nLet 'em know that Dre is gettin' stronger\nCompton's in de house but now it's some' longer\nI won't get set-up, shut up, I'm kinda fed up\nYou can say uncle and I still won't let up\n'cause Dre is the mothafuckin' doctor\nAnd if me and Ren's on the mike it's like propaganda, no doubt\n\"Boy you should've known by now\" ..\nCompton's in the house\nYeah, it's time to put Compton on de map, don't ever think you can get it on\nYou stupid mothafuckaz!\nCompton's in the house .."}}, {"title": "Compton's N the House (Live Mix)", "album": "N.W.A.

full effect\nHey yo Yella boy, kick me that funky-ass beat\nPump it up, pump it up\nYeah, who's in the mothafucking house right now?\nPump that shit up\nYeah, Compton's definetly in the house\nHey yo Ren, what we're gonna do?\n\nTo the people over here\nTo the people over there\nTo the people, the people, the people, people, the people, the people, people\nFrom everywhere watching the show\nPaying top dolars because they know\nWhen we're on the stage, we're in a mothafuckin' range\n So Dre\n What up?\n Why don't you get the 12 guage\nAnd show 'em how Eazy-Duz-It\nSo if you punks wanna make somethin' of it\nStep up, run up, get up, what's up sucker\nYou want some of this?\nThen you're a stupid mothafucka\nKickin' - like the kick from a kickdrum\nYella boy on the drum gettin' dumb\nProgrammin' - a beat that's hittin'\nAnd if you listen then you know we're not bullshittin'\n\nDope - like a pound or a key\nSo shut the fuck up and listen to me\nI make a killin'\nI got money to the ceilin' (why's that?)\nCuz I'm a mothafuckin' ruthless villain\nMC Ren - stomping any fool in my way\nWith some help from my homeboy Dre\n\nNow my name is Dre - de mothafuckin' doctor\nRippin' shit up, oh yeah, and here to rock ya\nWith some help from my homeboy E\nThe criminal of the ruthless posse\nFuckin' it up, word up, is what we do\nThe reputation of the NWA crew\nGettin' busy because we're cold stompin'\nAnd we're born and raised\nAnd we're born and raised\nAnd we're born and raised in Compton\n\n Speaking of Compton, it's making me sick (why?)\nEverybody's talking that crazy shit\n Saying they were raised in the CPT (aha)\nJust as I was, they try to be like me\n Popping that shit, get the fuck out my face\nKnowing that they never even seen the place\nClaiming my city is my city they claim\nMuthafucka we're about to put some salt in your game\n\nYeah I'm tired of these mothafuckers running around town Talking about they're from Compton and shit\nTrying to get on the bandwagon ..\nYeah Dre, I know what you're saying man\nBut let's tell them who we're talking about\n\nWhat do you call a crew that can rap like that?\n Yo N.W.A call them muthafuckers wack\n Yeah you know what time it is, listen to why we call them wack\nThey got a wacky wack record with a wacky wack crew\n Yo what about the lyrics?\n That shit's wacky wack too\n With a fucked up style and a fucked up show\n Hey yo Ren, what about the scratching, is it def?\n Fuck no!\nThe mothafucking record is so mothafucking wack\nThe mothafucking cracka jack needs to step the fuck back\n\nDo you want some of this? Hell no\nDre the mothafuckin' doctor\nWell for the record it's Ren and for the street it's Villain\nDre the mothafuckin' doctor\nWell for the record it's Ren and for the street it's Villain\nYella boy, why don't you kick me one of them funky-ass beats?\nMy boy, my boy, my boy Ice Cube\nYo we got my homeboy Eazy E in the house\nWon't you tell 'em what your name is?\n\nMC Ren is the mothafucking coroner\nI'm getting rid of mothafuckas as if they was a foreigner\nShow no grief to pretend when I sin\nI punch you can block it but I'm a still get in\nThis ain't a TKO in the first\nBut it's some shit from a nigga in black it's much worse\nThan a beat from Tyson cause Ren is not nice and\nYour ass is better off just rolling a dice and\nFinding you a number for luck\nCause you all need it when you see I don't give a fuck\nMy identity, and the shit is getting shown\nWithout a video I'm still getting on\nI'm at a show then my picture is taken\nOne click of the flash and punk niggas are breakin'\nTo the door, tryin' to join my fan club\nLip-syncin' over one of my dubs\nThe instrumental will scratch for the moment\nUntil I fuck up the so called opponent\nThat's standing in the zone of the twilight\nSaying how in the fuck did he get mixed up in my fight\nIt wasn't a mistake, it was a set-up\nSo until I'm finished poppin' my lyrics you should shut up\nAnd don't attempt to speak\nBecause it's bad enough you rollin' up shit creek\nWith a nigga like Ren about the hit\nNow let me hear you mothafuckas talk some more shit\nI'm a bust your ass in your mouth\nYo, unless you're saying, \"Compton's in the house\"\n\nWho realy cares - about a sucker on a take off\nBust a move, we can have a shake and bake-off\nMe and you can go cause I don't care yo\nRap fight or guerilla warfare\nWe can rumble, cause when my lungs go in and out\nI kick rhymes in a bundle to win a bout\nOr scurry or scuffle\nI just muffle the opposition, there's no competition\nLet them know that Dre is getting stronger\nCompton's in the house but now it's some' longer\nI won't get set-up, shut up, I'm kinda fed up\nYou can say uncle and I still won't let up\nCause Dre is the mothafucking doctor\nAnd if me and Ren's on the mic, it's like propaganda no doubt\nBoy you should've known by now\n\nYeah, it's time to put Compton on the map\nDon't ever think you can get it on, you stupid mothafuckas!"}}, {"title": "Don't Drink That Wine", "album": "Niggaz4Life", "year": "1991-05-28", "lyrics": "Yo!

slangin' 'caine\nGold around his neck in 14 K heaven\nBitches clockin' on his dick twenty-four/seven\nPlus he's makin' money, keep the baseheads waitin'\nRollin' six-fo' wit the fresh ass Daytons\nLivin' in Compton, Cailfornia C-A\nHis uzi up yo' ass if he don't get paid\nNigga beggin' for credit, he's knockin' out teeth\nClockin' much dollars on the 1st and 15th\nBig wad of money nuttin' less than a twenty\nYo you want a five-oh the dopeman's got plenty\nTo be a dopeman boy you must qualify\nDon't get high off your own supply\nFrom a ki' to a G it's all about money\nTen piece for a champ, bass pipe comes free\nIf people out there are not hip to the fact\nIf you see somebody gettin' money for crack\nHe's the\n\nDopeman, dopeman!

(Express yourself)\n\nI'm expressing with my full capabilities\nAnd now I'm living in correctional facilities\nCause some don't agree with how I do this\nI get straight, meditate like a Buddhist\nI'm dropping flavor, my behavior is hereditary\nBut my technique is very necessary\nBlame it on Ice Cube, because he says it gets funky\nWhen you got a subject and a predicate\nAdd it on a dope beat and that'll make you think\nSome suckers just tickle me pink\nTo my stomach, cause they don't flow like this one\nYou know what? I won't hesitate to dis one\nOr two before I'm through, so don't try to sing this\nSome drop science, well I'm dropping English\nEven if Yella makes it a cappella\nI still express, yo I don't smoke weed or sess\nCause it's known to give a brother brain damage\nAnd brain damage on the mic don't manage nothing\nBut making a sucker and you equal, don't be another sequel\n\nExpress yourself\nCome on and do it\n\nNow, getting back to the PG\nThat's program, and it's easy\nDre is back, new jacks are made hollow\nExpressing ain't their subject because they like to follow\nThe words, the style, the trend, the records I spin\nAgain and again and again, yo, you on the other end\nWatch a brother saying dope rhymes with no help\nThere's no fessing and guessing while I'm expressing myself\nIt's crazy to see people be\nWhat society wants them to be, but not me\nRuthless is the way to go, they know\nOthers say rhymes that fail to be original\nOr they kill where the hip-hop starts\nForget about the ghetto and rap for the pop charts\nSome musicians cuss at home\nBut scared to use profanity when up on the microphone\nYeah, they want reality but you won't hear none\nThey rather exaggerate a little fiction\nSome say no to drugs and take a stand\nBut after the show they go looking for the dopeman\nOr they ban my group from the radio, hear N.W.A and say \"Hell no!\"\nBut you know it ain't all about wealth as long as you make a note to...\n\nExpress yourself\nCome on and do it\n\nFrom the heart cause if you wanna start to move up the chart\nThen expression is a big part of it\nYou ain't efficient when you flow\nYou ain't swift, moving like a tortoise, full of rigor mortis\nThere's a little bit more to show\nI got rhymes in my mind, embedded like an embryo\nOr a lesson, all of 'em expression\nAnd if you start fessing, I got a Smith and Wesson for you\nI might ignore your record because it has no bottom\nI get loose in the summer, winter, spring and autumn\nIt's Dre on the mic, getting physical\nDoing the job, N.W.A is the lynch mob\nYes, I'm macabre but you know you need this\nAnd the knowledge is growing, just like a fetus\nOr a tumor but here's the rumor\nDre is in the neighborhood and he's up to no good\nWhen I start expressing myself, Yella slam it\nCause If I stay funky like this, I'm doing damage\nOr I'mma be too hyped and need a straight jacket\nI got knowledge and other suckers lack it\nSo, when you see Dre, a DJ on the mic\nAsk what it's like, it's like we getting hype tonight\nCause if I strike, it ain't for your good health\nBut I won't strike if you just\n\nExpress yourself\nCome on and do it", "image": "https://images.genius.com/845c60a34ea88b98e594ea44eef7b6ff.1000x1000x1.jpg", "artist": "N.W.A", "raw": {"annotation_count": 39, "api_path": "/songs/6143", "description": {"dom": {"tag": "root", "children": [{"tag": "p", "children": ["A Dr. Dre solo number that samples and updates Charles Wright\u2019s ", {"tag": "a", "attributes": {"href": "https://genius.com/Charles-wright-and-the-watts-103rd-st-rhythm-band-express-yourself-annotated"}, "data": {"api_path": "/songs/128630"}, "children": ["1970s song of the same name"]}, ".

(Express yourself)\n\nI'm expressing with my full capabilities\nAnd now I'm living in correctional facilities\nCause some don't agree with how I do this\nI get straight, meditate like a Buddhist\nI'm dropping flavor, my behavior is hereditary\nBut my technique is very necessary\nBlame it on Ice Cube, because he says it gets funky\nWhen you got a subject and a predicate\nAdd it on a dope beat and that'll make you think\nSome suckers just tickle me pink\nTo my stomach, cause they don't flow like this one\nYou know what? I won't hesitate to dis one\nOr two before I'm through, so don't try to sing this\nSome drop science, well I'm dropping English\nEven if Yella makes it a cappella\nI still express, yo I don't smoke weed or sess\nCause it's known to give a brother brain damage\nAnd brain damage on the mic don't manage nothing\nBut making a sucker and you equal, don't be another sequel\n\nExpress yourself\nCome on and do it\n\nNow, getting back to the PG\nThat's program, and it's easy\nDre is back, new jacks are made hollow\nExpressing ain't their subject because they like to follow\nThe words, the style, the trend, the records I spin\nAgain and again and again, yo, you on the other end\nWatch a brother saying dope rhymes with no help\nThere's no fessing and guessing while I'm expressing myself\nIt's crazy to see people be\nWhat society wants them to be, but not me\nRuthless is the way to go, they know\nOthers say rhymes that fail to be original\nOr they kill where the hip-hop starts\nForget about the ghetto and rap for the pop charts\nSome musicians cuss at home\nBut scared to use profanity when up on the microphone\nYeah, they want reality but you won't hear none\nThey rather exaggerate a little fiction\nSome say no to drugs and take a stand\nBut after the show they go looking for the dopeman\nOr they ban my group from the radio, hear N.W.A and say \"Hell no!\"\nBut you know it ain't all about wealth as long as you make a note to...\n\nExpress yourself\nCome on and do it\n\nFrom the heart cause if you wanna start to move up the chart\nThen expression is a big part of it\nYou ain't efficient when you flow\nYou ain't swift, moving like a tortoise, full of rigor mortis\nThere's a little bit more to show\nI got rhymes in my mind, embedded like an embryo\nOr a lesson, all of 'em expression\nAnd if you start fessing, I got a Smith and Wesson for you\nI might ignore your record because it has no bottom\nI get loose in the summer, winter, spring and autumn\nIt's Dre on the mic, getting physical\nDoing the job, N.W.A is the lynch mob\nYes, I'm macabre but you know you need this\nAnd the knowledge is growing, just like a fetus\nOr a tumor but here's the rumor\nDre is in the neighborhood and he's up to no good\nWhen I start expressing myself, Yella slam it\nCause If I stay funky like this, I'm doing damage\nOr I'mma be too hyped and need a straight jacket\nI got knowledge and other suckers lack it\nSo, when you see Dre, a DJ on the mic\nAsk what it's like, it's like we getting hype tonight\nCause if I strike, it ain't for your good health\nBut I won't strike if you just\n\nExpress yourself\nCome on and do it"}}, {"title": "Express Yourself [Extended Mix]", "album": "Straight Outta Compton", "year": "1988-03-27", "lyrics": "Dr. Dre: Yo man there's alot of brothers out there flakin and perpatratin who scared to kick reality\nIce Cube: Yo Dre you've been doin all this dope producin', you ain't had a chance to show 'em what time it is\nDr. Dre: So watch do you want me to do\n\nAll you got to do now, express yourself\n\nI'm expressin' with my full capabilities\nNow I'm livin' in correctional facilities\n'Cause some don't agree with how I do this\nI get straight, meditate, like a Buddhist\nI'm droppin' flavor, my behavior is hereditary\nBut my technique is very necessary\nBlame it on Ice Cube, because he said it gets funky\nWhen you got a subject and a predicate\nAdd it on a dope beat, and it'll make ya think\nSome suckers just tickle me pink, to my stomach\n'Cause they don't flow like this one\nYou know what, I won't hesitate to dis one or two before I'm through\nSo don't try to sing this\nSome drop science, well I'm droppin' English\nEven if Yella, makes it a-capella\nI still express, yo I don't smoke weed or sess\n'Cause it's known to give a brother brain damage\nAnd brain damage on the mic don't manage nothin'\nBut makin' a sucker and you equal\nDon't be another sequel\n\nExpress yourself\nDo it good\nExpress yourself\nOh do it\n\nIce Cube, is not for the pop charts\nSo where should a brother like you start expressin' yourself\nMy boy'll show you how\nYo Dre  - What up?

"Dr. Dre: Yo man there's alot of brothers out there flakin and perpatratin who scared to kick reality\nIce Cube: Yo Dre you've been doin all this dope producin', you ain't had a chance to show 'em what time it is\nDr. Dre: So watch do you want me to do\n\nAll you got to do now, express yourself\n\nI'm expressin' with my full capabilities\nNow I'm livin' in correctional facilities\n'Cause some don't agree with how I do this\nI get straight, meditate, like a Buddhist\nI'm droppin' flavor, my behavior is hereditary\nBut my technique is very necessary\nBlame it on Ice Cube, because he said it gets funky\nWhen you got a subject and a predicate\nAdd it on a dope beat, and it'll make ya think\nSome suckers just tickle me pink, to my stomach\n'Cause they don't flow like this one\nYou know what, I won't hesitate to dis one or two before I'm through\nSo don't try to sing this\nSome drop science, well I'm droppin' English\nEven if Yella, makes it a-capella\nI still express, yo I don't smoke weed or sess\n'Cause it's known to give a brother brain damage\nAnd brain damage on the mic don't manage nothin'\nBut makin' a sucker and you equal\nDon't be another sequel\n\nExpress yourself\nDo it good\nExpress yourself\nOh do it\n\nIce Cube, is not for the pop charts\nSo where should a brother like you start expressin' yourself\nMy boy'll show you how\nYo Dre  - What up? - Drop English right about...\n....Now, gettin' back to the PG\nThat's program, and it's easy\nDre is back - New jacks are made hollow\nExpressin' ain't their subject because they like to follow the words\nThe style, the trend, the records I spin\nAgain and again and again\nYo ya on the other end\nWatch a brother playin' dope rhymes, with no help\nThere's no fessin' and guessin' while I'm expressin myself\nIt's crazy to see people be what society wants 'em to be\nBut not me\nRuthless, is the way to go, they know\nOthers say rhymes that fail to be original\nOr they kill where the hip-hop starts\nForget about the ghetto, and rap for the pop charts\nAnd those musicians, curse at home\nBut scared to use profanity, when up on the microphone\nYeah they want reality, but you won't hear none\nThey rather exaggerate a little fiction\nSome say no to drugs, and take a stand\nBut after the show they go lookin for the dope man\nOh they ban my group from the radio\nHear N.W.A. and say ''Hell no!''\nBut you know it ain't all about wealth\nAs long as you make a note to\n(express yourself)\n\nExpress yourself\nDo it do...\nExpress yourself\nOh do it!\n\nA lyricist, yo Dre is the name for it\nTo make somethin' dope on a record that's what he came for\nKickin' reality yo but staying hisself\nBut it's important to keep it in mind to (Express yourself)\nFrom the heart if you wanna start to move up the chart then\nExpression is big part of it\nYou ain't efficient when you flow, you ain't swift\nMovin' like a tortise, full of rigor mortis\nThere's a little bit more to show\nI got rhymes in my mind, embedded like an embryo\nOr a lesson, all of them expression\nAnd if you start fessin', I got a Smith&Wesson for ya\nI might ignore your record, because it has no bottom\nI get loose in the Summer, Winter, Spring and Autumn\nIt's Dre on the mic gettin physical\nDoin' the job, NWA is the lynch mob\nYes I'm macabre, but you know you need this\nAnd the knowledge is growin' just like a fetus\nOr a tumor, but here's the rumour, Dre's in the neighborhood and he's up to no good\nWhen I start expressin myself, Yella slam it\n'Cause if I stay funky like this, I'm doin' damage\nOr

and lick up the dick\nNow how many nuts would it take for me\nTo let that bitch graduate to lesson three, let's see\n(Splash splash splash splash splash splash)\nAs you can see I straight waxed that ass\nBack up bitch unless you want nut in your eye\nI never never ever ever seen a bitch cry\nNut one, nut two, nut four, five, six\nI lost the third nut in the mix, fuck it!\n(Hey yo Yella boy, why don't you rewind it!)\nSix, five, four, now three is up\nGimme that gimme that gimme that nut\nYou wanna feel the dick baby try your luck\nBecause the E likes to fuck fuck fuck yo\nI get 'em stuck-on

you know most ho's knows not to clown\nCause if a bitch tries to diss me while I'm full of liquor\nI smack the bitch up and shoot the nigga that's with her\nThat's the kind of nigga that you're listenin' to\nTalk to you for a minute then my dick's in you\nYo now every single bitch got a price to pay\nUp on the dicks of N.W.A\nI find 'em fuck 'em and flee you know\nBut before I D.O. - yo, I take a hoe to the hotel\nTo the motel, to the holiday inn (say what?)\nIf that bitch start fuckin' up, yo\nI'll just fuck her friend\n\nNow MC Ren\nWhat up?\nMy mellow\nA check it out\nIt's on you - so what the fuck you're gonna do?\n\nNow gather around y'all, and check it out y'all\nAnd all the bitches come and suck up on my balls y'all\nAnd take a ticket to play with it like a Slinky\nSo put your lips on my big chocolate twinkie\nAnd you swallow all the nut if you bitches are smart\nTo make my dick pop up like a Pop-Tart\nBut after I nut I'mma leave ya\nBut first I must deceive ya, because bitch I don't need ya\nAnd don't say that you love me too\nCause if I turn my back you would fuck the whole crew\nYou're nothin' but a stank ho' tryin' to take my bank ho'\nSo I have to let

What did I do?\nJust shut the fuck up\nAnd get your motherfucking ass on the floor!\n(You heard the man, shut the fuck up!)\nBut I didn't do shit\nMan, just shut the fuck up!\nEazy-E, won't you step up to the stand\nAnd tell the jury how you feel about this bullshit?\n\nI'm tired of the motherfuckin' jackin'\nSweating my gang, while I'm chillin' in the shack, and\nShining the light in my face, and for what?\nMaybe it's because I kick so much butt\nI kick ass, or maybe \u2018cause I blast\nOn a stupid ass nigga when I'm playing with the trigger\nOf an Uzi or an AK\n\u2018Cause the police always got somethin' stupid to say\nThey put out my picture with silence\n\u2018Cause my identity by itself causes violence\nThe E with the criminal behavior\nYeah, I'm a gangsta, but still I got flavor\nWithout a gun and a badge, what do you got?\nA sucker in a uniform waiting to get shot\nBy me, or another nigga\nAnd with a gat, it don't matter if he's smaller or bigger\n(Size don't mean shit, he's from the old school, fool!)\nAnd as you all know, E's here to rule\nWhenever I'm rollin', keep lookin' in the mirror\nAnd ears on cue, yo, so I can hear a\nDumb motherfucker with a gun\nAnd if I'm rollin' off the 8, he'll be the one\nThat I take out, and then get away\nWhile I'm driving off laughing, this is what I'll say\n\nFuck tha police!\nFuck tha police!\nFuck tha police!\nFuck tha police!\n\nThe verdict:\nThe jury has found you guilty of being a redneck\nWhite bread, chickenshit motherfucker\nWait, that's a lie! That's a goddamn lie!\nGet him out of here!\nI want justice!\nGet him the fuck out my face!\nI want justice!\nOut, right now!\nFuck you, you black motherfuckers!\n\nFuck tha police!\nFuck tha police!\nFuck tha police!\nFuck tha police!", "image": "https://images.genius.com/845c60a34ea88b98e594ea44eef7b6ff.1000x1000x1.jpg", "artist": "N.W.A", "raw": {"annotation_count": 46, "api_path": "/songs/243", "description": {"dom": {"tag": "root", "children": [{"tag": "p", "children": ["\u201cFuck tha Police\u201d takes the form of a trial against the LAPD, with Dr. Dre, MC Ren, and Ice Cube as judge, court officer, and witness."]}, "", {"tag": "p", "children": ["Dr. Dre explained the song was created after the members of N.W.A were forced by police to lay face down in the street with guns to their heads.", {"tag": "br"}, "However, the reason why the police were harassing them was because Eazy-E was doing drive-bys shootings on innocent people on bus stops with a paintball gun, as Dre explains below:"]}, "", {"tag": "p", "children": [{"tag": "a", "attributes": {"href": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aK4OZopbONI", "rel": "nofollow"}, "children": ["https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aK4OZopbONI"]}]}, "", {"tag": "p", "children": ["The song caught the attention ", {"tag": "a", "attributes": {"href": "http://articles.latimes.com/1989-10-05/entertainment/ca-1046_1_law-enforcement", "rel": "nofollow"}, "children": ["of the FBI"]}, ", which sent a letter to Priority Records about N.W.A\u2019s album.

order, order!\nIce Cube, take the motherfucking stand\nDo you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth\nAnd nothing but the truth so help your black ass?\nYou goddamn right!\nWell, won't you tell everybody what the fuck you gotta say?\n\nFuck the police! Comin' straight from the underground\nA young nigga got it bad \u2018cause I'm brown\nAnd not the other color, so police think\nThey have the authority to kill a minority\nFuck that shit, \u2018cause I ain't the one\nFor a punk motherfucker with a badge and a gun\nTo be beating on, and thrown in jail\nWe can go toe-to-toe in the middle of a cell\nFuckin' with me \u2018cause I'm a teenager\nWith a little bit of gold and a pager\nSearchin' my car, lookin' for the product\nThinkin' every nigga is sellin' narcotics\nYou'd rather see me in the pen\nThan me and Lorenzo rollin' in a Benz-o\nBeat a police out of shape\nAnd when I'm finished, bring the yellow tape\nTo tape off the scene of the slaughter\nStill getting swole off bread and water\nI don't know if they fags or what\nSearch a nigga down, and grabbing his nuts\nAnd on the other hand, without a gun, they can't get none\nBut don't let it be a black and a white one\n\u2018Cause they'll slam ya down to the street top\nBlack police showing out for the white cop\nIce Cube will swarm\nOn any motherfucker in a blue uniform\nJust \u2018cause I'm from the CPT\nPunk police are afraid of me\nHuh, a young nigga on the warpath\nAnd when I'm finished, it's gonna be a bloodbath\nOf cops, dying in L.A\nYo, Dre, I got something to say\n\nFuck tha police!\nFuck tha police!\nFuck tha police!\nFuck tha police!\n\nPull your goddamn ass over right now!\nAww shit, now, what the fuck you pullin' me over for?\n\u2018Cause I feel like it!\nJust sit your ass on the curb and shut the fuck up!\nMan, fuck this shit!\nA'ight, smartass, I'm taking your black ass to jail!\nMC Ren, will you please give your testimony\nTo the jury about this fucked up incident?\n\nFuck the police! And Ren said it with authority\nBecause the niggas on the street is a majority\nA gang is with whoever I'm steppin'\nAnd the motherfuckin' weapon is kept in\nA stash spot, for the so-called law\nWishing Ren was a nigga that they never saw\nLights start flashing behind me\nBut they're scared of a nigga, so they mace me to blind me\nBut that shit don't work, I just laugh\nBecause it gives them a hint not to step in my path\nFor police, I'm saying, \"Fuck you, punk!\"\nReading my rights and shit, it's all junk\nPulling out a silly club, so you stand\nWith a fake-ass badge and a gun in your hand\nBut take off the gun so you can see what's up\nAnd we'll go at it, punk, and I'ma fuck you up!\nMake you think I'ma kick your ass\nBut drop your gat, and Ren's gonna blast\nI'm sneaky as fuck when it comes to crime\nBut I'ma smoke them now and not next time\nSmoke any motherfucker that sweats me\nOr any asshole that threatens me\nI'm a sniper with a hell of a scope\nTaking out a cop or two, they can't cope with me\nThe motherfuckin' villain that's mad\nWith potential to get bad as fuck\nSo I'ma turn it around\nPut in my clip, yo, and this is the sound\n(Gunshot sounds)\nYeah, somethin' like that\nBut it all depends on the size of the gat\nTaking out a police would make my day\nBut a nigga like Ren don't give a fuck to say\u2026\n\nFuck tha police!\nFuck tha police!\nFuck tha police!\nFuck tha police!\n\n(Knocking sounds)\nYeah, man, what you need?\nPolice, open out!\nAww, shit\nWe have a warrant for Eazy-E's arrest\nGet down and put your hands right where I can see 'em!\n(Move, motherfucker, move now!)\nWhat the fuck did I do, man? What did I do?\nJust shut the fuck up\nAnd get your motherfucking ass on the floor!\n(You heard the man, shut the fuck up!)\nBut I didn't do shit\nMan, just shut the fuck up!\nEazy-E, won't you step up to the stand\nAnd tell the jury how you feel about this bullshit?\n\nI'm tired of the motherfuckin' jackin'\nSweating my gang, while I'm chillin' in the shack, and\nShining the light in my face, and for what?\nMaybe it's because I kick so much butt\nI kick ass, or maybe \u2018cause I blast\nOn a stupid ass nigga when I'm playing with the trigger\nOf an Uzi or an AK\n\u2018Cause the police always got somethin' stupid to say\nThey put out my picture with silence\n\u2018Cause my identity by itself causes violence\nThe E with the criminal behavior\nYeah, I'm a gangsta, but still I got flavor\nWithout a gun and a badge, what do you got?\nA sucker in a uniform waiting to get shot\nBy me, or another nigga\nAnd with a gat, it don't matter if he's smaller or bigger\n(Size don't mean shit, he's from the old school, fool!)\nAnd as you all know, E's here to rule\nWhenever I'm rollin', keep lookin' in the mirror\nAnd ears on cue, yo, so I can hear a\nDumb motherfucker with a gun\nAnd if I'm rollin' off the 8, he'll be the one\nThat I take out, and then get away\nWhile I'm driving off laughing, this is what I'll say\n\nFuck tha police!\nFuck tha police!\nFuck tha police!\nFuck tha police!\n\nThe verdict:\nThe jury has found you guilty of being a redneck\nWhite bread, chickenshit motherfucker\nWait, that's a lie! That's a goddamn lie!\nGet him out of here!\nI want justice!\nGet him the fuck out my face!\nI want justice!\nOut, right now!\nFuck you, you black motherfuckers!\n\nFuck tha police!\nFuck tha police!\nFuck tha police!\nFuck tha police!"}}, {"title": "Fuck Tha Police (Insert)", "album": "N.W.A.

penitentiary\nIce Cube would like to say\nThat I'm a crazy motha from around the way\nSince I was a youth, I smoked weed out\nNow I'm the type of punk that you read about\nDoin' a crime or two, that's what the hell I do\nYou don't like how I'm livin well !\nThis is a crew, and I'm in it\nMy man Dre'll knock you out in a minute\nWith a right left, right left you're toothless\nAnd then you say -- damn they ruthless!\nWe'll make you say it again \nN.W.A's messing up the program\nAnd then you realize we don't care\nWe don't just say no, we're too busy saying: \"Yeah\"\nAbout drinking straight out the eight bottle\nTell the truth -- do I look like a role model?\nTo a kid looking up to me\nLife ain't nothin but girls and money\nCause I'm the type of brotha that's built to last\nWe had some in the present, some in the past\nBut I don't give a damn cause I keep bailing\nYo, tell em what they yelling\n\nGangsta gangsta, that's what they're yelling\n(It's not about a salary, it's all about reality)\nGangsta, Gangsta\n(He'll tell you exactly how he feel, and don't want a thing back)\n\nHomies all standing around, just hanging\nSome dope-dealing, some gang-banging\nWe decide to roll and we deep\nSee a sucka on Daytons and we creep\nReal slow, and before you know\nI had my AK pointed in the window\nCheck it in, punk, or I might blast\nHe got scared and hit the gas\nWe tried to catch him, but you all know\nYou can't catch a five point oh, so\nWe headed right back to the fort\nSweatin\u2019 all the girls in the biker shorts\nWe didn't get no play, from the ladies\nWith six thugs in a car are you crazy?\nShe was scared, and it was showing\nWe all said  and kept going\nTo the hood, and we was fin to\nLook for somethin\u2019 else to get into\nLike a new female, or in fact\nA bum rush, but we call it rat pack\nOn a sucka for nothin\u2019 at all\nIce Cube'll go stupid when I'm full of eight ball\nI might stumble, but still won't lose\nNow I'm dressed in the county blues\nCause I'm the type of brotha that's built to last\nWe had some in the present, some in the past\nBut I don't give a damn cause I keep bailin'\nYo, tell em what they yellin'\n\nWait a minute, wait a minute, cut this\n(Man whatcha gonna do now?)\n\"What we're gonna do right here is go way back\"\nHow far you goin back? \"Way back\"\n\"As we go a lil somethin like this\"\n\nHere's a lil gangsta, short in size\nA t-shirt and Levi's is his only disguise\nBuilt like a tank yet hard to hit\nIce Cube and Eazy E  cold rockin' it\n\nWell I'm Eazy E the one they're talkin about\nSucka tried to roll the dice and just crapped out\nPolice tried to roll, so it's time to go\nI creeped away real slow and jumped in the six-fo'\nWith the \"Diamond in the back, sun-roof top\"\nDiggin' the scene with the gangsta lean\nCause I'm the E, I don't slang or bang\nI just knock suckas out like it ain't no thang\nAnd all the ladies, you know I'm talkin to you\n\"We love you Eazy!\" Yeah, I love you too\nBecause you see, you know I gotta be legit\n(So let me tell you stupid suckas who you're messing with]\nCause I'm the type of brotha that's built to last\nWe had some in the present, some in the past\nBut I don't give a damn cause I keep bailin'\nYo, tell em what they yellin'\n\nGangsta, Gangsta, that's what they're yelling\n(It's not about a salary, it's all about reality)\nGangsta, Gangsta\n(He'll...up you and yours, and anything that gets in his way)\nGangsta, Gangsta, that's what they're yelling\n(It's not about a salary, it's all about reality)\nGangsta, Gangsta\n(He'll just call you a low-life mother..., and talk about your funky ways)"}}, {"title": "Hello", "album": "War & Peace Vol. 2 (The Peace Disc)", "year": null, "lyrics": "Look at these niggas with attitudes\nLook at these niggas

I'm from the street, so I know what's up\nOn these silly games that's played by the women\nI'm only happy when I'm goin up in em\nBut you know, I'm a menace to society\nBut girls in biker shorts are so fly to me\nSo I step to em, with aggression\nListen to the kid, and learn a lesson today\nSee they think we narrow minded\nCause they got a cute face, and big-behinded\nSo I walk over and say \"How ya doin'?\"\nSee I'm only down for screwin', but you know\nYa gotta play it off cool\nCause if they catch you slipping, you'll get schooled\nAnd they'll get you for your money, son\nNext thing you know you're getting their hair and they nails done\nFool, and they'll let you show em off\nBut when it comes to sex, they got a bad cough\nOr a headache, it's all give\nAnd no take\nRun out of money, and watch your heart break\nThey'll drop you like a bad habit\nCause a brother with money yo, they gotta have it\nMessing with me though, they gets none\nYou can't juice Ice Cube girl, cause I ain't

Cause if they ain't got no money, they can't do nothin for me but get out of my face.\nI know what you mean, girl; it ain't nothin right jumpin off unless he got dollars!\n\nSometimes I used to wonder\nHow the hell an ugly dude get a fine girl's number\nHe's getting juiced for his ducats\nI tell a girl in a minute yo, I drive a bucket\nAnd won't think nutting of it\nShe can ride or walk, either leave it or love it\nI show her that I'm not the O, the N-E, say\nI'm a ruthless N-I double-G A\nCause I'm gamin on a female that's gamin on me\nYou know I spell girl with a B\nA brother like me is only out for one thing\nI think with my ding-a-ling, but I won't bring no\nFlowers to your doorstep, when we goin out\nCause you'll take it for granted, no doubt\nAnd after the date, I'mma want to do the wild thing\nYou want lobster, huh? I'm thinking Burger King\nAnd when I take you, you get frustrated\nYou can't juice Ice Cube and you hate it\nBut you see, I don't go nuts\nOver girls like you with the BIG ol butts\nIt start comin out the pocket, to knock it\nBut when the damage is done\nYou can only lay me girl, you can't play me girl\nFor the simple fact that, I ain't the one\n\nI don't care how they look; if they got money, we can hook up but they ain't gettin none.\nYeah I just make em think they gonna get some, play with they mind a lil bit, and get that money. Oh Ice Cube, can I have some money pleeeease?\n\nGive you money? Why bother?\nCause you know I'm looking nothing like your father\nGirl, I can't be played or ganked\nGanked means getting took for your bank\nOr your gold or your money or something\nNine times outta ten, she's giving up nothing\nThey get mad when I put it in perspective\nBut let's see if my knowledge is effective\nTo the brothas man they robbing you blind\nCause they fine with a big behind, but pay it no mind\nKeep your money to yourself homie\nAnd if you got enough game\nYou'll get her name and her number\nWithout going under\nYou can't leave em and love and stay above em\nI used to get no play now she stay behind me\nCause I said I had a Benz 190\nBut I lied and played the one\nJust to get some now she feels dumb\nTo my homies it's funny\nBut that's what you get trying to play me for my money\nNow don't you feel used?\nBut I don't give a hoot, huh, because I knock boots\nYou shouldn't be, so damn material\nAnd try to milk Ice Cube like cereal\nNow how many times do I have to say it?\nCause if I have to go get a gun\nYou girls will learn I don't burn\nYou think I'm a sucka, but I ain't the one\n\nBut you said you love me!\nI don't see no rings on this finger\nWhy you doin me like this?

ostrich\nGroupies been waitin' for this, suckers been hatin for this\nYou know why?\n'Cause so many are relatin' to this\nJealous is how they feelin' intentionally\nBut they start to love it because I made it eventually\nPumpin' the music, I keep the music like pumpin'\nCause Ren ain't in here for nothin', I keep the average crowd jumpin'\nYo, you know the colour, the villain's in black\nAlways down to make noise, and attack\nSo you better get back unless you wanna come with it\nAnd make your face like a target and close your eyes when I hit it\nYou're screamin' with fear, but it's with fear that you're screamin'\nYou're wakin up in a sweat 'cause Ren is givin' bad dreams and\nI'm not schemin', I'm just tellin the facts\nThat's how it is when N.W.A. starts to jack\nSo brothers that wanna scrap with me\nThat sweezin' and sneezin' will have to lap with me\nEspecially beggin' to write some lyrics with me\nI just snatch your girl to take a nap with me\n'Cause when it comes to Ren there's no comparison\nAnd if you try to be me, it's quite embarrassin'\nBut I understand cause you're mentally slow\nCause I can tell from the jump you're too nervous to go\n\nIf it ain't' ruff, it ain't me *scratching noise*\n(The gangsta's black and he's about to attack)\nIf it ain't ruff, it ain't me *scratching noise*\nLemme bust a freestyle then(Alright bet)\n\nI can tell that you're afraid to fight me\nSimple because you lost the crowd and they had to invite me\nBecause your sweat is a puddle, but there's a puddle o' sweat\nI'm a threat, so get a cold rag and wipe your neck\nAnd clean the dirt off your face that causes acne\nIt's ridiculous thinkin' that you can jack me\nThis is the round where the punch will go\nInto your H-E-A-D; that's known as a blow\nI'm makin a point, but it's a point that I'm makin\nLike, see, I'm hatin' the fakin' I keep the suckers like shakin'\nScared to speak with a thought when they're chosen\nThe sound of my voice in their ear and they're frozen\nThis is a battle to the death, it's like the same ol'\nAgainst a brother on a tip, with a Kangol\nGivin' a pain, but it's with pain that I'm givin\nBut I'm comparin' and tearin' em but I'm makin a livin'\nWith the hype of a nine volt battery\nAnd the odds for me to conquer is averagely\nGood, meanin' I'mma flow\nI'm from the streets so, yo, I'm ready to go\n\nIf it ain't ruff, it ain't me (Yo Ren)\nIf it ain't ruff, it ain't me\n(Man what'chya gonna do now?) Get funky\n\nThe 'do not disturb' sign is in effect\nWhile I'm thinkin of a fool to select\nTo give the victim the verdict, so for the verdict a victim\nSlammin' my vocals on a dance with the rest then I kick them\nTell 'em they're guilty, and peep out the bailer\nAnd get a new track o' drums so I can play with\nPercussion, pumpin' it loud when I perform\nYo, you wanna play in my game, put on a uniform\nIt ain't a rule in the book you have to go by\nHey, cause when it comes to cheatin', yo, you should know I\nFor fear in the hearts cause it's the hearts full of fear\n'Cause what you hear in your ear is something funky and clear\nThe Hulk was incredible, yo, but Ren he was super\nBut now I'm ruthless, a civilian and not a trooper\nBut a soldier with a top rankin\nGivin' dope material, the hell with the gankin'\nSo play like an airplane and just jet\nAnd keep your blood pressure low 'cause I'm a threat, 'cause if not\nI'm afraid of the show\nThat you're a sucker and you're too nervous to go\n\nIf it ain't ruff, it ain't me (Yo Ren)\nIf it ain't ruff, it ain't me (Yo Ren)\n(The gangsta's black) If it ain't, if it ain't\n*scratching noise*"}}, {"title": "It ain't ruff", "album": null, "year": null, "lyrics": "Ren is the villain and you're just an hostage\nSo whenever I'm steppin cover your head like an ostrich\nGroupies been waitin for this, suckers been hatin for this\nYou know why ?

suckers been hatin for this\nYou know why ? Because so many are relatin to this\nJealous is how they feel it intentionally\nBut they start to love it becoz I made it eventually\nPumpin the music I keep the music like pumpin\nCoz Ren ain't in here for nuthin, I keep the average crowd jumpin\nYo, you know the color, the villain's in black\nAlways down to make noise, and attack\nSo you better get back unless you wanna come with it\nAnd make your face like a target and close your eyes when I hit it\nYou're screamin with fear but it's with fear that you're screamin\nYou're wakin up in a sweat coz Ren is givin bad dreams and\nI'm not schemin, I'm just tellin the facts\nThat's how it is when N.W.A. starts to jack\nSo brothers that wanna scr*p with me\nThat sweezin and sneezin will have to lap with me\nEspecially beggin to write some lyrics with me\nI just snatch your girl to take a nap with me\nCoz when it comes to Ren there's no comparison\nAnd if you try to be me, it's quite embarassin\nBut I understand coz you're mentally slow\nCoz I can tell from the jump you're too nervous to go\nIf it ain't' ruff it ain't me (scratch)\nIf it ain't ruff it ain't me (scratch)\nLemme bust a freestyle here \nI can tell that you're afraid to fight me\nSimple because you lost the crowd and they had to invite me\nBecoz you're sweat as a puddle but there's a puddle o' sweat\nI'm a threath, so get a cold rag and wipe your neck\nAnd clean the dirt off your face that calls acne\nIt's ridiculous thinkin that you can jack me\nThis is the round where the punch will go\nUntil ya A G-A-T that's known as a flow\nI'm makin a point but it's a point that I'm makin\nLike, see, I'm hatin the fakin I keep the suckers like shakin\nScared to speak with a tongue and they're chozen\nThe sound of my voice in their ear and they're frozen\nThis is a battle to the death, it's like the \nAgainst a brother on a tip, with \nGivin a pain but it's with pain that I'm givin\nBut I'm comparin and tearin'em but I'm makin a livin\nWith the hype of a 9 Volt battery\nAnd the odds for me to conquer is averagely good\nMeanin I'm a flow\nI'm from the streets so, yo, I'm ready to go\nIf it ain't ruff it ain't me \nIf it ain't ruff it ain't me\nThe 'do not disturb' sign is in effect\nWhile I'm thinkin of a fool to select\nTo give the victim the verdict so for the verdict a victim\nSlammin my vocals on a dance with the rest then I kick them\nTell'em they're guilty, and beep out the bailer\nAnd get a new track o' drums so I can play with\nPercussion; pumpin it loud when I perform\nYo, you wanna play in my game, put on a uniform\nIt ain't a rule in the book you have to go by\nHey, coz when it comes to cheatin yo you should know I\nFor fear in the hearts coz it's the hearts full of fear\nCoz what you hear in your ear is something funky and clear\nThe hump was incredible yo but Ren he was super\nBut now I'm ruthless, a civilian and not a trooper\nBut a soldier with a top rankin\nGivin dope material, the hell with the gankin\nSo play like an airplane and just jet\nAnd keep your blood pressure low coz I'm a , if not\nI'm afraid of the show\nThat you're a sucker and you're too nervous to go\nIf it ain't ruff it ain't me \nIf it ain't ruff it ain't me \n If it ain't ... If it ain't\n(scratching)"}}, {"title": "Just Don't Bite It", "album": "100 Miles and Runnin'", "year": "1990-08-14", "lyrics": "God damn, now lick my balls, oh shit\n You like that?\nPut 'em off\n It's good?\nOuch, shit, godamn bitch you bit' my damn\nShit I said suck the mothafucka, you're bitin' it, shit!\n\nHas this ever happened to you?\nDoes her teeth get in the way while she's sucking your dick?\nDoes she know how to suck a dick?\nWell, I had that same problem until my bitch went out and bought N.W.A's new book entitled \"The Art of Sucking Dick\"\n\nLesson 1 - First you grab the dick\nNext you gently lick it up and down, then insert it into the mouth\nTake it slow, don't rush it, and before you know it ..\nSPLASH!\n\nIt goes one for the treble, two for the bass\nShe got nut all over her face\nKick kick it ...\n\nSlow is the tempo, and Ren is gonna flow\nAs I produce and illustrate you to a ho\nCaught on the late night, stamping on the base-pipe\nShe's a hype to get you on the late flight\nBut back in school she was a cutie, yo\nThen after graduation started giving up the booty\nIn school, stuck her head in a feather\nEvery time I asked her what's the time\nIt was never ever what she would talk to the Ren I'm sayin'\nI wanted a date, she wouldn't even be my friend\nBut now in the 1990's, I'd be praying that the bitch don't find me\nCause she's got a gang o' kidz nappy-heads and all dirty\nAnd she's getting pimped by a nigga that's thirty\nI saw her hanging in an alley\nRaggin to her friends how she's ho'in' in the valley\nAll by herself, doin' on the ho stroll\nComin back home late night with the bankroll\nYou know a bitch like that makes me sick\nBut I've heard that she sucks a good dick!\n\nIt's the world's biggest dick\nDon't matter just don't bite it\nIt's the world's biggest dick\nDon't matter just don't bite it\n\"What do you want me to do with it?\"\nDon't matter just don't bite it\nShe swallowed it (yeah)\n\nAt a high school dance, me and the niggas bailed in\nI saw her sittin' with her friends, with the clan\nSo sexy, thought she was all that\nShe wouldn't even look at us because we wore the black hat\nShe was a stuck-up bitch on the public floor\nBut an instant prostitute behind closed doors\nOn the streets she's a late night feature\nWalking home from school, I saw her sucking a nigga's dick under the bleachers\nShe saw me and she ran and tried to hide her face\nBut a bitch full of nut couldn't escape in the chase\nA disgrace, If I ever ever saw one\nThere wasn't a nigga on the block late at night not getting done\nSo she begged me not to tell a soul\nThen I said of course, cause my dick, yo, it's harder than a totem pole\nThen again it don't concern me\nCause there's a slight chance if I fuck she might burn me\nAnd then I might have to shoot the ho\nI mean checking with the quickness just to let her know\nBut to prevent from getting sick -\nI would just prefer to let her come and suck my dick\n\nIt's the world's biggest dick\nDon't matter just don't bite it\nIt's the world's biggest dick\nDon't matter just don't bite it\n\"What do you want me to do with it?\"\nDon't matter just don't bite it\nShe swallowed it (yeah)\n\nNow I was at a club on a late late Sunday\nPeeping at the bitches 'till the next day Monday\nHad a couple of drinks, so I was feeling good\nAnd suddenly I saw this bitch  that lives in my neighborhood\nShe went to church every week so now I lucked up\nShe was at the end of the bar gettin' fucked up\nBack at the house she was bitch n' be ignoring\nAnd when she start to talk the ho' was kinda boring\nYo, but now I got to dawn, see\nNow she's dancing on the floor with a skirt and no panties on\nShaking that ass like a salt shaker\nI already got my plans -\nJust while I'm a take her to a room\nBut yo I mean a rest room\nAnd stick my dick in her mouth like a wet broom\nSo I grabbed her hand and she's wit(h) it\nSo when she turns sober, she'll never admit it\nSo while she's dropped I'd better get it quick\nAnd see for myself if she sucks a good dick!\n\nIt's the world's biggest dick\nDon't matter just don't bite it\nIt's the world's biggest dick\nDon't matter just don't bite it\n\"What do you want me to do with it?\"\nDon't matter just don't bite it\nShe swallowed it (yeah)\n\n\"So there you have it - a job well done (She swallowed it)\nBut for now let me get back to what I was doing\" (She swallowed it)\nGet it\nWhat the fuck suck this dick bitch\nYeah, here comes\nOoh shit, goddamn\nGoddamn\nGet it all baby, get it all\nSuck this dick, suck this dick, suck this dick for daddy baby\nSuck this dick\nYou know you like it\nSuck it\nOh she swallowed it\nShe swallowed, oh shit, get it all, get it all, suck this dick, suck this dick, suck this dick for daddy ..\nWait till I tell the fellas how you sucked this dick\nHey matter of fact, I want you to suck Dre's dick\nThen I want you to suck Yella dick\nYou already sucked Ren's dick\nYOU BOYS ARE DISGUSTING!\nJust suck my dick bitch... cause I'm a nigga wit an attitude!", "image": "https://images.genius.com/1f1306ebc3ce5d611ce103d6c1bc8880.944x936x1.jpg", "artist": "N.W.A", "raw":

mothafucka, you're bitin' it, shit!\n\nHas this ever happened to you?\nDoes her teeth get in the way while she's sucking your dick?\nDoes she know how to suck a dick?\nWell, I had that same problem until my bitch went out and bought N.W.A's new book entitled \"The Art of Sucking Dick\"\n\nLesson 1 - First you grab the dick\nNext you gently lick it up and down, then insert it into the mouth\nTake it slow, don't rush it, and before you know it ..\nSPLASH!\n\nIt goes one for the treble, two for the bass\nShe got nut all over her face\nKick kick it ...\n\nSlow is the tempo, and Ren is gonna flow\nAs I produce and illustrate you to a ho\nCaught on the late night, stamping on the base-pipe\nShe's a hype to get you on the late flight\nBut back in school she was a cutie, yo\nThen after graduation started giving up the booty\nIn school, stuck her head in a feather\nEvery time I asked her what's the time\nIt was never ever what she would talk to the Ren I'm sayin'\nI wanted a date, she wouldn't even be my friend\nBut now in the 1990's, I'd be praying that the bitch don't find me\nCause she's got a gang o' kidz nappy-heads and all dirty\nAnd she's getting pimped by a nigga that's thirty\nI saw her hanging in an alley\nRaggin to her friends how she's ho'in' in the valley\nAll by herself, doin' on the ho stroll\nComin back home late night with the bankroll\nYou know a bitch like that makes me sick\nBut I've heard that she sucks a good dick!\n\nIt's the world's biggest dick\nDon't matter just don't bite it\nIt's the world's biggest dick\nDon't matter just don't bite it\n\"What do you want me to do with it?\"\nDon't matter just don't bite it\nShe swallowed it (yeah)\n\nAt a high school dance, me and the niggas bailed in\nI saw her sittin' with her friends, with the clan\nSo sexy, thought she was all that\nShe wouldn't even look at us because we wore the black hat\nShe was a stuck-up bitch on the public floor\nBut an instant prostitute behind closed doors\nOn the streets she's a late night feature\nWalking home from school, I saw her sucking a nigga's dick under the bleachers\nShe saw me and she ran and tried to hide her face\nBut a bitch full of nut couldn't escape in the chase\nA disgrace, If I ever ever saw one\nThere wasn't a nigga on the block late at night not getting done\nSo she begged me not to tell a soul\nThen I said of course, cause my dick, yo, it's harder than a totem pole\nThen again it don't concern me\nCause there's a slight chance if I fuck she might burn me\nAnd then I might have to shoot the ho\nI mean checking with the quickness just to let her know\nBut to prevent from getting sick -\nI would just prefer to let her come and suck my dick\n\nIt's the world's biggest dick\nDon't matter just don't bite it\nIt's the world's biggest dick\nDon't matter just don't bite it\n\"What do you want me to do with it?\"\nDon't matter just don't bite it\nShe swallowed it (yeah)\n\nNow I was at a club on a late late Sunday\nPeeping at the bitches 'till the next day Monday\nHad a couple of drinks, so I was feeling good\nAnd suddenly I saw this bitch  that lives in my neighborhood\nShe went to church every week so now I lucked up\nShe was at the end of the bar gettin' fucked up\nBack at the house she was bitch n' be ignoring\nAnd when she start to talk the ho' was kinda boring\nYo, but now I got to dawn, see\nNow she's dancing on the floor with a skirt and no panties on\nShaking that ass like a salt shaker\nI already got my plans -\nJust while I'm a take her to a room\nBut yo I mean a rest room\nAnd stick my dick in her mouth like a wet broom\nSo I grabbed her hand and she's wit(h) it\nSo when she turns sober, she'll never admit it\nSo while she's dropped I'd better get it quick\nAnd see for myself if she sucks a good dick!\n\nIt's the world's biggest dick\nDon't matter just don't bite it\nIt's the world's biggest dick\nDon't matter just don't bite it\n\"What do you want me to do with it?\"\nDon't matter just don't bite it\nShe swallowed it (yeah)\n\n\"So there you have it - a job well done (She swallowed it)\nBut for now let me get back to what I was doing\" (She swallowed it)\nGet it\nWhat the fuck suck this dick bitch\nYeah, here comes\nOoh shit, goddamn\nGoddamn\nGet it all baby, get it all\nSuck this dick, suck this dick, suck this dick for daddy baby\nSuck this dick\nYou know you like it\nSuck it\nOh she swallowed it\nShe swallowed, oh shit, get it all, get it all, suck this dick, suck this dick, suck this dick for daddy ..\nWait till I tell the fellas how you sucked this dick\nHey matter of fact, I want you to suck Dre's dick\nThen I want you to suck Yella dick\nYou already sucked Ren's dick\nYOU BOYS ARE DISGUSTING!\nJust suck my dick bitch... cause I'm a nigga wit an attitude!"}}, {"title":

Dat nigga was sayin' he from Compton, he ain't from Compton\nHe from a planet called: \"Punk!\" It is full of pussy protein and pearl tounge\n\nAll I wanna know is why y'all let his punk-ass in the group in the first place, when you knew what kinda bitch he was?\n\nYeah, I was in the New Music Seminar in New York!\nAnd I watched that punk muthafucka run... while the rest of his homeboys got they ass beat!\n\nHello? I'm callin' to say since Ice Cube was suckin' so much New York dick...can he come and eat sum of this Chicago pussy?\n\nI smell...  PUSSY!\n\nYeah, nigga; when we see yo' ass, we gon' cut your hair off and fuck you with' a broomstick!\n\nThink about it, punk muthafucka!"}}, {"title": "Niggaz 4 Life", "album": "Niggaz4Life", "year": "1991-05-28", "lyrics": "Why you brothers insist on usin' the word nigga?\nDon't you know that's bringin' down the black race?\nNigga nigga nigga that's all I hear you motherfuckers talk about is nigga\nYou can do what you want, just keep it out of my neighborhood\nPersonally I think the lyrics are a bit too harsh\nI ain't no nigga, fuck that shit\nDoes everything come out your mouth got to be a 4-letter word?\nAll over this bullshit, it's just a bunch of fuckin' noise\nThe way you talk about women is bullshit, plain bullshit\nWhat you motherfuckers doin' for the black community anyway?\nMotherfucker I got kids, I don't want 'em listenin' to that bullshit\n{*hospital monitor starts beeping*}\nFuck the niggas!\nMotherfuckers need to stop\nHow can you call yourself a nigga and be proud of it?\n{*monitor stops beeping - R.I.P.*}\n Flatline\n Bullshit!\n\nWhy do I call myself a nigga you ask me?\nWell it's because motherfuckers wanna blast me\nAnd run me outta my neighborhood\nAnd label me as a dope dealer yo, and say that I'm no good\nBut I gave out jobs so niggas wouldn't have to go out\nGave em some dope and a corner so they could show out\nWhen the cops came, they gave a fake name\nBecause the life in the streets is just a head game\nSo therefore, to make more\nA 15-year-old black kid'll go and rob a liquor store\nAnd get shot in the process\nHe ate up a nine bullet and now he's put to rest\n\nWhy do I call myself a nigga you ask me?\nI guess it's just the way shit has to be\nBack when I was young gettin' a job was murder\nFuck flippin' burgers, cause I deserve a\nNine-to-five I can be proud of, that I can speak loud of\nAnd to help a nigga get out of\nYo!

see, I don't give a fuck about nothin'\nExcept gettin' paid, gettin' bitches, and issuin' stitches\nWhich is, all needed to read it and find a rhyme\nAnd then it's time to say, the nigga's here to stay\nBut what about the fake niggas, the house niggas\nTo get paid quick they gotta suck a fat dick\nBut N.W.A. is outta your motherfuckin' range\nWe ain't gonna change a motherfuckin' thang!\n\nI call myself a nigga cause my skin won't lighten\nI call myself a nigga cause the shit that I'm writin\nHypes me, hypes other motherfuckers around me\nAnd that's the reason why they wanna surround me\nAnd ask me - why do I call myself a negro?\nAin't none of their fuckin' business cause I'll let the trigger go\nSo get out my presence and get out of my sight\nCause MC Ren is a nigga for life\n\nYou're a nigga 'til you die\nIf you're a po' nigga, you're a po' nigga\nIf you're a rich nigga, you're a rich nigga\nBut you never stop bein' a nigga\nAnd if you get to be educated you just an educated nigga\n(\"I can dig it!\")\n\nIt's plain to see, you can't change me\nCause I'mma be a nigga for life\n{*static noise*}\n\nI'm a nigga, he's a nigga, she's a nigga, we some niggas\nWouldn't

want, just keep it out of my neighborhood\nPersonally I think the lyrics are a bit too harsh\nI ain't no nigga, fuck that shit\nDoes everything come out your mouth got to be a 4-letter word?\nAll over this bullshit, it's just a bunch of fuckin' noise\nThe way you talk about women is bullshit, plain bullshit\nWhat you motherfuckers doin' for the black community anyway?\nMotherfucker I got kids, I

beeping - R.I.P.*}\n Flatline\n Bullshit!\n\nWhy do I call myself a nigga you ask me?\nWell it's because motherfuckers wanna blast me\nAnd run me outta my neighborhood\nAnd label me as a dope dealer yo, and say that I'm no good\nBut I gave out jobs so niggas wouldn't have to go out\nGave em some dope and a corner so they could show out\nWhen the cops came, they gave a fake name\nBecause the life

One less bitch I gotta worry about\nBut that ain't how it turned out..\n\nYo, there was a bitch named her out and shot her\nStraight to the muthafuckin' trigger and said \"I got her!\"\nBut I had better plans to give her the blues\nLike dumpin' her in the river with cement shoes\nI knew my money was comin' up short\nAnd the thought that the stupid bitch thought she'd never get caught\nCame home early and straight bust her ass\nOn the couch with her other nigga countin' my cash\nI should've known she was like them other hoes\nI told the two motherfuckaz to take off their clothes\nButt naked, nothin' left but the shoes\nI had up a nine so they couldn't refuse\nI shot the nigga, he was outta there\nAnd tied up the bitch to the motherfuckin' chair\nNow there's one less bitch I gotta worry about\nEverybody out, that's how it turns out\n\nOne less\nOne less\nOne less bitch you gotta worry about!\n\nIn reality, a fool is one who believes that all women are ladies\nA nigga is one who believes that all ladies are bitches\nAnd all bitches are created equal\nTo me, all bitches are the same\nMoney-hungry, scandalous groupie hoes\nThat's always ridin' on a nigga's dick, always in a nigga's pocket\nAnd when the nigga runs out of money the bitch is gone in the wind\nTo me, ALL BITCHES AIN'T SHIT!\n\nOne less\nOne less\nOne less bitch you gotta worry about!", "image": "https://images.genius.com/378262f83025b434fc5375a332bd1a1f.800x800x1.png", "artist": "N.W.A", "raw": {"annotation_count": 26, "api_path": "/songs/35688", "description": {"dom": {"tag": "root", "children": [{"tag": "p", "children": ["Track 11 on N.W.A\u2019s final 1991 album ", {"tag": "em", "children": ["Niggaz4Life"]}, " (also known as ", {"tag": "em", "children": ["Efil4zaggin"]}, ") \u2013 \u201cOne Less Bitch\u201d \u2013 puts members MC Ren and Dr. Dre in the gritty streets of Compton, and both have serious dilemmas with women.

she said her husband was rich\nThen I knew I had the bitch\nYo she wrote a check, many a check\nIn the name of a bitch who was strugglin' at the same game\nAll I wanted to do was get P-A-I-D\nJust a little somethin' for fuckin' me\nYo Everything was cool but Vicky concerned me\nHer husband was the District Attorney\nSo, before he found out he was crossed up\nBy his bitch I was fuckin' I had her tossed up\nAnd put to sleep, so a nigga never forgets\nA dead bitch can't tell a nigga shit\nOne less bitch you gotta worry about\nShe's outta here and that's how it turned out\n\nOne less\nOne less\nOne less bitch you gotta worry about!\n\nThinkin' about money, and lookin' at a prostitute\nThe bitch was cute, so now I had to execute\nAnd shoot game like a real nigga\nWith a steel trigga\nConvince her to move up to somethin' bigga\nI think I had a flashback though\nCause I said \"fuck it\"\nLoped and choked and smoked to the ho' like this:\n\"Bitch, it's all about Dre\nThe money, money, money and this all I gotta say\"\nOf course she came with me and remained with me\n'Till the bitch felt lamed and ashamed to be\nWorkin' that trick shit\nCause niggas knew that she was short one\nA little later though she caught one\nIn the chest and I knew that it was commin'\nBy who and how the all act would be done?\nSo what? One less bitch I gotta worry about\nBut that ain't how it turned out..\n\nYo, there was a bitch named her out and shot her\nStraight to the muthafuckin' trigger and said \"I got her!\"\nBut I had better plans to give her the blues\nLike dumpin' her in the river with cement shoes\nI knew my money was comin' up short\nAnd the thought that the stupid bitch thought she'd never get caught\nCame home early and straight bust her ass\nOn the couch with her other nigga countin' my cash\nI should've known she was like them other hoes\nI told the two motherfuckaz to take off their clothes\nButt naked, nothin' left but the shoes\nI had up a nine so they couldn't refuse\nI shot the nigga, he was outta there\nAnd tied up the bitch to the motherfuckin' chair\nNow there's one less bitch I gotta worry about\nEverybody out, that's how it turns out\n\nOne less\nOne less\nOne less bitch you gotta worry about!\n\nIn reality, a fool is one who believes that all women are ladies\nA nigga is one who believes that all ladies are bitches\nAnd all bitches are created equal\nTo me, all bitches are the same\nMoney-hungry, scandalous groupie hoes\nThat's always ridin' on a nigga's dick, always in a nigga's pocket\nAnd when the nigga runs out of money the bitch is gone in the wind\nTo me, ALL BITCHES AIN'T SHIT!\n\nOne less\nOne less\nOne less bitch you gotta worry about!"}}, {"title": "Panic Zone", "album": "N.W.A.

your girl\n\nIt's called the panic zone (the panic zone)\nThat's right, the panic zone\nSome people call it torture\nBut it's what we call home\n(We are the renegades of this territory\nAnd you're the prey)\nI'm the Arabian Prince (and we're N.W.A.)\nDon't interfere with the sound you here\n'Cause it's a dangerous groove\nI'm in control of your mind and soul\nDon't be afraid, just bust a move\nSo far from home\nYou're on your own\nIn the land of the unknown\nIt's the darkside, the darkside\nIt's called the panic zone\n\nDo not attempt to adjust your radio\nThere is nothing wrong\nThe underworld is taking control\nYou're not only in dimension of sight and sound\nBut of mind\nThere's a sign post up ahead, and it reads\n\"The Panic Zone\"\n\nNow the party is at its peak\nSo we suggest you move your feet\nN.W.A. create the groove\nAnd Dr. Dre create the beat\nSo if you got the juice\nAnd you're feelin' loose\nLet the music take your mind\nThe freaks are here\nDon't interfere, our world is one of a kind\nThis place is called the west\nWest-Coast of the USA\nThe Panic Zone's home base\nIn a place we call L.A\nSo ladies, all the ladies\nIf you're all alone\nJust call Arabian Prince\nIn the panic zone (pa-pa-panic zone)\n\nA way out in here, a way out in here\nA way out in here, a way out in here\nA way out in here, a way out in here\nA way out in here, a way out in here\n\nIce Cube is from L.A\nHe is in the (Panic Zone, Pa-Panic Zone)\nEazy-E is from Compton\nHe is in the (Panic Zone, Pa-Panic Zone)\nArabian Prince from Inglewood\nHe is in the (Panic Zone, Pa-Panic Zone)\nDr. Dre is from Compton\nHe is in the (Panic Zone, Pa-Panic Zone)\nKrazy Dee is from East L.A\nHe is in the (Panic Zone, Pa-Panic Zone)\nRon-De-Vu is from Compton\nHe is in the

Aight!\n\nParental discretion is advised for the moment\nWhile I'm getting candid, now understand it\nAin't too typical in any way, though the pro\nOn the mic is the D.O. to the C., this is an intro\nI know The D.O.C. makes you want to take a Valium\nSo buy a bucket cause upcoming is my album\nAnd for the record, meaning my record, check it\nListen to the single and you'll be like, yo, I gotta get it\nBut in the meantime, listen to the rhyme\nOf the Dr. Dre played with N.W.A\nYella's on the drum roll, rocking the beat\nAiyyo Dre, where's you gonna take this shit man?\n\nAiyyo, let's take it to the street (WORD UP!)\nLet 'em understand perfection\nLet knowledge be the tool for suckers to stop guessing\nCause I don't give a fuck about radio play\nObserve the English I display\nLyrics for the adults, children have been barred\nAnd scarred from listening to something so motherfucking HARD\nDope, pumping that's so my shit will never falter\nYo it's Dre so fuck the \"Mind of Minolta\"\nPsycho like no other motherfucker\nSo step to me wrong, G-O for what you N-O\nBut be warned, never will I leave like a regular\nCause I'm a little better than the regular competitor\nI use to see 'em on stage\nEarning money like a thief, but without a gauge\nUntil I got full, of clocking the lame getting pull\n(They said you wasn't gon' get paid)\nNah that's bullshit! They like it stylistic\nAnd I enchant the crowd like I'm a mystic\n(C-C-C-C) C-C-C-cameras are flashing when I'm in action\nA photo, or fresh with a flair for fashion\nPure simplicity -- see, it's elementary\nYou hear one of the hardest motherfuckers this century\nTry to comprise a word to the wise and the guys\nParental discretion is advised\n\nRen is most extremely high performance\nThe black hat cause I worn this, cause it's like enormous\nSome shit I don't take it, not even in a toilet\nAnd shit from a sucker, put in a pot and I'll boil it\nTurn up the pilot as it burns\nAnd maybe the motherfuckers will learn\nI'm not a sub, cause I speak sensible\nNot considered a prince, cause I'm a principal\nI'm engineering the shit that you're hearing\nCause when it comes to power, I'm power steering\nSilly you say, I say you're silly when you say it\nRushing to the eject, to put my shit in and play it\nIt's like Apollo, but I'm not an amateur\nAnd I'm not giving a fuck while I'm damaging ya\nIt's for the record; so Ren's lyrics is gonna spin it\nAnd if there was a trophy involved, I'd win it\nPossession is mine and I'm the holder\nCause a nigga like Ren don't give a fuck cause I'm older\nSo for you to step off would be wise\nAnd say fuck it, parental discretion is advised\n\nI be what is known as a bandit\nYou gotta hand it to me when you truly understand it\nCause if you fail to see, read it in Braille\nIt'll still be funky -- so what's next is the flex\nOf a genius, my rapid-stutter-stepping if you seen this\nDope, you hope that I don't really mean this\nBut if Play made a greater high-top fade\nIt's not my trademark when I get loose in the dark\nYou guess it was a test of a different style\nIt's just another motherfucker on the pile\nDriving your ass with the flow of the tongue\nYou hung yourself shortly after knowledge was brung\nTo your attention, by the hardest motherfucking artist\nThat is known for lynching any sucker in a minute\nStagger 'em all\nWhen I start flowing like Niagara Falls\nIce Cube is equipped to rip shit in a battle\nMove like a snake when I'm mad; and then my tail rattle\nI get low on the flow so let your kids know\nWhen I bust, parental discretion is a must\n\nLittle did they know that I would be arriving\nAnd it's surprising, rocking it from where I been\nBut it's the E here to take, no mistake to be made\nIn the trade where funky ass records are being played\nFuck the regular, yo as I get better the\nBitches wanna trick and go stupid up on the dick\nSo I get 'em hot, thinking they're gonna get it\nAs they sit, rubbing their legs like a cricket\nTo you it may be funny, but\nThere's no service of beef without money\nSo slip the C-note, and you can choke\nOn a wing-ding-ding-a-ling down your throat\nForeplay to me ain't shit\nWhen you spread 'em I'm ready, then you can get the dick\nOf the Eaz, if you can deal with the size\nBut if you can't, parental discretion's advised!\n\nShut the fuck up!", "image": "https://images.genius.com/0ec6f769fde231f68fadfff699d2b94c.1000x1000x1.jpg", "artist": "N.W.A", "raw": {"annotation_count": 25, "api_path": "/songs/4276", "description": {"dom": {"tag": "root", "children": [{"tag": "p", "children": ["A massive, five-verse posse cut featuring all of the rapping members of N.W.A, including their behind-the-scenes lyricist, Tracy \u201cThe D.O.C.\u201d Curry, this song is one of the under-rated highlights of the group\u2019s seminal album ", {"tag": "em", "children": ["\u201cStraight Outta Compton\u201d"]}]}, "", {"tag": "p", "children": ["Although they never quite recaptured the magic, NWA later made two songs in the same vein: \u201c", {"tag": "a", "attributes": {"href": "https://genius.com/The-doc-the-grand-finale-lyrics"}, "data": {"api_path": "/songs/17596"}, "children": ["The Grand Finale"]}, "\u201d and \u201c", {"tag": "a", "attributes": {"href": "https://genius.com/Above-the-law-the-last-song-lyrics"}, "data": {"api_path": "/songs/7333"}, "children": ["The Last Song"]}, "\u201d.

CHARLES, TURN THE FUCKIN' CAMERA OFF, YOU MOTHAFUCKA... \n\nHahahahahahaha!"}}, {"title": "Quiet On Tha Set", "album": "Straight Outta Compton", "year": "1988-08-08", "lyrics": "Eazy-E: Yo Ren\nMC Ren:  What up?\nEazy-E: Take one\nMC Ren: Yo\nEazy-E: Hit it\n\nRuthless, plenty of that and much more\nSo at the party, Ren is controllin the floor\nThat you step and do your dance routine\nIt ain't a dream my man, you're in a gangsta scene\nWith a villain doin damage on a 24 track\nWith no confusion to finish my conclusion\nRythymatic rhymes from a radio cat\nYou can't take what I got coz I'll be takin it right back\nRuthless gangsta - Cold killin\nYou wanna know what it's means? - Definition villain\nWith the stupid dope rhyme\nSo once you hear one line you can tell it's mine\nWith a baseball cap that's black that I'm wearin\nAnd a look that keeps you all starin\nAnd wondering why I'm invincible\nBut when you hear my rhyme, it's convincible\nI don't take no shorts while I'm constructing the ground\nThat makes y'all move around to my hell of a sound\nGirls drool on me like a diamond\n(Yo Ren, tell them what they do when you start rhymin)\nI go to the party, I hip, I hop the spot\nI dunno what it is, but the girls get hot\nPerspirin' like they're on fire and\nTheir so-called boyfriends with'em are retirin\nAnd for this reason I'm a walkin threat\nSo when I'm on stage I want quiet on tha set\n\"Light, camera, action\" (N.W.A. take two)\n\nNow to get started with my musical profession\nA gangsta or villain in mine is in session\nThe way that I'm referrin' to this makes ya move ya butt\nBut don't stand in a daze, yeah you should know what's up\nAnyway I keep em clappin' along\nCoz' nothing bad could go wrong because this song is so strong\nI'm like Toyota, who could ask for anything more\nWhen N.W.A. is cold rockin' the floor\nLike stupid, actin like a retard\nWaitin' for a bumrush, gettin' to the good part\nIt tempts me so with temptation\nWritin' my lyrics with this hyped information\nThis is a section of my creation\nSo don't say shhh! with an exclamation\nJust look at the center of the stage where the spotlight shines\n(Boy you should have known by now) It's mine!\nUnpredictable, keepin you extremely enjoyed\nIt's irresistable, meaning that you can't avoid\nAnd while I'm on stage, look forward to sweat\nBut after I rip it up I want quiet on tha' set\n\"Light, camera, action\" (N.W.A. take three)\n\nI can be loud as hell, think I will? Never\nQuiet on tha' set - Yeah I like that better\nCause what I can do I think I earn respect\nAnd if I didn't from you, that's what I expect\nCause if it ain't ruff it ain't me\nSo who really cares how you want me to be\nSee, I'm just mean staying at the top of the pile\nAnd doin' soft note tunes it ain't my style\nAnd this concludes our program\nOf how N.W.A. makes a ruthless jam\nNow first we take an average drum\nGive it to Dre, and the boy gets dumb\nIt's no secret, that I sit alone at night\nPick up a pad and pen and begin to write\nAll kinda lyrics that's promised to play\nTo make everybody say\n\n\"They can be cold and ruthless no question about that\nBut sometimes it's more complicated\"\n(Yo Dre)\n(You know what I want you to do?)\n(Bring that beat back, bring that beat back)\n\nNow MC Ren is here working like super glue\nNo matter what I do, I'm gonna stick it to you\nCause I'm the pusher, supplying the fix\nAnd this jam's so dope, it don't need a remix\nBut I'm making obstacles of enemy traps\nTo catch any MC's with the weakest raps\nCrucifyin in vain like just for usin my name\nThe definition is pain, but that's the thing o' the game\nIf they try to retreat, I catch'em one at a time\nCoz they're comittin a crime, and still promotin a rhyme\nSo, you in the back of me just listen and learn\nBecause you'll all get a chance or maybe a turn\nNow my assignment was to give a preview\nSo at my next concert I wanna see you there\nNot sittin in a chair standin on both feet, with yo hand in the air\nNow I'm about to jet out but I'll be back\nBut next time expect a more funkier track\nDeep down for your enjoyment to hear more percussion\nWith lyrics that's smooth to start some discussion\nThe prove that I'm hype and you know that's bet\nNow continue to dance coz I'm thru with tha set", "image": "https://i.genius.com/738cee88d3e4e09c1b8c24de5357c799a275acdd?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimg.discogs.com%2FmOi4U4YtlG2R7bTARf7D4UC8thY%3D%2Ffit-in%2F600x584%2Ffilters%3Astrip_icc%28%29%3Aformat%28jpeg%29%3Amode_rgb%28%29%3Aquality%2890%29%2Fdiscogs-images%2FR-704115-1474940376-6559.jpeg.jpg", "artist": "N.W.A", "raw": {"annotation_count": 24, "api_path": "/songs/35714", "description": {"dom": {"tag": "root", "children": [{"tag": "p", "children": ["Ren\u2019s second solo track on the album.

"Eazy-E: Yo Ren\nMC Ren:  What up?\nEazy-E: Take one\nMC Ren: Yo\nEazy-E: Hit it\n\nRuthless, plenty of that and much more\nSo at the party, Ren is controllin the floor\nThat you step and do your dance routine\nIt ain't a dream my man, you're in a gangsta scene\nWith a villain doin damage on a 24 track\nWith no confusion to finish my conclusion\nRythymatic rhymes from a radio cat\nYou can't take what I got coz I'll be takin it right back\nRuthless gangsta - Cold killin\nYou wanna know what it's means? - Definition villain\nWith the stupid dope rhyme\nSo once you hear one line you can tell it's mine\nWith a baseball cap that's black that I'm wearin\nAnd a look that keeps you all starin\nAnd wondering why I'm invincible\nBut when you hear my rhyme, it's convincible\nI don't take no shorts while I'm constructing the ground\nThat makes y'all move around to my hell of a sound\nGirls drool on me like a diamond\n(Yo Ren, tell them what they do when you start rhymin)\nI go to the party, I hip, I hop the spot\nI dunno what it is, but the girls get hot\nPerspirin' like they're on fire and\nTheir so-called boyfriends with'em are retirin\nAnd for this reason I'm a walkin threat\nSo when I'm on stage I want quiet on tha set\n\"Light, camera, action\" (N.W.A. take two)\n\nNow to get started with my musical profession\nA gangsta or villain in mine is in session\nThe way that I'm referrin' to this makes ya move ya butt\nBut don't stand in a daze, yeah you should know what's up\nAnyway I keep em clappin' along\nCoz' nothing bad could go wrong because this song is so strong\nI'm like Toyota, who could ask for anything more\nWhen N.W.A. is cold rockin' the floor\nLike stupid, actin like a retard\nWaitin' for a bumrush, gettin' to the good part\nIt tempts me so with temptation\nWritin' my lyrics with this hyped information\nThis is a section of my creation\nSo don't say shhh! with an exclamation\nJust look at the center of the stage where the spotlight shines\n(Boy you should have known by now) It's mine!\nUnpredictable, keepin you extremely enjoyed\nIt's irresistable, meaning that you can't avoid\nAnd while I'm on stage, look forward to sweat\nBut after I rip it up I want quiet on tha' set\n\"Light, camera, action\" (N.W.A. take three)\n\nI can be loud as hell, think I will? Never\nQuiet on tha' set - Yeah I like that better\nCause what I can do I think I earn respect\nAnd if I didn't from you, that's what I expect\nCause if it ain't ruff it ain't me\nSo who really cares how you want me to be\nSee, I'm just mean staying at the top of the pile\nAnd doin' soft note tunes it ain't my style\nAnd this concludes our program\nOf how N.W.A. makes a ruthless jam\nNow first we take an average drum\nGive it to Dre, and the boy gets dumb\nIt's no secret, that I sit alone at night\nPick up a pad and pen and begin to write\nAll kinda lyrics that's promised to play\nTo make everybody say\n\n\"They can be cold and ruthless no question about that\nBut sometimes it's more complicated\"\n(Yo Dre)\n(You know what I want you to do?)\n(Bring that beat back, bring that beat back)\n\nNow MC Ren is here working like super glue\nNo matter what I do, I'm gonna stick it to you\nCause I'm the pusher, supplying the fix\nAnd this jam's so dope, it don't need a remix\nBut I'm making obstacles of enemy traps\nTo catch any MC's with the weakest raps\nCrucifyin in vain like just for usin my name\nThe definition is pain, but that's the thing o' the game\nIf they try to retreat, I catch'em one at a time\nCoz they're comittin a crime, and still promotin a rhyme\nSo, you in the back of me just listen and learn\nBecause you'll all get a chance or maybe a turn\nNow my assignment was to give a preview\nSo at my next concert I wanna see you there\nNot sittin in a chair standin on both feet, with yo hand in the air\nNow I'm about to jet out but I'll be back\nBut next time expect a more funkier track\nDeep down for your enjoyment to hear more percussion\nWith lyrics that's smooth to start some discussion\nThe prove that I'm hype and you know that's bet\nNow continue to dance coz I'm thru with tha set"}}, {"title": "Real Niggaz", "album": "100 Miles and Runnin'", "year": "1990-08-14", "lyrics": "Yo, what\u2019s up niggas and niggettes?\nN.W.A is back in

finished, tell \u2018em what\u2019s up man\nYo man, there\u2019s a gang of motherfuckers out there on the dick, man\nIn every motherfuckin' state\nWanna be like, wanna look like, wanna act like\nWanna dress like, wanna sound like muthafuckin' style stealin'\nClone ass N.W.A bitin' ass motherfuckin' everywhere man\nNon-reality seein', non-reality feelin'\nNon-reality livin' ass motherfuckers man\nHey, I don\u2019t know, reality, it\u2019s important to me, man\nSo fellas man, tell these niggas what it\u2019s like in the minds of real niggas\n\nPrisoner like a hostage\nYo, you should of covered your muthafucking head like an ostrich\nDeep in the dirt cause you's a sucker\nAnd you ass up high so I can kick the muthafucker\nDon\u2019t try to hang, you best avoid\nCause my foot will be so far up your ass you\u2019ll get hemorrhoids\nBefore you try to fuck wit Ren\nI'll put two in your ass and you'll be shitting a size 10\n\nFirst come, first serve, whoever's got the nerve\nStep up and get what you deserve\nFrom the word of a muthafucking hip-hop maniac\nBrainiac, so what you oughta do is step the fuck back\nNow how the fuck you think a rap will last?\nWit your ass saying shit that is said in the past\nYo, be original, your shit is sloppy\nGet off the dick you muthafucking carbon copy\n\nFalling deep in the drums so many of styles\nIs one of the reasons a nigga ran a hundred miles\nCheating and now beating, the crowd I kept seating\nBut weak muthafuckas biting off and they kept eating\nStyles that kept them full of bull\nCause the vocals were local in nightclubs and not getting paid in full\nThey got the nerve to cuss\nOnly reason niggas pick up your record is cause they thought it was us\n\nYo, giving what I gotta give, doing what I gotta do\nYou don't care for me, so who gives a fuck about you\nYou can't harm me, alarm me\nCause we're the generals in this fucking hip-hop army\nThe niggas wit attitudes if you didn't know\nWe blow, flow and getting loose slow from the get go, yo\nTry us and take it\nYo, fuck this shit, Yella, kick the break in\n\nIt's the real thing, you are now real, real niggas, niggas\n\nYou can run, but you can\u2019t hide, you know I'mma find'cha\nCause a nigga like Ren's only 2 steps behind'cha\nDon\u2019t look back because you\u2019re shaking and all scared\nA nigga in black can be your scariest nightmare\nSo sleep wit the lights on, forget that the mic's on\nDon't step on my muthafucking stage without nike's on\nDon\u2019t say it\u2019s psycho and then you just might go\nMentally fucked up when I let the right blow\n\nAll these niggas wit the jibber jabber\nBut couldn't kill a fly wit a muthafucking sledge hammer\nGangstas in black are out there\nBut only because, yo, it\u2019s the shit that we wear\nOn my muthafucking dick\nBut I'mma love it when you drop like a muthafucking brick\nSo, yo, step off, go to bed, cause if you're mislead\nYou get a muthafucking bullet in your forehead\n\nBlack, the good, the bad, the ugly, you see\nA little streetwise nigga, you know me\nRolling wit some real niggas playing for keeps\nBut you muthafuckas know who run the streets\nWit that hardcore hip-hop rap shit\nNow how much harder can another nigga get?\nTrying to be like us, sound like us, dress like us\nAshes to ashes and dust to dust\nSo nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, please\nSince you're on the dick why don't you drop to your knees\nCause I'm a muthafucka that's out to kill\nEazy-E, a nigga that's real\n\nReal niggas, straight off the streets of Compton\nQuick to get in your shit without second thought\nAnd if your ass get smoked, it's my bullet you caught\nSo if you're talking shit about the niggas in black\nBow down to the Kings in Raider hats\n\nThey played out, that's what niggas were chanting\nOne nigga left and they said we ain't happening\nPeople had thought we was finished and then done wit\nBut if you think about it, yo, we really ain't done shit\nYet, so cover your ears and wipe your tears\nAnd quit sniffing all over my dick for new ideas\nAnd when the new record comes, I\u2019ll come like a fucking bomb\nAsking for fucking money, don't buy you a fucking crumb\nYou're on the dicks of four niggas not one\nAnd when it comes to dicks, you don't even have one\nSo brace yourself to make sure you don't get fucked up\nCause if I let you slide, it\u2019s just cause you lucked up\nDon\u2019t come in my face again, because I'mma floor ya\nAnd if you're a bitch, I'm a fucking ignore ya\nBecause my attitude's a little bigga\nCause MC Ren is one of the real niggas\n\nLost in a muthafucking world of madness\nSadness, but Dre is just a nigga that gladdest\nSucking muthafuckas like you, making wack jams\nBecause it only shows you how dope I am\nNever try to ignore us\nWhen I'm expressing, stand still like you're full of rigor mortis\nCause I'm a real nigga, but I guess you figure\nYou can break me, take me, but watch me pull the trigger\nDre is just a nigga with heart, a nigga that\u2019s smart\nA nigga that\u2019s paid to say what others are scared to play\nWe started out wit too much cargo\nSo I'm glad we got rid of Benedict Arnold\nYo, N.W.A, criticize for what we say\nBut I'm a do the shit anyway\nCause I'm the muthafucking doctor, never faking\nYo, Yella, kick the muthafucking break in\n\nN.W.A, straight outta muthafucking Compton\nTaking over shit in all of the 1990's\nYo, Dr. Dre, DJ Yella, Eazy-E\nAnd I am MC Ren, yo, N.W.A taking over this muthafucka y'all", "image":

"Yo, what\u2019s up niggas and niggettes?\nN.W.A is back in this motherfucker\nAnd this is only the single\nWait until the motherfucking album comes out\nWe gone have some more of that good shit\nThe shit you just can\u2019t fuck with\nBut yo, we ain\u2019t finished, tell \u2018em what\u2019s up man\nYo man, there\u2019s a gang of motherfuckers out there on the dick, man\nIn every motherfuckin' state\nWanna be like, wanna look like, wanna act like\nWanna dress like, wanna sound like muthafuckin' style stealin'\nClone ass N.W.A bitin' ass motherfuckin' everywhere man\nNon-reality seein', non-reality feelin'\nNon-reality livin' ass motherfuckers man\nHey, I don\u2019t know, reality, it\u2019s important to me, man\nSo fellas man, tell these niggas what it\u2019s like in the minds of real niggas\n\nPrisoner like a hostage\nYo, you should of covered your muthafucking head like an ostrich\nDeep in the dirt cause you's a sucker\nAnd you ass up high so I can kick the muthafucker\nDon\u2019t try to hang, you best avoid\nCause my foot will be so far up your ass you\u2019ll get hemorrhoids\nBefore you try to fuck wit Ren\nI'll put two in your ass and you'll be shitting a size 10\n\nFirst come, first serve, whoever's got the nerve\nStep up and get what you deserve\nFrom the word of a muthafucking hip-hop maniac\nBrainiac, so what you oughta do is step the fuck back\nNow how the fuck you think a rap will last?\nWit your ass saying shit that is said in the past\nYo, be original, your shit is sloppy\nGet off the dick you muthafucking carbon copy\n\nFalling deep in the drums so many of styles\nIs one of the reasons a nigga ran a hundred miles\nCheating and now beating, the crowd I kept seating\nBut weak muthafuckas biting off and they kept eating\nStyles that kept them full of bull\nCause the vocals were local in nightclubs and not getting paid in full\nThey got the nerve to cuss\nOnly reason niggas pick up your record is cause they thought it was us\n\nYo, giving what I gotta give, doing what I gotta do\nYou don't care for me, so who gives a fuck about you\nYou can't harm me, alarm me\nCause we're the generals in this fucking hip-hop army\nThe niggas wit attitudes if you didn't know\nWe blow, flow and getting loose slow from the get go, yo\nTry us and take it\nYo, fuck this shit, Yella, kick the break in\n\nIt's the real thing, you are now real, real niggas, niggas\n\nYou can run, but you can\u2019t hide, you know I'mma find'cha\nCause a nigga like Ren's only 2 steps behind'cha\nDon\u2019t look back because you\u2019re shaking and all scared\nA nigga in black can be your scariest nightmare\nSo sleep wit the lights on, forget that the mic's on\nDon't step on my muthafucking stage without nike's on\nDon\u2019t say it\u2019s psycho and then you just might go\nMentally fucked up when I let the right blow\n\nAll these niggas wit the jibber jabber\nBut couldn't kill a fly wit a muthafucking sledge hammer\nGangstas in black are out there\nBut only because, yo, it\u2019s the shit that we wear\nOn my muthafucking dick\nBut I'mma love it when you drop like a muthafucking brick\nSo, yo, step off, go to bed, cause if you're mislead\nYou get a muthafucking bullet in your forehead\n\nBlack, the good, the bad, the ugly, you see\nA little streetwise nigga, you know me\nRolling wit some real niggas playing for keeps\nBut you muthafuckas know who run the streets\nWit that hardcore hip-hop rap shit\nNow how much harder can another nigga get?\nTrying to be like us, sound like us, dress like us\nAshes to ashes and dust to dust\nSo nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, please\nSince you're on the dick why don't you drop to your knees\nCause I'm a muthafucka that's out to kill\nEazy-E, a nigga that's real\n\nReal niggas, straight off the streets of Compton\nQuick to get in your shit without second thought\nAnd if your ass get smoked, it's my bullet you caught\nSo if you're talking shit about the niggas in black\nBow down to the Kings in Raider hats\n\nThey played out, that's what niggas were chanting\nOne nigga left and they said we ain't happening\nPeople had thought we was finished and then done wit\nBut if you think about it, yo, we really ain't done shit\nYet, so cover your ears and wipe your tears\nAnd quit sniffing all over my dick for new ideas\nAnd when the new record comes, I\u2019ll come like a fucking bomb\nAsking for fucking money, don't buy you a fucking crumb\nYou're on the dicks of four niggas not one\nAnd when it comes to dicks, you don't even have one\nSo brace yourself to make sure you don't get fucked up\nCause if I let you slide, it\u2019s just cause you lucked up\nDon\u2019t come in my face again, because I'mma floor ya\nAnd if you're a bitch, I'm a fucking ignore ya\nBecause my attitude's a little bigga\nCause MC Ren is one of the real niggas\n\nLost in a muthafucking world of madness\nSadness, but Dre is just a nigga that gladdest\nSucking muthafuckas like you, making wack jams\nBecause it only shows you how dope I am\nNever try to ignore us\nWhen I'm expressing, stand still like you're full of rigor mortis\nCause I'm a real nigga, but I guess you figure\nYou can break me, take me, but watch me pull the trigger\nDre is just a nigga with heart, a nigga that\u2019s smart\nA nigga that\u2019s paid to say what others are scared to play\nWe started out wit too much cargo\nSo I'm glad we got rid of Benedict Arnold\nYo, N.W.A, criticize for what we say\nBut I'm a do the shit anyway\nCause I'm the muthafucking doctor, never faking\nYo, Yella, kick the muthafucking break in\n\nN.W.A, straight outta muthafucking Compton\nTaking over shit in all of the 1990's\nYo, Dr. Dre, DJ Yella, Eazy-E\nAnd I am MC Ren, yo, N.W.A taking over this muthafucka y'all"}}, {"title": "Real Niggaz Don't Die", "album": "Niggaz4Life", "year": "1991-05-28", "lyrics": "Die nigga! We are born to die nigga\nYou've been dyin for 400 years\nNiggas know how to die\nNiggas don't know nothin else, but dying\nNiggas dream about dying\n\nI'm a motherfuckin nigga  (with an attitude)\nI'm a motherfuckin nigga  (with an attitude)\nI'm a motherfuckin nigga  (with an attitude)\nI'm a motherfuckin nigga  (with an attitude)\n\nI got a case, of spittin in a motherfucker's face\nSo me and my ace, we got a taste\nOf a motherfucker's billy club, he took his gun and\nPut it to my head and said, \"Nigga start runnin\"\nSo tell me what's the next episode?\nIs he crazy, does he want to chase me or waste me?\nI thought, \"Run nigga run\", but I caught myself\nBecause my secondary thought was death\nI've got head and heart real, but still a motherfucker said\n\"I want another black motherfucker dead\nNiggas ain't good for shit to me\"\nCause it's a race for second class, so get your ass\nUp against the wall bitch, and then he tried\nTo jump me but the punk became a victim of a walkby\nFuckin with Dre, you get a foot up in your asshole\nIt's just another way to let you know\nNigga send them, nigga send them, nigga send them\nPunk can't fuck with me - Real motherfucking G\nStraight from the streets of the CPT\nTelling you why, real niggas don't die\n\n\"I-iiiiiii, just want to celebrate!\"\n\nReal niggas don't die cause they eventually multiply\nThe niggas I'm with, they take an eye for an eye\nBecause the times are so wrong, gotta stay so strong\nNiggas gotta keep it goin on and on\nAnd don't let no paleface throw your ass in a snail race\nHave your residence occupyin a jail space\nThat's what they want to do cause the system is fucked around\nI try to let you know with the records that's underground\nThey don't give a fuck about a nigga, they would rather pull the trigger\nAnd have you in front of a barrel smilin sayin \"Cheese!\"\nSo nigga get smart and rebel back\nI'm not with that black shit so I'm not gonna yell that\nAll I see is niggas getting harassed\nAnd can't do nothin about it but get a foot in they ass, yo\nBut if every nigga grabbed a nine\nAnd started shootin motherfuckers it would put 'em in line\nAnd that's how it's supposed to be\nWhen a pussy-ass nigga try to fuck with me\nYo, because it's useless to try\nTo kill a nigga cause nigga a motherfuckin real nigga don't die!\n\n\"I-iiiiiii, just want to celebrate!\"\n\nDie nigga, everywhere you go\nNiggas dying, niggas been dyin for 400 years\n\nI'm a motherfuckin nigga  (with an attitude)\n\nOnly the good die young, so that makes me young and bad\nPuttin ass-kickings on the niggas that never had\nSo I guess that makes me tough shit\nStraight up gangsta, wrong nigga to fuck with\nSo how can a nigga die, when he's causin the bloodshed\nBy shoot motherfuckers in the head\nTryin to make a nigga extinct because they fear me\nBut never wanna hear me\nSo I'mma let 'em know how a nigga's livin\nTakin from motherfuckers cause nobody ain't givin\nA damn thang! To a nigga, a real nigga\nSo I'm living by the motherfuckin trigger\nCause a nigga ain't afraid of bein locked up\nI'm out of luck, so why should I give a fuck?\nBut they still want to try\nTo kill a nigga like me but motherfuckin real niggas don't die!\n\n\"I-iiiiiii, just want to celebrate!\"\n\nYeah, a real nigga don't die!\nYeah motherfuckers!\n(\"Die, nigga!\")", "image":

To a nigga, a real nigga\nSo I'm living by the motherfuckin trigger\nCause a nigga ain't afraid of bein locked up\nI'm out of luck, so why should I give a fuck?\nBut they still want to try\nTo kill a

Version)", "album": "Niggaz4Life", "year": "1991-05-28", "lyrics": "Prisoner like a hostage\nYo, you should've covered your muthafucking head like an ostrich\nDeep in the dirt cause you's a sucker\nBend ya ass up high so I can kick the muthafucker\nDon't try to hang, you best avoid\nCause my foot will be so far up you ass, you'll get hemorrhoids\nBefore you try to fuck wit Ren\nI'll put two in your ass and you'll be shitting a size 10\n\nFirst come, first serve, whoever's got the nerve\nStep up and get what you deserve\nFrom the word of a muthafucking hip-hop maniac\nBrainiac, so what you oughta do is step the fuck back\nNow how the fuck you think that rap would last\nWit your ass saying shit that is said in the past\nYo, be original, your shit is sloppy\nGet off the dick you muthafucking carbon copy\n\nFalling deep in the drums of so many of styles\nIs one of the reasons a nigga ran a hundred miles\nCheating and not beating, the crowd I kept seating\nBut weak muthafuckas biting off and they kept eating\nStyles that kept them full of bull\nCause the vocals were local in nightclubs and not getting paid in full\nThey got the nerve to cuss\nOnly reason niggas pick up your record is cause they thought it was us\n\nYo, giving what I gotta give, doing what I gotta do\nYou don't care for me, so who gives a fuck about you\nYou can't harm me, alarm me\nCause we're the generals in this fucking hip-hop army\nThe niggas wit attitudes if you didn't know\nWe blow, flow and getting loose slow from the get go, yo\nTitles are takin'\nYo, fuck this shit, Yella, kick the break in\n\nIt's the real thing\nYou are now\nReal, real niggas, niggas\n\nYou can run but you can't hide, you know I'm a find ya\nCause a nigga like Ren's only two steps behind ya\nDon't look back, cause you're shaking and all scared\nA nigga in black can be your scariest nightmare\nSo sleep wit the lights on, forget that the mic's on\nDon't step on my muthafucking stage without Nike's on\nDon't say it's psycho and then you just might go\nMentally fucked up when I let the right blow\n\nAll these niggas with the jibber jabber\nBut couldn't kill a fly wit a muthafucking sledge hammer\nGangstas in black are out there\nBut only because, yo, it's the shit we wear\nOn my muthafucking dick\nBut I'm a love it when you drop like a muthafucking brick\nSo, yo, step off, go to bed, cause if you're mislead\nYou get a muthafucking bullet in your forehead\n\nBack, the good, the bad, the ugly, you see\nA little streetwise nigga, you know me\nRolling wit some real niggas playing for keeps\nBut you muthafuckas know who run the streets\nWith that hardcore hip-hop rap shit\nNow how much harder can another nigga get?\nTrying to be like us, sound like us, dress like us\nAshes to ashes and dust to dust\nSo nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, please\nSince you're on the dick why don't you drop to your knees\nCause I'm a muthafucka that's out to kill\nEazy-E, a nigga that's real\n\nReal niggas, straight off the streets of Compton\nQuick to get in your shit without second thought\nAnd if your ass get smoked, it's my bullet you caught\nSo if you're talking shit about the niggas in black\nBow down to the Kings in Raider hats\n\nThey played out, that's what niggas were chanting\nOne nigga left and they said we ain't have in it\nPeople had thought we was finished and then done wit\nBut if you think about it, yo, we really ain't done shit\nYet, so cover your ears and wipe your tears\nAnd quit sniffing all over my dick for new ideas\nAnd when the new record come, I'll come like a fucking bomb\nAsking for fucking money, don't buy you a fucking crumb\nYou're on the dicks of four niggas not one\nAnd when it comes to dicks, you don't even have one\nSo brace yourself to make sure you don't get fucked up\nBecause if I let you slide, it's just cause you lucked up\nDon't come in my face again, because I'm a floor ya\nAnd if you're a bitch, I'm a fucking ignore ya\nBecause my attitude's a little bigga\nCause MC Ren is one of the real niggas\n\nLost in a muthafucking world of madness\nSadness, but Dre is just a nigga that glad its\nSucking muthafuckas like you, making wack jams\nBecause it only shows you how dope I am\nNever try to ignore us\nWhen I'm expressing, stand still like you're full of rigor mortis\nCause I'm a real nigga, but I guess you figure\nYou can break me, take me, but watch me pull the trigger\nDre is just a nigga with heart, a nigga that's smart\nA nigga that's paid to say what others are scared to play\nWe started out wit too much cargo\nSo I'm glad we got rid of Benedict Arnold\nYo, N.W.A - criticized for what we say\nBut I'm a do this shit anyway\nCause I'm the muthafucking doctor, never faking\nYo, Yella, kick the muthafucking break in\n\nIt's the real thing\nYou are now\nReal, real niggas, niggas\nYeah, motherfucker, it's the real thing\nYou are now\nReal, real niggas, niggas\n\nN.W.A, straight outta muthafucking Compton\nTaking over shit in all of the 1990's\nYo, Dr. Dre, DJ Yella, Eazy-E\nAnd I am MC Ren, yo, N.W.A taking over this muthafucka y'all", "image":

in the dirt cause you's a sucker\nBend ya ass up high so I can kick the muthafucker\nDon't try to hang, you best avoid\nCause my foot will be so far up you ass, you'll get hemorrhoids\nBefore you try to fuck wit Ren\nI'll put two in your ass and you'll be shitting a size 10\n\nFirst come, first serve, whoever's got the nerve\nStep up and get what you deserve\nFrom the word of a muthafucking hip-hop maniac\nBrainiac, so what you oughta do is step the fuck back\nNow how the fuck you think that rap would last\nWit your ass saying shit that is said in the past\nYo, be original, your shit is sloppy\nGet off the dick you muthafucking carbon copy\n\nFalling deep in the drums of so many of styles\nIs one of the reasons a nigga ran a hundred miles\nCheating and not beating, the crowd I kept seating\nBut weak muthafuckas biting off and they kept eating\nStyles that kept them full of bull\nCause the vocals were local in nightclubs and not getting paid in full\nThey got the nerve to cuss\nOnly reason niggas pick up your record is cause they thought it was us\n\nYo, giving what I gotta give, doing what I gotta do\nYou don't care for me, so who gives a fuck about you\nYou can't harm me, alarm me\nCause we're the generals in this fucking hip-hop army\nThe niggas wit attitudes if you didn't know\nWe blow, flow and getting loose slow from the get go, yo\nTitles are takin'\nYo, fuck this shit, Yella, kick the break in\n\nIt's the real thing\nYou are now\nReal, real niggas, niggas\n\nYou can run but you can't hide, you know I'm a find ya\nCause a nigga like Ren's only two steps behind ya\nDon't look back, cause you're shaking and all scared\nA nigga in black can be your scariest nightmare\nSo sleep wit the lights on, forget that the mic's on\nDon't step on my muthafucking stage without Nike's on\nDon't say it's psycho and then you just might go\nMentally fucked up when I let the right blow\n\nAll these niggas with the jibber jabber\nBut couldn't kill a fly wit a muthafucking sledge hammer\nGangstas in black are out there\nBut only because, yo, it's the shit we wear\nOn my muthafucking dick\nBut I'm a love it when you drop like a muthafucking brick\nSo, yo, step off, go to bed, cause if you're mislead\nYou get a muthafucking bullet in your forehead\n\nBack, the good, the bad, the ugly, you see\nA little streetwise nigga, you know me\nRolling wit some real niggas playing for keeps\nBut you muthafuckas know who run the streets\nWith that hardcore hip-hop rap shit\nNow how much harder can another nigga get?\nTrying to be like us, sound like us, dress like us\nAshes to ashes and dust to dust\nSo nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, please\nSince you're on the dick why don't you drop to your knees\nCause I'm a muthafucka that's out to kill\nEazy-E, a nigga that's real\n\nReal niggas, straight off the streets of Compton\nQuick to get in your shit without second thought\nAnd if your ass get smoked, it's my bullet you caught\nSo if you're talking shit about the niggas in black\nBow down to the Kings in Raider hats\n\nThey played out, that's what niggas were chanting\nOne nigga left and they said we ain't have in it\nPeople had thought we was finished and then done wit\nBut if you think about it, yo, we really ain't done shit\nYet, so cover your ears and wipe your tears\nAnd quit sniffing all over my dick for new ideas\nAnd when the new record come, I'll come like a fucking bomb\nAsking for fucking money, don't buy you a fucking crumb\nYou're on the dicks of four niggas not one\nAnd when it comes to dicks, you don't even have one\nSo brace yourself to make sure you don't get fucked up\nBecause if I let you slide, it's just cause you lucked up\nDon't come in my face again, because I'm a floor ya\nAnd if you're a bitch, I'm a fucking ignore ya\nBecause my attitude's a little bigga\nCause MC Ren is one of the real niggas\n\nLost in a muthafucking world of madness\nSadness, but Dre is just a nigga that glad its\nSucking muthafuckas like you, making wack jams\nBecause it only shows you how dope I am\nNever try to ignore us\nWhen I'm expressing, stand still like you're full of rigor mortis\nCause I'm a real nigga, but I guess you figure\nYou can break me, take me, but watch me pull the trigger\nDre is just a nigga with heart, a nigga that's smart\nA nigga that's paid to say what others are scared to play\nWe started out wit too much cargo\nSo I'm glad we got rid of Benedict Arnold\nYo, N.W.A - criticized for what we say\nBut I'm a do this shit anyway\nCause I'm the muthafucking doctor, never faking\nYo, Yella, kick the muthafucking break in\n\nIt's the real thing\nYou are now\nReal, real niggas, niggas\nYeah, motherfucker, it's the real thing\nYou are now\nReal, real niggas, niggas\n\nN.W.A, straight outta muthafucking Compton\nTaking over shit in all of the 1990's\nYo, Dr. Dre, DJ Yella, Eazy-E\nAnd I am MC Ren, yo, N.W.A taking over this muthafucka y'all"}}, {"title":

started!!\nWe don't know how it got started\nFuck that question, you know what I'm saying?\nIt's the same bullshit over and over\nHow did we get started?\nHow did we first meet?\n\nPrisoner like a hostage\nYo, you should've covered your motherfucking head like an ostrich\nDeep in the dirt cause you was a sucker\nAnd your ass up high so I can kick the motherfucker\nDon't try to hang, you best avoid it\nCause my foot will be so far up your ass, you'll get hemrroids\nBefore you try to fuck with Ren\nI'll put two in your ass and you'll be shitting the size 10\n\nFirst come, first serve, whoever's got the nerve\nStep up and get what you deserve\nFrom the world of the motherfucking Hip-Hop maniac\nBrainiac, so what you ought to do is step the fuck back\nBut how the fuck you think your rap would last?\nWith your ass saying shit that is said in the past\nYo, be original, your shit is sloppy\nGet off the dick, you motherfucking carbon copy\n\nFalling deep in the drums for many of styles\nIs one of the reasons a nigga ran the hundred miles\nCheating and not beating, the crowd are kept seating\nBut weak motherfuckers biting off and they kept eating\nStyles that kept them full of bull\nCause the vocals were local in nightclubs and not getting paid in full\nAnd got the nerve to cuss\nOnly reason niggas pick up your record is cause they thought it was us\n\nYo, giving what I gotta give, doing what I gotta do\nYou don't care for me, so who gives a fuck about you?\nYou can't harm me, alarm me\nCause we're the generals in this fucking Hip-Hop army\nThe niggas with attitudes, if you didn't know\nWe blow, flow and then move slow from the get Go\nYo, tie us to take it\nYo, fuck this shit, Yella, kick the break in\n\nIt's the real thing\nYou are now   ----] Dr. Dre\nReal, real niggas, niggas\n\nYou can run but you can't hide, you know I'm a find you\nCause a nigga like Ren, is only two steps behind you\nDon't look back, because you're shaking and all scared\nA nigga in black, can be your scariest nightmare\nSo sleep with the lights on, forget that the Mic's on\nDon't step on my motherfucking stage without Nike's on\nDon't say it's psycho, and then you just might go\nMentally fucked up, when I let the right blow\n\nAll these niggas with the gibber gabber\nBut couldn't kill a fly with a motherfucking sledge hammer\nGangsters in black are out there\nBut only because, yo, it's the shit that we wear\nOn my motherfucking dick\nBut I'ma love it when you drop like a motherfucking brick\nSo, yo, step off, go to bed, cause if you're mislead\nYou'll get a motherfucking bullet in your forehead\n\nBlack, the good, the bad, the ugly, you see\nA little street wise nigga, you know me\nRolling with some real niggas playing for keeps\nBut you motherfuckers know who run the streets\nWith that hardcore Hip-Hop rap shit\n Now how much harder can another nigga get?\nTrying to be like us, sound like us, dress like us\n Ashes to ashes and dust to dust\nSo nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, please\nSince you're on the dick, why don't you drop to your knees?\nCause I'm the motherfucker that's out to kill\nEazy-E, a nigga that's real\n(Timed bomb count down*)\n\nReal niggas, straight off the streets of Compton\nQuick to get in your shit without a second thought\nAnd if your ass get smoked, it's my bullet you caught\nSo if you're talking shit about the niggas in black (*Explosion*)\nBow down to the King's and Raider hats\n\nThey played out, that's what niggas were chanting\nOne nigga left and they said: we ain't happening\nPeople had thought, we was finished and then done wit\nBut if you think about it, yo, we really ain't done shit\nYet, so cover your ears and wipe your tears\nAnd quit sniffing all over my dick for new ideas\nAnd when the new record comes, I'll come like a fucking bump\nAsking for fucking money, don't buy you a fucking crumb\nYou're on the dicks of four niggas not one\nAnd when it comes to dicks, you don't even have one\nSo brace yourself to make sure you don't get fucked up\nBecause if I let you slide, it's just cause you lucked up\nDon't come in my face again, because I'm a floor you\nAnd if you're a bitch, I'ma fucking ignore you\nBecause my attitude is a little bigger\nCause MC Ren is one of the Real Niggas\n\nLost in a motherfucking world of madness\nSadness, but Dre is just a nigga that gladdest\nSucking motherfuckers like you, making whack jams\nBecause it only shows you how dope I am\nNever try to ignore us\nWhen I'm expressing, standstill like you're full of Rigor Mortis\nCause I'm a real nigga, but I guess you figure\nYou can break me, take me, but watch me pull the trigger\nDre is just a nigga with heart, a nigga that's smart\nA nigga that's paid; to say what others are scared to play\nWe started out with too much cargo\nSo I'm glad we got rid of Benedict Arnold\nYo, N.W.A., criticized for what we say\nBut I'ma do the shit anyway\nCause I'm the motherfucking doctor, never faking\nYo, Yella, kick the motherfucking break in\n\nIt's the real thing\nYou are now   ----] Dr. Dre\nReal, real niggas, niggas\nYeah, motherfucker, it's the real thing\nYou are now   ----] Dr. Dre\nReal, real niggas, niggas\n\nN.W.A. - Straight Outta motherfucking Compton\nTaking over shit in all of the 1990s\nYo, Dr. Dre, DJ Yella, Eazy-E and I am MC Ren\nYo, N.W.A. taking over this motherfucker y'all"}}, {"title": "Sa Prize (Fuck Tha Police - Part 2)", "album": "100 Miles and Runnin'", "year": "1990-08-14", "lyrics": "*Phone rings*\nSgt.

Put the joint out!\nHey you motherfuckers want to step out of the car?\nDon't you know it's against the law to play music so god damn loud?\nShut the fuck up! Go to jail? Or gimme that shit you was just smoking\nMotherfuckers from high crime areas view the police as a threat\nAnd that's some shit you betta not forget\n\nEazy E's the name feared by most\nWhen, a lil nigga is thrown in the pen\nBut on the streets there's two kinds of people\nWhite rich fucks and the ones who get harassed like me\nPull over to the side, routine for me\nTearin' up my shit, like they lookin for a key of cocaine\nBut they never find the shit\nAin't got nuttin better to do and nobody else to fuck wit\nThinkin' everything is stolen\nBut can't face facts that a young black nigga's just rollin\nMaking more money than they ever make\nTaking more shit than they ever take\nYo pigs are made to kill, and no regret and\nKeep your hand on your weapon shoot his ass and start steppin\nCause I'm a nigga that don't give a fuck about nothin\nSo let me explain a lil somethin, yo\nSee, I got this problem, a big problem...\nCops don't like me, so I don't like motherfucking cops\n\nEpisode Two:\nGet out of the fuckin car!\nWait a god damn minute what the hell did I do?\nHey just shut the fuck up black bitch\nWait a minute, you ain't gotta be pullin me by my motherfuckin hair! Let\nGo of my motherfuckin hair!\nHey just step the fuck back and shut up!\nGet your motherfuckin' hands off of me!\nCalm down, calm down now... listen, we're gonna go around this corner, and\nYou're gonna suck me and my partner's dicks, or you're gonna\nBe one black dead nigga bitch\n\nPolice brutality is common in my neighborhood\nThat's why I hate them motherfuckers\n\nI said fuck the police but with a little more force\nAnd maybe now I get my point across\nIt's a massacre goin on, just open your eyes and look\nEveryday a young nigga is took\nOff the face of the street by a police\nIt's like they gotta a nigga chained on a short leash\nYou can't leave out the city that they shacked up\nCause if you do that's the right they got you jacked up\nIt's embarassin because you know they justice, but all you can do\nIs say fuck this, because if you move, that's all she wrote\nSo what? The excuse to shoot, or they rather stomp your head\nTil you're dead with the steel-toe boot\nHarassin me with some kind of mind game\nActin like a nigga just was born with a gang-name\nYou call that right but when you're black there's no right\nSome recreational shit was only a gang fight\nSo shootin at the cops was a street thing\nTo waste time as we slanged off the cocaine\nBut everything was done just for peace\nTo retaliate, on the fuckin police, so I'm sayin\n\n(The final episode)\nEpisode Three:\nHey Juan, look at the piece of ass man\nWatch out watch out watch out homes!\nOh shit man you fucked up, you hit a police car\nI didn't see that piece of caca!\nBetter act like you don't speak ingles homes\nWhat the fuck?

Fuck, fuck, fuck the police!\nFuck, fuck, fuck the police!\n You're motherfucking right, yo\n\nFuck the motherfucking police!\nThey don't want peace, they want a nigga deceased\nSo he'll cease to be a problem, and by the way the perform\nIt seems the Klan gave the white police another uniform\nAnd yo the black police, the house niggas\nThey gave you a motherfucking gun, so I guess you figure\nYou made out, good to go, but you didn't know\nThey would stick your black ass back in the ghetto, yo\nTo kill another nigga, catch him with crack, in fact\nFreebase - they put in the neighborhood in the first place\nBut the brothers ain't stupid, remember that\nYou got a gat, I got a gat, so whassup with that\nA to the motherfuckin K\nThe last words you hear, then the smoke appears\nTears, from your motherfuckin family\nThey're starin at me, but I'm goin gun happy, fuck 'em!\nShootin everything in sight tonight's the night to get hyped\nAnd fight for what's wrong, fuck what's right!\nAnd by the way, my name is Dre\nSo listen up motherfucker to what I gotta say, yo\n\n(Now for the first episode)\nYeah that shit's hittin man, where the volume at?\nHold-up, hold-up, hold-up, one-time, one-time, one-time\nPut the joint out! Put the joint out!\nHey you motherfuckers want to step out of the car?\nDon't you know it's against the law to play music so god damn loud?\nShut the fuck up! Go to jail? Or gimme that shit you was just smoking\nMotherfuckers from high crime areas view the police as a threat\nAnd that's some shit you betta not forget\n\nEazy E's the name feared by most\nWhen, a lil nigga is thrown in the pen\nBut on the streets there's two kinds of people\nWhite rich fucks and the ones who get harassed like me\nPull over to the side, routine for me\nTearin' up my shit, like they lookin for a key of cocaine\nBut they never find the shit\nAin't got nuttin better to do and nobody else to fuck wit\nThinkin' everything is stolen\nBut can't face facts that a young black nigga's just rollin\nMaking more money than they ever make\nTaking more shit than they ever take\nYo pigs are made to kill, and no regret and\nKeep your hand on your weapon shoot his ass and start steppin\nCause I'm a nigga that don't give a fuck about nothin\nSo let me explain a lil somethin, yo\nSee, I got this problem, a big problem...\nCops don't like me, so I don't like motherfucking cops\n\nEpisode Two:\nGet out of the fuckin car!\nWait a god damn minute what the hell did I do?\nHey just shut the fuck up black bitch\nWait a minute, you ain't gotta be pullin me by my motherfuckin hair! Let\nGo of my motherfuckin hair!\nHey just step the fuck back and shut up!\nGet your motherfuckin' hands off of me!\nCalm down, calm down now... listen, we're gonna go around this corner, and\nYou're gonna suck me and my partner's dicks, or you're gonna\nBe one black dead nigga bitch\n\nPolice brutality is common in my neighborhood\nThat's why I hate them motherfuckers\n\nI said fuck the police but with a little more force\nAnd maybe now I get my point across\nIt's a massacre goin on, just open your eyes and look\nEveryday a young nigga is took\nOff the face of the street by a police\nIt's like they gotta a nigga chained on a short leash\nYou can't leave out the city that they shacked up\nCause if you do that's the right they got you jacked up\nIt's embarassin because you know they justice, but all you can do\nIs say fuck this, because if you move, that's all she wrote\nSo what? The excuse to shoot, or they rather stomp your head\nTil you're dead with the steel-toe boot\nHarassin me with some kind of mind game\nActin like a nigga just was born with a gang-name\nYou call that right but when you're black there's no right\nSome recreational shit was only a gang fight\nSo shootin at the cops was a street thing\nTo waste time as we slanged off the cocaine\nBut everything was done just for peace\nTo retaliate, on the fuckin police, so I'm sayin\n\n(The final episode)\nEpisode Three:\nHey Juan, look at the piece of ass man\nWatch out watch out watch out homes!\nOh shit man you fucked up, you hit a police car\nI didn't see that piece of caca!\nBetter act like you don't speak ingles homes\nWhat the fuck? Get your ass out of there, I've had enough\nOf your raggedy ass motherfucking shit!\nOh man no me pegues! por que me pegas? No! por favor no! No!

all baby\nGet it all baby\n(What you want me to do with it?)\nDon't matter just don't bite it\n(\"She swallowed it\")\nSuck this dick for daddy\n(\"She swallowed it\")\nJuicin' at the lips\n(\"She swallowed it\")\nIt's the world's biggest dick\n(What do you want me to do with it?)\nDon't matter just don't bite it\n\nSlow is the tempo - now talkin' but a nympho\nSo peep it out here goes the info\nThis is a bitch that did the whole crew\nShe get it so much we make bets on who the ho would love to go through\nAnd for the shit that she does, give her a drum roll\nBecause the dumb bitch licks out the asshole\nAnd she'll let you videotape her\nAnd if you got a gang of niggas, the bitch would let you rape her\nShe likes suckin' on dicks, and lickin' up nut\nAnd they even take the broomstick up the butt\nJust to say that she did it with a rapper\nBut the pussy was more fishy than red snapper\n\"But how many licks would it take,\" she asks\n\"To make MC Ren start gooshin' up vanilla shakes?\"\nShe took her tongue out her mouth, put it on top\nLike a cherry, started movin' it like a snake and it was very irresistable\nI couldn't pay the bitch to quit\nCuz the ho' was doin' some ol' crazy shit\nThat made me start havin' a fit'\nCuz the bitch sucked a hellified dick \n\n\nNow one night I was at a drive-in\nAnd a car full of niggas straight drove in\nI thought they wuz commin' to start trouble but no\nFive niggas in the bucket with the neighborhood ho'\nNow what do you expect they're gonna dogg her like a doggy\nThirty minutes later and the windowz all were foggy\nAnd I'm off in my car havin' a fit cuz the bitch that I'm with\nSaid no fuckin' on the first date, shit\nAnd I'm like Damn! I wish I was in the bucket\nTo be the sixth nigga with the ho' and I can fuck it\nSo I told the bitch I was with that I'm goin' to the snack bar\nAnd got the fuck out the car\nWent to the bucket and I looked through the window\nIt was some niggas that I knew they let me in yo\nAnd my turn was like next\nI couldn't see her face, all I saw was her pussy and her chest\nI wanted to see the face, I felt I oughtta\nPeep over the seat, Oh shit! It's the preacher's daughter!\nAnd she's only 14 and a ho'\nBut the bitch sucks dick like a specialized pro\nShe looked at me, I was surprised\nBut wasn't passin' up the chance of my dick gettin' baptized\nI told the bitch to do it quick\nYou little ho' hurry up and suck my dick!\n\n\nNow I'm a break it down with a fact\nSince the last \"Just don't bite it\" girls don't know how to act\nSayin' that they never would suck a dick\nBut when they've tried it they couldn't quit\nCuz ninety percent of the bitches today they love that shit\nAnd those are the main ones that say they don't do it\nBut MC Ren knows the bitches are used to it\nSo fellas, next time they try to tell a lie\nThat they never suck a dick, punch a bitch in the eye\nAnd then the ho' will fall to the ground\nThen you'll open up her mouth\nPut your dick in and move the shit around\nAnd she'll catch on and start doin' it on her own\nActin' like she's tryin' to suck the meat off a chicken bone\nAnd then she won't let go\nBecause bitches suck nut out of a dick just like Drano\nGet the last drop, unclogging the pipe\nThen the stupid bitch is out doing that same shit the next night\nBecause she just can't quit\nCuz she's addicted, addicted, she's addicted, addicted\nShe's addicted to suck a good dick"}}, {"title": "Something 2 Dance 2", "album": "Straight Outta Compton", "year": "1988-08-08", "lyrics": "Yo give me somethin' to dance to\nCalling the police, Calling the g-men\nCalling all americans to war on the underworld\n\nArabian Prince, back wit' a style that's hype\nNot slow and low, it's the fast type\nGetting dumb, can you hear the drums?\nYo Dre why don't you pump it up some\nI pumped it up so now what's up\nYo Yella boy, add a little cut\nWhat the hell, you think we need some bells\nYeah, homeboy, might as well\nThere it is, so now what's next\nA little ssssssssss - So find me a --\nHold it, wait a minute\nYou need somethin' else in it\nThis is what I want you to do\nFeel the groove, bust a move\nYo, yo, I'm tired, what about you?\nMan this is somethin' to dance to\nMan that's wack, everybody used that\nYo, why dont you bring back the other track\nYeah there you go that's what I'm sayin\nI like it when that dope stuffs playin\nReal loud, in ya ear hole\nMan let's go, I think my feet are swoll' from dancin' so damn much\nMaaaaaan, I don't give a what\nYou wanna leave?

house\nCompton's definitely in the house. Yo Ren, whatta we gonna\nCall this ? Tell'em what yo name is ?\nYeah something like that\nAllright, let's kick this shit on the one\nKick it\n\nBack by demand, now it's big as fuck\nBecause you as the public, you should know what's up\n\"Compton's in the House\" was more than gold, it was a hit\nCause it was based on some crazy shit\nSo our final conclusion has been permitted\nPunks made us a target and knew that we'd hit it\nBut that was a part of showbizz\n\nHey yo homeboy, why don't you tell'em what your name is\n\nWell for the record it's Ren, and for the street it's villain\nAnd strapped with a gat, it's more like Matt Dillon\nOn \"Gunsmoke\", but not a man of the law\nI'm just the baddest motherfucker that you ever saw\nSee, I peep and then I creep on a fool\nGet my bloodpressure high but still stay cool\nDig a grave of a nigga lookin' up to me\nThat really had the nerve that he could fuck with me\nWho was the man in the mass, while I was waitin' to axe\nYou know, it's MC Ren kickin' mucho ass\nGettin' respect in showbizz\nHey yo homeboy\nWhassup ?\nWhy don't you tell'em what yo name is ?\n\nDre, the motherfuckin' doctor, bitch hopper\nThe sucker-motherfucker stopper\nBack with a vocal track that's a fresh one\nSo now, let's get the motherfuckin' session\nGoin', flowin'. It's time to start throwin' - rhymes\nSo keep in mind all the suckers I'm blowin'\nCause I'm a start showin' the time\nNever sayin' I'm the best and just goin' for mine\nUnlike a lotta suckers who claim they're gettin' busy\nWhen their records only make good frisbees\nYou need to quit runnin' off the mouth\nStop and think before you put some whack bullshit out\nIt's not difficult, in fact it's kinda simple\nTo create something funky that's original\nYou either talkin' 'bout the place to be\nWho you are, what you got, or about a sucker MC\n\nOh yeah, that's what I'm talkin' about, Ren\nYou know what I'm sayin' ?\nYeah, I know what you're sayin', Dre, but you\nStill ain't told'em enough, man\nAllright, Allright\nWell, let's kick one more verse right here, allright\nKick it\n\nThis is portable, something to fuck with yo ear\nRen and Dre will appear when the sound is clear\nTo fuck it up like we always do, and that's the trick\nSayin' some shit to make the bitches wanna suck our dicks\nBut it's an everyday thang\nCommunicating to y'all with the Compton slang\nCompton's back in the house and your appartment\nSo open your door, by the way, so we can start it\nTest the monitors and call this mic\nCause the way we feel, we're gonna fuck it up tonight\nI got my mic in my hand, with a hell of a grip\nBitches screamin' and shit, now it's a trip\nWaitin' for the grand finale, or the end\nOr stupid rhymes set by Dre and Ren\nWell, like a kid, we get new shoes and go faster\nSmilin', like hell, as we move past the\nSuckers, the motherfuckers with the ego hype\nWell we're positive and they're on a negative type\nAnd if think we're about to quit...\nMotherfucker you ain't heard shit\n\nYeah, that shit was funky, you know what I'm sayin', Ren ?\nI know what you're sayin', this is MC Ren and Dr.Dre\nCold kickin' it in the place\nAh yeah, my mellow Eazy E in the house\nYella Boy in the house\nMy boy Ice Cube\nArabian Prince cold rockin' shit\nOh yeah, hey, I'm a say whassup to my homeboys from CMW\nYeah, hey, yo Ren, whatta we gonna call this shit?\n\"Tell'em what yo name is?\"\nYeah something like that..."}}, {"title": "Straight Outta Compton", "album": "Straight Outta Compton", "year": "1988-07-10", "lyrics": "You are now about to witness the strength of street knowledge\n\nStraight outta Compton, crazy motherfucker named Ice Cube\nFrom the gang called Niggas Wit Attitudes\nWhen I'm called off, I got a sawed-off\nSqueeze the trigger and bodies are hauled off\nYou too, boy, if you fuck with me\nThe police are gonna have to come and get me\nOff your ass, that's how I'm going out\nFor the punk motherfuckers that's showing out\nNiggas start to mumble, they wanna rumble\nMix 'em and cook 'em in a pot, like gumbo\nGoing off on the motherfucker like that\nWith a gat that's pointed at your ass\nSo give it up smooth\nAin't no telling when I'm down for a jack move\nHere's a murder rap to keep y'all dancin'\nWith a crime record like Charles Manson\nAK-47 is the tool\nDon't make me act a motherfucking fool\nMe you can go toe to toe, no maybe\nI'm knocking niggas out the box, daily\nYo, weekly, monthly and yearly\nUntil them dumb motherfuckers see clearly\nThat I'm down with the capital C-P-T\nBoy, you can't fuck with me\nSo when I'm in your neighborhood, you better duck\n\u2018Cause Ice Cube is crazy as fuck\nAs I leave, believe I'm stompin'\nBut when I come back boy, I'm coming straight outta Compton\n(Compton Compton Compton)\n\nYo, Ren!

motherfucker named Ice Cube\nFrom the gang called Niggas Wit Attitudes\nWhen I'm called off, I got a sawed-off\nSqueeze the trigger and bodies are hauled off\nYou too, boy, if you fuck with me\nThe police are gonna have to come and get me\nOff your ass, that's how I'm going out\nFor the punk motherfuckers that's showing out\nNiggas start to mumble, they wanna rumble\nMix 'em and cook 'em in a pot, like gumbo\nGoing off on the motherfucker like that\nWith a gat that's pointed at your ass\nSo give it up smooth\nAin't no telling when I'm down for a jack move\nHere's a murder rap to keep y'all dancin'\nWith a crime record like Charles Manson\nAK-47 is the tool\nDon't make me act a motherfucking fool\nMe you can go toe to toe, no maybe\nI'm knocking niggas out the box, daily\nYo, weekly, monthly and yearly\nUntil them dumb motherfuckers see clearly\nThat I'm down with the capital C-P-T\nBoy, you can't fuck with me\nSo when I'm in your neighborhood, you better duck\n\u2018Cause Ice Cube is crazy as fuck\nAs I leave, believe I'm stompin'\nBut when I come back boy, I'm coming straight outta Compton\n(Compton Compton Compton)\n\nYo, Ren! (Whassup?)\nTell 'em where you from!\n\nStraight outta Compton, another crazy ass nigga\nMore punks I smoke, yo, my rep gets bigger\nI'm a bad motherfucker, and you know this\nBut the pussy-ass niggas won't show this\nBut I don't give a fuck, I'ma make my snaps\nIf not from the records, from jacking or craps\nJust like burglary, the definition is jacking\nAnd when I'm legally armed it's called packing\nShoot a motherfucker in a minute\nI find a good piece of pussy and go up in it\nSo if you're at a show in the front row\nI'ma call you a bitch or dirty-ass ho\nYou'll probably get mad like a bitch is supposed to\nBut that shows me, slut, you're composed to\nA crazy motherfucker from the street\nAttitude legit, \u2018cause I'm tearing up shit\nMC Ren controls the automatic\nFor any dumb motherfucker that starts static\nNot the right hand, \u2018cause I'm the hand itself\nEvery time I pull an AK off the shelf\nThe security is maximum, and that's a law\nR-E-N spells Ren, but I'm raw\nSee, \u2018cause I'm the motherfucking villain\nThe definition is clear, you're the witness of a killin'\nThat's taking place without a clue\nAnd once you're on the scope, your ass is through\nLook, you might take it as a trip\nBut a nigga like Ren is on a gangsta tip\nStraight outta Compton\n(Compton Compton Compton)\n(Straight outta Compton)\n\nEazy is his name, and the boy is coming\u2026\n\n\u2026Straight outta Compton\nIs a brother that'll smother your mother\nAnd make your sister think I love her\nDangerous motherfucker raising hell\nAnd if I ever get caught, I make bail\nSee, I don't give a fuck, that's the problem\nI see a motherfucking cop, I don't dodge him\nBut I'm smart, lay low, creep a while\nAnd when I see a punk pass, I smile\nTo me it's kinda funny, the attitude showing a nigga driving\nBut don't know where the fuck he's going, just rolling\nLooking for the one they call Eazy\nBut here's a flash, they'll never seize me\nRuthless, never seen, like a shadow in the dark\nExcept when I unload\nYou see a spark and jump over hesitation\nAnd hear the scream of the one who got the lead penetration\nFeel a little gust of wind and I'm jetting\nBut leave a memory no one'll be forgetting\nSo what about the bitch who got shot? Fuck her!\nYou think I give a damn about a bitch? I ain't a sucker\nThis is an autobiography of the E\nAnd if you ever fuck with me\nYou'll get taken by a stupid dope brother who will smother\nWord to the motherfucker, straight outta Compton\n(Compton Compton Compton)\n(Straight outta Compton)\n\nDamn, that shit was dope!"}}, {"title": "Straight Outta Compton 2015", "album": null, "year": null, "lyrics": "Verse 1: (Backy Boo Boo)\nOh no here we go again.

"You are now about to witness the strength of street knowledge\n\nStraight outta Compton, it's a crazy brotha named Ice Cube\nFrom the stupid-dope gang wit a attitude\nWhen I'm called off, I gotta sawed-off\nKick knowledge and bodies are hauled off\nYou too boy if you get with me\nThe police are gonna have to come and get me\nOff yo back, that's how I'm going out\nFor the sucka dumb brothas that's showing out\nSome start to mumble, they wanna rumble\nMix em and cook em in a pot like gumbo\nGoing off on everybody like that\nWith bass that's droppin' in your face\nSo give it up smooth\nAin't no telling when I'm down for a jack move\nHere's a murder rap to keep you dancing\nWith a crime record like Charles Manson\nYo Dre, what's the sound of my tool?\nNow you know that I'm about to act a fool\nMe you can go toe to toe, no maybe\nI'm knocking suckas out the box, daily\nYo weekly, monthly and yearly\nUntil the whole damn world see clearly\nThat I'm down with the capital C-P-T\nBoy, you can't step to me\nSo when I'm in your neighborhood, you better duck down\nCause Ice Cube will damn sure buck 'em down\nAs I leave, believe I'm stomping\nBut when I come back boy, I'm coming straight outta Compton\n\nYo Ren\n\nWhassup\n\nTell em where you from\n\nStraight outta Compton, a brotha with his finger on the trigger\nMore punks I take out, my rep gets bigger\nI'm a ruthless villain and you know this\nBut the suckas in the public won't show this\nBut I don't really care, I'mma make my snaps\nIf not from the records, from jacking the craps\nIt's like burglary, the definition is jacking\nAnd when illegally armed it's called packing\nKnock a fool out in a sec\nI find somebody talkin' trash and put em in check\nSo if you're at a show in the front row\nI'mma call you a sucka if you don't go with the flow\nYou'll probably get mad like a punk is supposed to\nBut that shows me, yo, you're composed to\nA crazy young brotha from the street\nAttitude legit cause I'm ready to hit\nMC Ren controls the automatic\nFor any fool in my way that starts static\nNot the right hand cause I'm the hand itself\nEvery time I pull a AK off the shelf\nThe security is maximum and that's a law\nR-E-N spells Ren but I'm raw\nSee, cause people know me as a villain\nThe definition is clear, you're the witness of a killing\nThat's taking place without a clue\nAnd once you're on the scope, you know you're through\nLook, you might take it as a trip\nBut a brotha like Ren is on a gangsta tip\nStraight outta Compton\n\nEazy is his name and the boy is coming\n\nStraight outta Compton\nIs a brother that'll smother your mother\nAnd make your sister think I love her\nDangerous young brotha raising hell\nAnd if I ever get caught, I make bail\nSee I don't really care, that's the problem\nWhen I see a police, I don't dodge him\nBut I'm smart, lay low, creep a while\nAnd when I see the punk pass, I smile\nTo me it's kinda funny, the attitude showing suckas driving\nBut don't know where the hell they going, just rolling\nLooking for the one they call Eazy\nBut here's a flash, they never seize me\nRuthless\nNever seen like a shadow in the dark\nExcept when I unload\nYou see I'll get over the hesitation\nAnd hear the scream of the one who got the lead penetration\nFeel a little gust of wind and now I'm jetting\nAnd leave a memory no one'll be forgetting\nSo what about the girl who got shot \nYou think I give a damn about a girl, I ain't a sucker\nThis is the autobiography of the E\nAnd if you ever mess with me\nYou'll get taken by a stupid dope brother who will smother\nWord to the mother, yeah!\nStraight outta Compton\n\nThat's the way it goes in the city of Compton, boy"}}, {"title": "Straight Outta Compton [Extended Mix]", "album":

give a f***, that's the problem\nI see a motherf***in cop I don't dodge him\nBut I'm smart, lay low, creep a while\nAnd when I see a punk pass, I smile\nTo me it's kinda funny, the attitude showin a n**** drivin\nBut don't know where the f*** he's going, just rollin\nLookin for the one they call Eazy\nBut here's a flash, they never seize me\nRuthless! Never seen like a shadow in the dark\nExcept when I unload, see I'll get over the hesitation\nAnd hear the scream of the one who got the last penetration\nGive a little gust of wind and I'm jettin\nBut leave a memory no one'll be forgettin\nSo what about the b**** who got shot? f*** her!\nYou think I give a damn about a b****? I ain't a sucka!\nThis is the autobiography of the E, and if you ever f*** with me\nYou'll get taken by a stupid dope brotha who will smother\nWord to the motherf***er, straight outta Compton\nChorus:"}}, {"title": "Straight Outta Compton [Tracklist + Album Art]", "album": "Straight Outta Compton", "year": "1988-08-08", "lyrics": "Tracklist:\n1.

wayback\nWhen niggas in Compton first started to jack\nWhen the bitches wouldn't give you no pussy if you wasn't sellin' drugs\nSo many bitches in my neighborhood got mugged\nThey always loved that shit, they want a nigga that's sellin' keys\nBut nowadays they workin' at Mickey D's\nBut in the days of wayback, I couldn't be laid back\nBecause I needed ends and I made that\nI get the nine from my nigga that he lend me and\nStart robbin' muthafuckas, just like cowboys and indians\nAnything it took to get paid\nA nigga like Ren already had the plan made\nAnd I was in it to win it and not to lose\nAnd shit, it start blowin' up, once I lit the fuse\nAnd police couldn't touch me because I was payin'em\nBut not with no money, yo, I was sprayin' 'em\nAnd never get caught because nobody is snitch\nBut one ho did - so Ren had to shoot the bitch!\nNow she's in a coffin and my life is better off and\nCause everybody knows who's the bossin':\nThat black nigga that they call Ren\nYou fuck with me, you gotta fuck with a Mac-10\nSo listen to me as I reminisce the days of wayback\nSo check it out y'all\n\nIt was once a time in the days of wayback\nWhen niggas was gettin' jacked\nIn fact it was one I used to pass through up\nAnd kickin' ass through up\nMuthafuckin' Compton Massacre...\nNow let me tell you a little something about Compton\nWhen I was a kid and puttin' my bid in\nYo, Compton was like still water - just strictly calm\nNow it's like muthafuckin' Vietnam\nEverybody killin', tryin' to make a killin'\nNiggas stealin', muthafuckas willin' to dealin'\nWith so many ways to come up\nThe average nigga didn't give a fuck\nAbout another muthafucka in this game and\nClaimin' what he claimin'\nLivin' like he livin'\nKillin' after killin'\nMurder was a dirty job. To rob a dead man\nWas the best plan cause a dead man never ran\nBut now your best friend is your worst friend\nGreed, cash the fee. Make a me more some of what you holdin'\nSo now your shit is stolen\nAnd you and your niggas start rollin'\nYo, to get your shit back ain't a word of\nMuff? It's more murder, more murder, more murder\nThey wanna make you think that it's a crack thang\nOr a black thang\nOr some niggas in a muthafuckin' gang...\nBut guns and money they go together like the Ku Klux Klan\nA nigga brung up and strung up\nWhy do I call myself a nigga you ask me?\nRememberin' the days that's past me...\nYo, never givin' niggas a chance to rest\nThe ghetto is like a fuckin' survival test\nAnd number one way for you to pass\nYo, get treated like a king and they'll crown your ass\nThey never in the wrong though\nSo I made a song so\nMuthafuckas would know\nIf your livin' situations make you wanna get a gat...\nThat's cause you livin' in the Dayz of Wayback...\n\nSurprise, niggas!\nYou don't think i can do it again, bitch... Another album... The jokes on you Jack... We did it again...

attack\nCutting ducks no slack so keep your bitch ass back\nDeadly, yeah kicking it, the solo style\nOn top of the pile, the reigning chump worthwile\nHanging tough I'm the leader, ain't no need to pretend\nLike an elevator up, I mean I'm on the ascend\nI ain't no east coast rapper, this is a southerner's song\nBe warned, it's hard to try and hold a project born\nSaying shit that you like, never wearing no Nike\nFucking it up and all I need is my goddamn mic\nAnd a micstand, I don't need no band to play\nWith a DJ like Rock and a partner like K in effect y'all\nFucking suckers up like five\nIt's Fila Fresh and I'm the toughest man alive!\n\nNa-na-na-na-na-naaaaa-nah\nYo, yo nigga you know you can't even fuck with this\nDo it, do it\nNa-na-na-na-na-naaaaa-nah\nYo, fool, you know you need to jet the fuck off\nGet the fuck out my face\n\nDown from the beginning, hitting hard I'll admit\nThey keep offering me money and I keep taking the shit\nAnd coolin' cool at the crib cause being cool's how I live\nBut bucking up will get you rocked if you're a bullshit kid\nI like it stylistic, c'mon let's get with it\nComing up with fresh new rhymes like I'm a mystic\nYou see the D.O.C. and all the Fila I be splurging\nYeah, I know it, you think that I'm encouraging\nYou to step wrong boy, so I can go off\nA quick run and when I'm done you bet not cough\nI'm an annihilator, standing a

round the way who won't quit\n\"It's the old top\" Man shoot that muthafucking shit\nI'm physically tough, physically able I qualify\nDon't try that gangster bullshit here, this ain't no I Spy\nYou

your garage\nI'm down for showing all you hoes who the hell's in charge\nA cold lethal rap warrior, I'm on the attack\nCutting ducks no slack so keep your bitch ass back\nDeadly, yeah kicking it, the solo style\nOn top of the pile, the reigning chump worthwile\nHanging tough I'm the leader, ain't no need to pretend\nLike an elevator up, I mean I'm on the ascend\nI ain't no east coast rapper, this is a southerner's song\nBe warned, it's hard to try and hold a project born\nSaying shit that you like, never wearing no Nike\nFucking it up and all I need is my goddamn mic\nAnd a micstand, I don't need no band to play\nWith a DJ like Rock and a partner like K in effect y'all\nFucking suckers up like five\nIt's Fila Fresh and I'm the toughest man alive!\n\nNa-na-na-na-na-naaaaa-nah\nYo, yo nigga you know you can't even fuck with this\nDo it, do it\nNa-na-na-na-na-naaaaa-nah\nYo, fool, you know you need to jet the fuck off\nGet the fuck out my face\n\nDown from the beginning, hitting hard I'll admit\nThey keep offering me money and I keep taking the shit\nAnd coolin' cool at the crib cause being cool's how I live\nBut bucking up will get you rocked if you're a bullshit kid\nI like it stylistic, c'mon let's get with it\nComing up with fresh new rhymes like I'm a mystic\nYou see the D.O.C. and all the Fila I be splurging\nYeah, I know it, you think that I'm encouraging\nYou to step wrong boy, so I can go off\nA quick run and when I'm done you bet not cough\nI'm an annihilator, standing a full 6'3\"\nAnd I really don't think you wanna fuck with me\nBut then there's always those, clocking all your shows\nGetting all out of line trying to impress they hoes\nI know some niggas like that round the way who won't quit\n\"It's the old top\" Man shoot that muthafucking shit\nI'm physically tough, physically able I qualify\nDon't try that gangster bullshit here, this ain't no I Spy\nYou better chill out, that's if you wanna survive\nIt's Fila Fresh and we're the toughest men alive\n\nYeah, for all you suckers who thought I was down, that's right\nKicking that bullshit, yeah we in effect, that's right\nHolmes, we in effect so get your bitch ass back before you\nBe floating up a creek, know what I'm sayin?\n\nFloat, float on...\n\nYeah, and if you want your beast to be deaf, call Dre before Monday!"}}], "artist": "N.W.A"}
