Phife?\nOnce Again Tip\nWord\nWatch me bust they shit\nOK\n\nOhhhh, you did it to me once again my friend\nI swear you do it to me everytime\nCause you stay crazy on my mind\nYo you got it goin on (say word), on and on and on\nOn and on and on\n\nThis is the year that I come in and just devastate\nMy style is great ask your peoples can I dominate?\nMy rhymes are harder than last night's erection\nDon't play me close, I'll have this mic up in your mid-section\nMy shit is lovely simply meaning that my joint is tight\nAmping up the mic making sure production's tight\nSometimes I might catch a severe case of writer's block\nBut by the end of the day you'll be on my jock\nMy name's Malik my hobby's putting MC's to the test\nAnd if you front I'll put my foot up in your freaking chest\nFreestyle fanatic, and never will it ever stop\nYou crew is loose, you might just want to call the cops\n\nAye, yo I gotta put some action on paper\nMake sure my verse jump up and spread out like the raper\nThe only tip I got for a waiter\nIs watch the doorknob hit me where the dirty dog shoulda' bit me\nThat was my train of thought, but for so long I fought\nNow I'm at a level supreme to the devil\nSo turn up the bass and lay low on the treble\nWe be the real MC's and you dead, bring a shovel\nRevitalize, the vital Tribe nigga, WHAT?\nThe ladies sweat the style like the squirrel sweat the nuts\nYou know a fellas good for the moola\nDon't smoke no woolas, read the name call me Slick Tip the Ruler\n\nOhhhh, you did it to me once again my friend\nI swear you do it to me everytime\nCause you stay crazy on my mind\nYo you got it goin on (say word), on and on and on\nOn and on and on\n\nYo I've been treading on this globe man for twenty-five joints\nSometimes Shaitan got me by the pressure points\nBut I can break a fella down like sex\nYou eat Wheat Chex but still light in the ass and can't flex\nIf one nigga front I'mma make more pay\nCause tonight, we gettin off like O.J\nAnd yo I got a Dawg that bites, fuck the barking\nYo I got a crew with the beats and the smarts and\n\nI fought my shit up on Linden in the one-nine-two\nForever writing never biting ain't shit else to do\nHoping to battle, but most MC's ain't ready yet\nBut if they utter one word then it's as good as set\nYou have MC's dropping bombs that's incredible\nSome of the brothers, their styles are just despicable\nAs for me see I just do how I love to do\nTry to deny me of my props then I'll be seeing you\nMost of you suckers wanna be down for the tag along\nThe freaking fame, someone tell em that this shit ain't games\nYou gots to do this from your heart meaning your inner soul\nAnd if it's real only then will you be on a roll\nI try to stay on top my game there ain't no time to lose\nFour albums deep as a Quester but still we payin' dues\nSo hear me out one time, you gots to be yourself\nCause if you ain't yourself you end up by your freaking self\nI'm coming rugged with the Linden Boule type of slang\nAnd yo, we'll see who can hang yo\nYou on point Tip?\nYo once Again Phife\nYou on point Tip?\nYo once Again Phife\nYou on point Tip?\nYo once again Phife\nAyo that kid is niiiiiiiice\n\nOhhhh, you did it to me once again my friend\nI swear you do it to me everytime\nCause you stay crazy on my mind\nYo you got it goin on (say word), on and on and on\nOn and on and on", "image": "https://images.genius.com/545e415f0da721bd442fd99d31694a6c.878x870x1.jpg", "artist": "A Tribe Called Quest", "raw": {"annotation_count": 32, "api_path": "/songs/44641",

shit\nOK\n\nOhhhh, you did it to me once again my friend\nI swear you do it to me everytime\nCause you stay crazy on my mind\nYo you got it goin on (say word), on and on and on\nOn and on and on\n\nThis is the year that I come in and just devastate\nMy style is great ask your peoples can I dominate?\nMy rhymes are harder than last night's erection\nDon't play me close, I'll have this mic up in your mid-section\nMy shit is lovely simply meaning that my joint is tight\nAmping up the mic making sure production's tight\nSometimes I might catch a severe case of writer's block\nBut by the end of the day you'll be on my jock\nMy name's Malik my hobby's putting MC's to the test\nAnd if you front I'll put my foot up in your freaking chest\nFreestyle fanatic, and never will it ever stop\nYou crew is loose, you might just want to call the cops\n\nAye, yo I gotta put some action on paper\nMake sure my verse jump up and spread out like the raper\nThe only tip I got for a waiter\nIs watch the doorknob hit me where the dirty dog shoulda' bit me\nThat was my train of thought, but for so long I fought\nNow I'm at a level supreme to the devil\nSo turn up the bass and lay low on the treble\nWe be the real MC's and you dead, bring a shovel\nRevitalize, the vital Tribe nigga, WHAT?\nThe ladies sweat the style like the squirrel sweat the nuts\nYou know a fellas good for the moola\nDon't smoke no woolas, read the name call me Slick Tip the Ruler\n\nOhhhh, you did it to me once again my friend\nI swear you do it to me everytime\nCause you stay crazy on my mind\nYo you got it goin on (say word), on and on and on\nOn and on and on\n\nYo I've been treading on this globe man for twenty-five joints\nSometimes Shaitan got me by the pressure points\nBut I can break a fella down like sex\nYou eat Wheat Chex but still light in the ass and can't flex\nIf one nigga front I'mma make more pay\nCause tonight, we gettin off like O.J\nAnd yo I got a Dawg that bites, fuck the barking\nYo I got a crew with the beats and the smarts and\n\nI fought my shit up on Linden in the one-nine-two\nForever writing never biting ain't shit else to do\nHoping to battle, but most MC's ain't ready yet\nBut if they utter one word then it's as good as set\nYou have MC's dropping bombs that's incredible\nSome of the brothers, their styles are just despicable\nAs for me see I just do how I love to do\nTry to deny me of my props then I'll be seeing you\nMost of you suckers wanna be down for the tag along\nThe freaking fame, someone tell em that this shit ain't games\nYou gots to do this from your heart meaning your inner soul\nAnd if it's real only then will you be on a roll\nI try to stay on top my game there ain't no time to lose\nFour albums deep as a Quester but still we payin' dues\nSo hear me out one time, you gots to be yourself\nCause if you ain't yourself you end up by your freaking self\nI'm coming rugged with the Linden Boule type of slang\nAnd yo, we'll see who can hang yo\nYou on point Tip?\nYo once Again Phife\nYou on point Tip?\nYo once Again Phife\nYou on point Tip?\nYo once again Phife\nAyo that kid is niiiiiiiice\n\nOhhhh, you did it to me once again my friend\nI swear you do it to me everytime\nCause you stay crazy on my mind\nYo you got it goin on (say word), on and on and on\nOn and on and on"}}, {"title": "4 Moms", "album": "The Love

it\nYo Tip I tell you man the devil's tryin' it\nBut I'm goin' to stay strong cause I ain't buyin' it\nTonight I'm taking Sherry out, I don't have jack to wear\nYou know I gots to look dipped in the fresh new gear\nCool I found something so I ironed it\nI then got caught up on the phone, oh shit, I'm frying it\nWill someone tell me what did I do to deserve this?\nI think I'll, pull out my suit for Sunday service\nMy little brother wants Barney, cool, I'm gettin' it\nTook him down to Kay-Bee, they ain't sellin' it\nHere we go with the crying, yo he's throwing fits\nMy blood pressure's

I'm gonna smack her up\nI got the tickets for the Knicks and she cold stood me up\nI need to hit a honey off, Jarobi pass the phone\nPulled out my book of hoes, oh yo, Sheila's home\nSteady smiling like a mother yo I'm read' to bone\nWent down on hon, she's in the red zone\nStressed out more than anyone could ever be\nForever tryin' to clear the samples for my new LP\nEverybody knows I go to Georgia often\nGot on the flight and I ended up in Boston\nWith all these trials and tribulations, yo, I've been affected\nAnd to top it off, Starks got ejected\n\nProblems, problems, problems\nWoe is me I'm having problems, problems, problems\n\nJust last week my girl was stressin' me\nNow her best friend be undressing me\nWell I was loving her by the moon ray\nNow I'm tricking on her like Kinte' (c'mon)\nBought a bag of izm from the smoke shop\nWalking towards the car, here come the damn cops\nNow I'm station bound for the Thai sticks\nI bought it for my man, I don't believe this shit\nCoach sat me down from the ball team\nCause I was breaking niggas on the inseams\nSome niggas 'cross town was trying to stick me\nAll I had was shorts, a dollar fifty\nPicked up this girl in the hooptie\nJust because I rhyme she tried to soup me\nPay for this, pay for that, loot for nails and hair\nWho the hell you think I am, Mr. Belvedere?\nGo and get a bloody job, then can we look cute\nEven if you give me boots, you'll never see my loot\nShe wasn't even all of that, just another hooker\nSo I turned that ass away, quick like Chuckii Booker\nSometimes you gotta put the hoes in their friggin' place\nJust move from in front me with your batty face!\n\nProblems, problems, problems\nLord knows I'm havin' problems, problems, problems\nJesus Christ I'm havin' problems, problems, problems\nPray for me I'm havin' problems, problems, problems\nYeah\nYeah\nJust lay down your burdens by the riverside\nHah, and you'll be alright, know what I'm sayin'?\nLove and peace from Phife for '93, know what I'm sayin'?\nTribe Called Quest, Shaheed and Tip\nThis is how we flip\nMy man Muhammad in the house, huh \nZulu Nation in the house, huh \nSubroc is in the house, huh \nMy man Skeff in the house, huh \nJarobi White is in the house, huh \nBob Power in the house, huh \nMy man Eric in the house, huh \nMy man Litro in the house, huh \n\nHelp me out y'all, help me out now\nHelp me out y'all, help me out now\nHelp me out God, I really need ya\nHelp me out now, I really need ya\nHelp me out y'all, help me out now\nI'm having problems, help me out now\nReally need ya, to help me out now\nHelp me out y'all, help me out now\nHelp me out y'all, help me out now\nHelp me out y'all, help me out now\nHelp me out God, I really need ya\nHavin problems, help me out now\n[Help me, help me,

hours it was cool, after hours it was cool\n\nTen after one I think I'll hop the horse\nDowntown 83 of course\nJust came from fishing, couldn't get a catch\nDowntown they'll probably have a batch\nA whiting sandwich and a Guinness Stout\nBut with the beer though I had a bout\nSo I exchanged it for some apple juice\nI had the blues but I shook them loose\nA jeep is blasting from the urban streets\nLoops of funk over hardcore beats\nThe moon dabbles in the morning sky\nAs the minutes just creep on by\nI get a thought and here comes my Tribe\nRitual shakes and in good vibes\nLike always the Quest begins\nIn the mist though but the rhythms moving\nWe find a spot and we sit and chat\nSpeaking on the status quo of rap\nA derelict makes a real long speech\nWe pay attention to the words he read\nWhen he was done we rattled on\nThere was no rush because it wasn't dawn\nWe pointed things out about these times\nThe worlds famines and the crazy crimes\nInflation of the nation, it bothers me\nI better go gold, to pay the taxes\nGotta be swift 'n society\nThe man whose made is the man who maxes\nThe grounds for living are being discussed\nAs we go, it gets close to dusk\nGather thoughts and savor breath\n'Cause there's only a few hours left\n\nAfter hours it was cool, after hours it was cool\nAfter hours it was cool, after hours it was cool\nAfter hours it was cool, after hours it was cool\nAfter hours it was cool, after hours it was cool\n\nMe oh my, hey-hey, hey-hey\nThe human hours are here to stay\nThis is how it seems as Phife's my witness\nBug out all night, ask Phife, he's with this\nGirls be screaming on this conversation\nI have my two cents for a revelation\nAnd my watch continuously tic-tocks\nShaheed will bring up the beats that rocks\nI hear the frogs and the smashing of bottles\nA car revs up and I hear it throttle\nIt probably moves with the morning wind\nOh my God, here's Phife again\nHear him talking about last night's game\nTrying to remember someone's name\nSo hear the frogs dancing in the streets\nOnce again Ali will bring up the beat\nLike this\n\n*sounds of frogs\n\nThe beat is over and so is the night\nThe sun is risen and the shine is bright\nWe all say peace and go our separate ways\nYouth is fading as we gain our days\nExpedition for the song is simp'\nThe hours creep, excuse me, I mean limp\nAs we go you hear a gasp of laugh\nAs we start up our rhythmic path\nLike this\n\nAfter hours it was cool, after hours it was cool\nAfter hours it was cool, after hours it was cool\nAfter hours it was cool, after hours it was cool\nAfter hours it was cool, after hours it was cool", "image": "https://images.genius.com/6527566f22d216ea6df0175321c3e473.997x1000x1.png", "artist": "A Tribe Called Quest", "raw":

hours it was cool, after hours it was cool\nAfter hours it was cool, after hours it was cool\nAfter hours it was cool, after hours it was cool\nAfter hours it was cool, after hours it was cool\n\nTen after one I think I'll hop the horse\nDowntown 83 of course\nJust came from fishing, couldn't get a catch\nDowntown they'll probably have a batch\nA whiting sandwich and a Guinness Stout\nBut with the beer though I had a bout\nSo I exchanged it for some apple juice\nI had the blues but I shook them loose\nA jeep is blasting from the urban streets\nLoops of funk over hardcore beats\nThe moon dabbles in the morning sky\nAs the minutes just creep on by\nI get a thought and here comes my Tribe\nRitual shakes and in good vibes\nLike always the Quest begins\nIn the mist though but the rhythms moving\nWe find a spot and we sit and chat\nSpeaking on the status quo of rap\nA derelict makes a real long speech\nWe pay attention to the words he read\nWhen he was done we rattled on\nThere was no rush because it wasn't dawn\nWe pointed things out about these times\nThe worlds famines and the crazy crimes\nInflation of the nation, it bothers me\nI better go gold, to pay the taxes\nGotta be swift 'n society\nThe man whose made is the man who maxes\nThe grounds for living are being discussed\nAs we go, it gets close to dusk\nGather thoughts and savor breath\n'Cause there's only a few hours left\n\nAfter hours it was cool, after hours it was cool\nAfter hours it was cool, after hours it was cool\nAfter hours it was cool, after hours it was cool\nAfter hours it was cool, after hours it was cool\n\nMe oh my, hey-hey, hey-hey\nThe human hours are here to stay\nThis is how it seems as Phife's my witness\nBug out all night, ask Phife, he's with this\nGirls be screaming on this conversation\nI have my two cents for a revelation\nAnd my watch continuously tic-tocks\nShaheed will bring up the beats that rocks\nI hear the frogs and the smashing of bottles\nA car revs up and I hear it throttle\nIt probably moves with the morning wind\nOh my God, here's Phife again\nHear him talking about last night's game\nTrying to remember someone's name\nSo hear the frogs dancing in the streets\nOnce again Ali will bring up the beat\nLike this\n\n*sounds of frogs\n\nThe beat is over and so is the night\nThe sun is risen and the shine is bright\nWe all say peace and go our separate ways\nYouth is fading as we gain our days\nExpedition for the song is simp'\nThe hours creep, excuse me, I mean limp\nAs we go you hear a gasp of laugh\nAs we start up our rhythmic path\nLike this\n\nAfter hours it was cool, after hours it was cool\nAfter hours it was cool, after hours it was cool\nAfter hours it was cool, after hours it was cool\nAfter hours it was cool, after hours it was cool"}}, {"title": "Against the World", "album": "The Love Movement", "year": "1998-09-29", "lyrics": "Back at you\nRight back at you\n\nDrove around the block, drove a lot\nLookin' all around,

baseball hat\nMoonlight dancin' inside of your eyes\nClose your legs, I start to sigh\nNow I reach down to unlace my Nikes\nKick off your Adidas 'cause that's what you like\nChris Tucker joke passed inside of my head\nPut the thought away, think of you instead\nHot outside, it's hot in here\nRoll down the window, the breeze in your hair\nYour earrings shake, you a baby doll\nYou say you want me but did you want them all?\nMake me feel special, I know that you can\nMake me feel special like a prominent man\nProminent, dominant McCoy and I'm real\nAnother brother's fan?

don't see no cops\nWhisper in your ears, a ghetto star\nSittin' on my lap inside of my car\nLookin' at my lips, take a taste\nTaste yours too, rub your back\nRun your fingers on the logo of my baseball hat\nMoonlight dancin' inside of your eyes\nClose your legs, I start to sigh\nNow I reach down to unlace my Nikes\nKick off your Adidas 'cause that's what you like\nChris Tucker joke passed inside of my head\nPut the thought away, think of you instead\nHot outside, it's hot in here\nRoll down the window, the breeze in your hair\nYour earrings shake, you a baby doll\nYou say you want me but did you want them all?\nMake me feel special, I know that you can\nMake me feel special like a prominent man\nProminent, dominant McCoy and I'm real\nAnother brother's fan? Forget how you feel\n\nMe and you girl go against the world\nAgainst the world?\nHell yeah the world\nMe and you girl go against the world\nAgainst the world?\nHell yeah the world\nMe and you girl go against the world\nAgainst the world?\nHell yeah the world\nMe and you girl go against the world\nAgainst the world?\nHell yeah the world\nYeah the world\nYeah the world\nYeah the world\nWhole wide world\nYeah the world\nYeah the world\nYeah the world\nWhole wide world\nYeah the world\nYeah the world\n\nDame un beso, s'il vous plait\nOr can you hold my hand, it's better that way\nIf we was on video, I'd press rewind\nA nigga think about you all the time\nPigeon dropped a note, on top my head\nRnB, pop, girls thoroughbred\nRun around the track, let me slow you dowwwwnnnnnn...\nPick you up\nRaise your cup, let love erupt\nVol-ca-no, natural disast'\nFall in love with me? Huh, well that's that ass\nWanna get you, inside my world\nProcess, straight, afro or curl\nStretch me out, phase me in\nForever you and me, let me see you grin\nHe fucked you, I'mma tap his chin\nMake me feel special, I know that you can\nMake me feel special like a prominent man\nProminent, dominant, McCoy and I'm real\nAnother brother's fan? Forget how you feel\n\nMe and you girl go against the world\nAgainst the world?\nHell yeah the world\nMe and you girl go against the world\nAgainst the world?\nHell yeah the world\nMe and you honey go

York, NJ, NC, VA\nWe on Award Tour with Muhammad my man\nGoing each and every place with the mic in their hand\nOaktown, LA, San Fran, St. John\n\nPeople give your ears so I be sublime\nIt's enjoyable to know you and your concubines\nNiggas, take off your coats, ladies act like gems\nSit down, Indian style, as we recite these hymns\nSee, lyrically I'm Mario Andretti on the MOMO\nLudicrously speedy, or infectious with the slow-mo\nHeard me in the eighties, J.B.'s on \"The Promo\"\nIn my never-ending quest to get the paper on the caper\nBut now, let me take it to the Queens side\nI'm taking it to Brooklyn side\nAll the residential Questers who invade the air\nHold up a second son, cause we almost there\nYou can be a black man and lose all your soul\nYou can be white and groove but don't crap the roll\nSee my shit is universal if you got knowledge of dolo\nOr delf or self, see there's no one else\nWho can drop it on the angle, acute at that\nSo, do that, do that, do do that that that (come on)\nDo that, do that, do do that that that (OK)\nDo that, do that, do do that that that\nI'm bugging out but let me get back cause I'm wetting niggas\nSo run and tell the others cause we are the brothers\nI learned how to build mics in my workshop class\nSo give me this award, and let's not make it the last\n\nWe on Award Tour with Muhammad my man\nGoing each and every place with the mic in their hand\nChinatown, Spokane, London, Tokyo\nWe on Award Tour with Muhammad my man\nGoing each and every place with the mic in their hand\nHouston, Delaware, DC, Dallas\n\nBack in '89 I simply slid in the place\nBuddy, buddy, buddy all up in your face\nA lot of kids was busting rhymes but they had no taste\nSome said Quest was wack, but now is that the case?\nI have a quest to have a mic in my hand\nWithout that, it's like Kryptonite and Superman\nSo Shaheed come in with the sugar cuts\nPhife Dawg's my name, but on stage, call me Dynomutt\nWhen was the last time you heard the Phife sloppy\nLyrics anonymous, you'll never hear me copy\nTop notch baby, never coming less\nSky's the limit, you gots to believe up in Quest\nSit back, relax, get up out the path\nIf not that, here's a dancefloor, come move that ass\nNon-believers, you can check the stats\nI roll with Shaheed and the brother Abstract\nNiggas know the time when Quest is in the jam\nI never let a statue tell me how nice I am\nComing with more hits than the Braves and the Yankees\nLiving mad phat like an oversized mampi\nThe wackest crews try to diss, it makes me laugh\nWhen my track record's longer than a DC-20 aircraft\nSo, next time that you think you want somethin' here\nMake something def or take that garbage to St. Elsewhere\n\nWe on Award Tour with Muhammad my man\nGoing each and every place with the mic in their hand\nSC, Maryland, New Orleans, Motown\nWe on Award Tour with Muhammad my man\nGoing each and every place with the mic in their hand\nChinatown, Spokane, London, Tokyo\nWe on Award Tour with Muhammad my man\nGoing each and every place with the mic in their hand\nHouston, Delaware, DC, Dallas\nWe on Award Tour with Muhammad my man\nGoing each and every place with the mic in their hand\nNew York, NJ, NC, VA\n\nSeven times out of ten we listen to our music at night, thus spawned the title of this program\nThe word maraud means to loot\nIn this case, we maraud for ears", "image":

Award Tour with Muhammad my man\nGoing each and every place with the mic in their hand\nNew York, NJ, NC, VA\nWe on Award Tour with Muhammad my man\nGoing each and every place with the mic in their hand\nOaktown, LA, San Fran, St. John\n\nPeople give your ears so I be sublime\nIt's enjoyable to know you and your concubines\nNiggas, take off your coats, ladies act like gems\nSit down, Indian style, as we recite these hymns\nSee, lyrically I'm Mario Andretti on the MOMO\nLudicrously speedy, or infectious with the slow-mo\nHeard me in the eighties, J.B.'s on \"The Promo\"\nIn my never-ending quest to get the paper on the caper\nBut now, let me take it to the Queens side\nI'm taking it to Brooklyn side\nAll the residential Questers who invade the air\nHold up a second son, cause we almost there\nYou can be a black man and lose all your soul\nYou can be white and groove but don't crap the roll\nSee my shit is universal if you got knowledge of dolo\nOr delf or self, see there's no one else\nWho can drop it on the angle, acute at that\nSo, do that, do that, do do that that that (come on)\nDo that, do that, do do that that that (OK)\nDo that, do that, do do that that that\nI'm bugging out but let me get back cause I'm wetting niggas\nSo run and tell the others cause we are the brothers\nI learned how to build mics in my workshop class\nSo give me this award, and let's not make it the last\n\nWe on Award Tour with Muhammad my man\nGoing each and every place with the mic in their hand\nChinatown, Spokane, London, Tokyo\nWe on Award Tour with Muhammad my man\nGoing each and every place with the mic in their hand\nHouston, Delaware, DC, Dallas\n\nBack in '89 I simply slid in the place\nBuddy, buddy, buddy all up in your face\nA lot of kids was busting rhymes but they had no taste\nSome said Quest was wack, but now is that the case?\nI have a quest to have a mic in my hand\nWithout that, it's like Kryptonite and Superman\nSo Shaheed come in with the sugar cuts\nPhife Dawg's my name, but on stage, call me Dynomutt\nWhen was the last time you heard the Phife sloppy\nLyrics anonymous, you'll never hear me copy\nTop notch baby, never coming less\nSky's the limit, you gots to believe up in Quest\nSit back, relax, get up out the path\nIf not that, here's a dancefloor, come move that ass\nNon-believers, you can check the stats\nI roll with Shaheed and the brother Abstract\nNiggas know the time when Quest is in the jam\nI never let a statue tell me how nice I am\nComing with more hits than the Braves and the Yankees\nLiving mad phat like an oversized mampi\nThe wackest crews try to diss, it makes me laugh\nWhen my track record's longer than a DC-20 aircraft\nSo, next time that you think you want somethin' here\nMake something def or take that garbage to St. Elsewhere\n\nWe on Award Tour with Muhammad my man\nGoing each and every place with the mic in their hand\nSC, Maryland, New Orleans, Motown\nWe on Award Tour with Muhammad my man\nGoing each and every place with the mic in their hand\nChinatown, Spokane, London, Tokyo\nWe on Award Tour with Muhammad my man\nGoing each and every place with the mic in their hand\nHouston, Delaware, DC, Dallas\nWe on Award Tour with Muhammad my man\nGoing each and every place with the mic in their hand\nNew York, NJ, NC, VA\n\nSeven times out of ten we listen to our music at night, thus spawned the title of this program\nThe word maraud means to loot\nIn this case, we maraud for ears"}}, {"title": "Baby Phife's Return", "album": "Beats, Rhymes, and Life", "year": "1996-07-30", "lyrics": "The mad man Malik makes MCs run for Milk of Magnesia\nMaybe that'll ease ya\nMaster of this microphone mackin, master as in great\nI'll have your brain goin' in circles as my style tends to ovulate\nI'm makin' moves, never movies, that's why y'all MCs lose me\nRetrace, won't, so you're stubborn like groupies\nKid, you know my flava, tear this whole jam apart\nFuck around and have your heart, like Jordan had Starks'\nWhile you playin' hokey pokey, there's no time to be dokey\n'Cause I come out to play every night like Charles Oakley\nDissin' around with wack rhymin\nYou lose your grip from chalk climbin\nLet me take this time to say R.I.P. to Phyllis Hyman\nWho never got the props that she damn well deserved\nBut see me, you don't wanna see me, 'cause all MCs are gettin' served\nThe nerve, for you to even step to the Phifer\nI'll bumrush your set and crush your whole cypher\nReserve, a spot for me in hip hop's hall of fame\n'Cause rappin' ain't no game, big up your head and maintain\nYeah, Queens forever in this piece crushin' any beef\nAin't nuthin' sweet, the bakery's across the fuckin' street\nPhife Dawg, swingin' it back and forth just like Aaliyah\nMakin' moves on your heart like that trick Tamia\nNo doubt about it, I love hip hop to death\nBut yo Tip, bring in the chorus 'cause I'm losin' my breath\n\nAy yo, you know the deal when the diggy Dawg is on the scene\nWe got the fiend bumpin' straight from the borough Queens\nYou know the deal when the diggy Dawg is on the scene\nWe got the fiend bumpin' straight from the borough Queens\nYou know the deal when the diggy Dawg is on the scene\nYou know the deal, ha, you know the deal\n\nBig up pop Duke, that's where I caught my athleticism\nMy mama, no doubt, that's where I got my lyricism\nMy nana, that's where I got my spiritualism\nAs for Tip and Shah, they made me stop from smokin' izm\nNow, when I'm with some cheese, I be lettin' off gism\nWritin' rhymes since Daddy Kane and Biz Mark was on Prism\nI got a brave heart like the one named Shirley Chisholm\nAs for my late twin, boy, I wish I was with him\nGot the Lightro in the back talkin' bout (come on, get him)\nAnd when it comes to rhymes, no doubt, I flip em\nSucka MC in my path, hey main, I say we ship him\nMoney please, your rhymes are wack, say word, this geek is trippin'\nJust because my name is Phife, my man, I'm never slippin'\nI got the type of flave to have your ass straight bitchin'\nFor those who act cute, see I got them on mute\nHave you walkin' through your projects in your birthday suit\n'Cause your style is off loot, so I played him like a flute\nIf you's a sucka MC, then it's you I rebuke\nMy style is, everyday all day, similar to water\nCrushin' MCs as if my name was Sargent Slaughter\nKeep shit hotter...than a sauna\nOr better yet, the hormones on your Christian daughter\nHey, I tried to warn her\nMy sounds the type to kill, like the grill on Lauryn Hill\nSo all ya sucka MCs, y'all best go chill\nBout to go to Union Square so I can see my care bear\nSingin' good stuff in my ear, runnin' fingers through my hair\nRepresent the Zulu Nation with illy rap creations\nJust keep shit hotter than Death Row-Bad Boy confrontations\nChillin' with Fudge Love because he represents the Haitians\nYa naw'mean\n\nWord up\nI just wanna big up everybody for supportin' A Tribe Called Quest\nThrough the years\nThis be the fourth LP, you know what I'm sayin'?\nTip, Shaheed and Phife, Beats, Rhymes and Life\nFeaturing my man, you know what I'm sayin', Consequence\n192 is the area where we represent, for the ladies and gents, ha ha\nYou know what I'm sayin'? Big up Shaheed Muhammad, that's my man\nChristine, you know what I'm sayin, word life (fading out)\nThe Abstract Poetic, rockin' this track\nBouncin' it all over the place, in your face\nYou know what I'm sayin'?

have your brain goin' in circles as my style tends to ovulate\nI'm makin' moves, never movies, that's why y'all MCs lose me\nRetrace, won't, so you're stubborn like groupies\nKid, you know my flava, tear this whole jam apart\nFuck around and have your heart, like Jordan had Starks'\nWhile you playin' hokey pokey, there's no time to be dokey\n'Cause I come out to play every night like Charles Oakley\nDissin' around with wack rhymin\nYou lose your grip from chalk climbin\nLet me take this time to say R.I.P. to Phyllis Hyman\nWho never got the props that she damn well deserved\nBut see me, you don't wanna see me, 'cause all MCs are gettin' served\nThe nerve, for you to even step to the Phifer\nI'll bumrush your set and crush your whole cypher\nReserve, a spot for me in hip hop's hall of fame\n'Cause rappin' ain't no game, big up your head and maintain\nYeah, Queens forever in this piece crushin' any beef\nAin't nuthin' sweet, the bakery's across the fuckin' street\nPhife Dawg, swingin' it back and forth just like Aaliyah\nMakin' moves on your heart like that trick Tamia\nNo doubt about it, I love hip hop to death\nBut yo Tip, bring in the chorus 'cause I'm losin' my breath\n\nAy yo, you know the deal when the diggy Dawg is on the scene\nWe got the fiend bumpin' straight from the borough Queens\nYou know the deal when the diggy Dawg is on the scene\nWe got the fiend bumpin' straight from the borough Queens\nYou know the deal when the diggy Dawg is on the scene\nYou know the deal, ha, you know the deal\n\nBig up pop Duke, that's where I caught my athleticism\nMy mama, no doubt, that's where I got my lyricism\nMy nana, that's where I got my spiritualism\nAs for Tip and Shah, they made me stop from smokin' izm\nNow, when I'm with some cheese, I be lettin' off gism\nWritin' rhymes since Daddy Kane and Biz Mark was on Prism\nI got a brave heart like the one named Shirley Chisholm\nAs for my late twin, boy, I wish I was with him\nGot the Lightro in the back talkin' bout (come on, get him)\nAnd when it comes to rhymes, no doubt, I flip em\nSucka MC in my path, hey main, I say we ship him\nMoney please, your rhymes are wack, say word, this geek is trippin'\nJust because my name is Phife, my man, I'm never slippin'\nI got the type of flave to have your ass straight bitchin'\nFor those who act cute, see I got them on mute\nHave you walkin' through your projects in your birthday suit\n'Cause your style is off loot, so I played him like a flute\nIf you's a sucka MC, then it's you I rebuke\nMy style is, everyday all day, similar to water\nCrushin' MCs as if my name was Sargent Slaughter\nKeep shit hotter...than a sauna\nOr better yet, the hormones on your Christian daughter\nHey, I tried to warn her\nMy sounds the type to kill, like the grill on Lauryn Hill\nSo all ya sucka MCs, y'all best go chill\nBout to go to Union Square so I can see my care bear\nSingin' good stuff in my ear, runnin' fingers through my hair\nRepresent the Zulu Nation with illy rap creations\nJust keep shit hotter than Death Row-Bad Boy confrontations\nChillin' with Fudge Love because he represents the Haitians\nYa naw'mean\n\nWord up\nI just wanna big up everybody for supportin' A Tribe Called Quest\nThrough the years\nThis be the fourth LP, you know what I'm sayin'?\nTip, Shaheed and Phife, Beats, Rhymes and Life\nFeaturing my man, you know what I'm sayin', Consequence\n192 is the area where we represent, for the ladies and gents, ha ha\nYou know what I'm sayin'? Big up Shaheed Muhammad, that's my man\nChristine, you know what I'm sayin, word life (fading out)\nThe Abstract Poetic, rockin' this track\nBouncin' it all over the place, in your face\nYou know what I'm sayin'?

matter the cost)\n\n(Black) They don\u2019t make thugs of this caliber\n(Spasmodic) Who kept up the buzz the whole calendar\n(Black) Used to sell drugs out the Challenger\n(Spasmodic) Used to keep guns with the silencers\n(Black) They don\u2019t make thugs of this caliber\n(Spasmodic) Who kept up a buzz the whole calendar\n(Black) Used to sell drugs out the Challenger\n(Spasmodic) Now look what he does to any challenger\n\nNow who want it with the Trini gladiator?\nMid finger to you haters, you biters not innovators\nI take zero for granted, I honors my gift\nChampion pen game, plus I\u2019m freestyle equipped\nYou clowns be bum sauce, speak my name, it\u2019s curtains\nHamdulill\u0101h, my crew\u2019s back to workin'\nTrash rap the dead, pussy kill the chirping\nNo more fuck boys, sit down, shit can only get worse\nAnd how do you touch mic with flows uncertain?\nSpeak game dry, boy, that flow ain\u2019t workin'\nFolks throwin' items, them vex and cursin'\nFuck made me wanna see these niggas in person?\nThird song in, motherfuckers dispersin'\nOnly to realize Donald Juice in the buildin'\nBig tune this for man, woman, and children\nBack on my bullshit, Busta Bus' then we kill them\n\n(Black) They don\u2019t make thugs of this caliber\n(Spasmodic) Who kept up the buzz the whole calendar\n(Black) Used to sell drugs out the Challenger\n(Spasmodic) Used to keep guns with the silencers\n\nMy nigga spirit be talkin' to me, let me explain\nNot through evil mediums, tarot cards, and Ouija games\nBut through mixing chords and boards\nAnd even drum machines\u2014he be saying:\n\"Nigga fuck awards, keep reppin\u2019 Queens\"\nAnd don\u2019t be taking slack from these non-rapping niggas, man\nThat intellectual shit you spit, you better change your plan\nEspecially when you see 'em at the lobby of a label\nAnd they don\u2019t seem able to outstretch they hands\nAnd admit they fans\nYou better flame 'em in the J's that they standing in\nOstracize they memory for not remembering\nThe articles reduce their body parts to particles\nAnd dust the Dead Sea with their cremated molecules\nI\u2019m leaving, but nigga you still got the work to do\nI expect the best from you, I\u2019m watching from my heaven view\nDon\u2019t disappoint me, make sure that they anoint me\nAs the blue ribbon pedigree, the best of show, five-foot-three\nSpeak of the legacy for short people around the world\nNapoleonic, bionic people who cause the world to twirl\nRip every stage with grace, look right dead in they face\nLive the Tribe principle of havin' impeccable taste\nEnjoy that breath like that one was your last one left\nIf you don\u2019t believe me, Tip, there\u2019s truly life after death\nSo refer to the Biggie covers and shoutout my Trini brothers\nAnd please check in on my mother...\nMalik Izaak, call me shorty\"\n\n(Black) They don\u2019t make thugs of this caliber\n(Spasmodic) Who kept up the buzz the whole calendar\n(Black) Used to sell drugs out the

me on\n(Repeat x2)\n\nBonita Applebum remember way back whoo\nWhen you used to play with niggas in your pigtail do\nI used to be all on it like a fly on shit\nBack in the days, Bonita was a hit\nI flirted and I flirted 'til there was no end\nBut you kicked the diabolical and said we was friends\nHoney you was for me but I'm tired of that\nIt's three years later, I got a new rap\nGot a little older, a titbit wiser\nI gained twenty pounds, six inches higher\nSpeaking of high I saw you smoke a hootie mack\nYour ex-boyfriend claims he gets the booty back\nBut I'm here to testify it'll be a hard try\nSlapping my knees, letting out sighs\nWant to keep it slamming like a Hip Hop song\nBonita Applebum, you gotta put me on\n\n\nI'll never shed a tear but then again I won't steer\nYou wrong, I feel you strong, for affection steer here\nI'll take you to a place that's farther than the Uno\nWhat do you know, if we go to El Segundo\nYour presence should be closer like on \"Buddy\" I'll toast\nTo the ever clever youth to say the least you're the most\nHoney you're my honey, a-yo dip you're my dip\nTreasure and forever there'll be pleasure with Tip\nAs we glide and move\nCushioned like a pillow that's soft and smooth\nRicky D said we got to show and prove\nDo it to the music that's the raw butt groove\nIntimidate the boy\nCupid that's his name\nPicking all us suckers is his flipping game\nBut Tip don't fall for that\nInstead I'll get the Natives and we rush to the latest\nLambskin store, get a six-pack of hats for"}}, {"title": "Buggin' Out", "album": "The Low End Theory", "year": "1991-09-24", "lyrics": "Yo, microphone check one, two, what is this?\nThe five foot assassin with the roughneck business\nI float like gravity, never had a cavity\nGot more rhymes than the Winans got family\nNo need to sweat Arsenio to gain some type of fame\nNo shame in my game cause I'll always be the same\nStyles upon styles upon styles is what I have\nYou wanna diss the Phifer but you still don't know the half\nI sport New Balance sneakers to avoid a narrow path\nMess around with this you catch a size eight up your {ass}\nI never half step cause I'm not a half stepper\nDrink a lot of soda so they call me Dr. Pepper\nRefuse to compete with BS competition\nYour name ain't Special Ed\nSo won't you seckle with the mission\nI never walk the street thinking it's all about me\nEven though deep in my heart, it really could be\nI just try my best to like go all out\nSome might even say yo shorty black you're buggin' out\n\nZulu Nation, brothers last creation\nMinds get flooded, ejaculation\nRight on the two inch tape\nThe Abstract poet incognito, runs the cape\nNot the best not the worst and occasionally I curse\nTo get my point across, so bust, the floss\nAs I go in between, the grit and the dirt\nListen to the mission listen Miss as I do work, umm\nAs I crack the, monotone\nChildren of the jazz so, get your own\nSmokin R&B cause they try to do me\nOr the best of the pack but they can't do rap\nFor it's Abstract, original\nYou can't get your own and that's, pitiful\nI know I'd be the man if I cold yanked the plug\nOn R&B, but I can't and that's bugged\n\nBuggin' out, buggin' out, buggin' out, you're buggin' out\nBuggin' out, buggin' out, buggin' out, you're buggin' out\nBuggin' out, buggin' out, buggin' out, you're buggin' out\nBuggin' out, buggin' out, buggin' out, you're buggin' out\nBuggin' out, buggin' out, buggin' out, you're buggin' out\nBuggin' out, buggin' out, buggin' out, you're buggin' out\nBuggin' out, buggin' out, buggin' out, you're buggin' out\nBuggin' out, buggin' out, buggin' out, you're buggin' out\n\nYo when you bug out\nYou usually have a reason for the action\nSometimes you do it just for mere satisfaction\nPeople be hounding, always surrounding\nPulsing, just like a migraine pounding\nYou don't really fret, you stay in your sense\nCamouflage your feeling, of absolute tense\nYou soar off to another world, deep in your mind\nBut people seem to take that, as being unkind\n\"Oh yo he's acting stank,\" really on a regal?\nA man of the fame not a man of the people\nBelieve that if you wanna but I tell you this much\nRiding on the train with no dough, sucks\nOnce again a case of your feet in my Nike's\nIf a crowd is in my realm I'm saying -- mic please\nHip-hop is living, can't yank the plug\nIf you do the result, will end up kind of bugged\n\nYo, I am not an invalid although\nI used to smoke the weed out\nAli Shaheed Muhammad used to say I had to be out\nScheming on the cookies with the crazy booming back buns\nPushing on them real hard just so we can have the big fun\nWhen I left for road, see, I was Boulevard status\nBattling a MC was when Tip was at his maddest\nIt was one MC after one MC\nWhat the world could they be wanting see from little old me\nDo I have the formula to save the world?\nOr was it just because I used to\nSwipe the women and all the girls\nI'm the type of brother with the crazy extended hand, kid\nDissed by all my brothers I was all up what my man did\nSupposed to be my man\nBut now I wonder cause you're feeble\nI go out with the strongies and I separate the evils\nIt's your brain against my mind, for those about to boot out\nAll you nasty critters even though you see I bug out\n\nBuggin' out, buggin' out, buggin' out, you're buggin' out\nBuggin' out, buggin' out, buggin' out, you're buggin' out\nBuggin' out, buggin' out, buggin' out, you're buggin' out\nBuggin' out, buggin' out, buggin' out, you're buggin' out\nBuggin' out, buggin' out, buggin' out, you're buggin' out\nBuggin' out, buggin' out, buggin' out, you're buggin' out\nBuggin' out, buggin' out, buggin' out, you're buggin' out\nBuggin' out, buggin' out, buggin'

cavity\nGot more rhymes than the Winans got family\nNo need to sweat Arsenio to gain some type of fame\nNo shame in my game cause I'll always be the same\nStyles upon styles upon styles is what I have\nYou wanna diss the Phifer but you still don't know the half\nI sport New Balance sneakers to avoid a narrow path\nMess around with this you catch a size eight up your {ass}\nI never half step cause I'm not a half stepper\nDrink a lot of soda so they call me Dr. Pepper\nRefuse to compete with BS competition\nYour name ain't Special Ed\nSo won't you seckle with the mission\nI never walk the street thinking it's all about me\nEven though deep in my heart, it really could be\nI just try my best to like go all out\nSome might even say yo shorty black you're buggin' out\n\nZulu Nation, brothers last creation\nMinds get flooded, ejaculation\nRight on the two inch tape\nThe Abstract poet incognito, runs the cape\nNot the best not the worst and occasionally I curse\nTo get my point across, so bust, the floss\nAs I go in between, the grit and the dirt\nListen to the mission listen Miss as I do work, umm\nAs I crack the, monotone\nChildren of the jazz so, get your own\nSmokin R&B cause they try to do me\nOr the best of the pack but they can't do rap\nFor it's Abstract, original\nYou can't get your own and that's, pitiful\nI know I'd be the man if I cold yanked the plug\nOn R&B, but I can't and that's bugged\n\nBuggin' out, buggin' out, buggin' out, you're buggin' out\nBuggin' out, buggin' out, buggin' out, you're buggin' out\nBuggin' out, buggin' out, buggin' out,

you do it just for mere satisfaction\nPeople be hounding, always surrounding\nPulsing, just like a migraine pounding\nYou don't really fret, you stay in your sense\nCamouflage your feeling, of absolute tense\nYou soar off to another world, deep in your mind\nBut people seem to take that, as being unkind\n\"Oh yo he's acting stank,\" really on a regal?\nA man of the fame not a man of the people\nBelieve that if you wanna but I tell you this much\nRiding on the train with no dough, sucks\nOnce again a case of your feet in my Nike's\nIf a crowd is in my realm I'm saying -- mic please\nHip-hop is living, can't yank the plug\nIf you do the result, will end up kind of bugged\n\nYo, I am not an invalid although\nI used to smoke the weed out\nAli Shaheed Muhammad used to say I had to be out\nScheming on the cookies with the crazy booming back buns\nPushing on them real hard just so we can have the big fun\nWhen I left for road, see, I was Boulevard status\nBattling a MC was when Tip was at his maddest\nIt was one MC after one MC\nWhat the world could they be wanting see from little old me\nDo I have the formula to save the world?\nOr was it just because I used to\nSwipe the women and all the girls\nI'm the type of brother with the crazy extended hand, kid\nDissed by all my brothers I was all up what my man did\nSupposed to be my man\nBut now I wonder cause you're feeble\nI go out with the strongies and I separate the evils\nIt's your brain against my mind, for those about to boot out\nAll you nasty critters even though you see I bug out\n\nBuggin' out, buggin' out, buggin' out, you're buggin' out\nBuggin' out, buggin' out, buggin' out, you're buggin' out\nBuggin' out, buggin' out, buggin' out, you're buggin' out\nBuggin' out, buggin' out, buggin' out, you're buggin' out\nBuggin' out, buggin' out, buggin' out, you're buggin' out\nBuggin' out, buggin' out, buggin' out, you're buggin' out\nBuggin' out, buggin' out, buggin' out, you're buggin'

action\nWatch me roll with hon, try to push her back\nWhich one of these niggas, think they fuckin wit dis?\nPut your money on Queens, yo these cats is pissed\nMeanin hot green and stinky, see shorty there winkin?\nHit her off so hard, that her eyes start blinkin\nThen massage her down, with the word serene\nIt's the Dawg For Pres, new star on the scene\nAnd I'm here for the battle, right down to the letter\nIf it rains today, then it's a double-header\nRange Beemaz and Benz, 1100's and Jettas\nPhife Dawg for whatever, just get it together\n(Just) get it together\n(Just) get it together\n(Just) get it together\n\nJust get it together\nNo matter the weather, or where you at\nThis is how we gon' do it, cause we keep shit fat\nYou gotta\n(yo yo) do it (yo, yo yo) do it\n(yo yo) do it (yo, yo) do it\n(yo yo) do it (yo, yo yo) do it\n(yo yo) do it (yo, yo) do it\n* a lot of \"yo\" from Busta Rhymes *\n\nDidn't you read the news, did you heed the alarm\nIt was good overall, it said that we was the bomb\nI'mma make the call, and I hope you respond\nWe the stars y'all, and everyone beckons far\nYou a star and you shining, I'm one and I'm rhyming\nLet's get together, start intertwining\nYo you coming with me, somewhere where you can't see\nWith his bonafide joints, underneath the sea\nOf confusion and glitter, nobody's a quitter\nTry to front and get ripped, from your ear to your shitter\nGon' put it on harder than anyone did\nIt would benefit you to keep a wide open lid\nMakin sho' shot shit, makin sure you shine\nTakin shows for sure, takin hearts in time\nDo it all for the rhyme, and the rhythm and things\nWhen we do it we bangin, like we inside the bank\nAin't doubtin nobody, when we inside the jam\nBut I'm proud overall, and I know who I am\nAs the constellation gets brighter this writer's goin\n(yo yo) do it (yo, yo yo) do it\n(yo yo) do it (yo, yo) do it\n(yo yo) do it (yo, yo yo) do it\n(yo yo) do it (yo, yo) do it\n* continues with

"album": "The Low End Theory", "year": "1991-09-24", "lyrics": "1988 senior year at Garvey High\nWhere all the guys were corny but the girls were mad fly\nLounging with the Tipster, cooling with Sha\nScoping out the honeys\u2014they know who they are\nI was the b-ball playing, fly rhyme saying\nFly girl getting but never was I sweating\nCause when it came to honeys I would go on a stroll\nUntil I met my match\u2014her name was Flo\nYeah, I messed around with the one called Flo\nAll the troopers round the way used to call her a ho\nBut deep down in my heart I knew that Flo was good to go\nCause I thought it was me like Bell Biv Devoe\nBut little did I know that she was playing with my mind\nThe only thing I learned is good girls are hard to find\nI feel like Heavy D, I need somebody for me\nNot someone whose mind is blank and tryna juice me for my banks\nSwinging with my main man Lucky behind my back\nWhat type of crap is that\u2014yo, how's about a smack?\nWord life, I can't front, thought I was all that\nBut now it seems, I've met my match\nI was a stone cold lover, you couldn't tell me jack\nSettling down with one girl, wasn't trying to hear that\nI had Tonya, Tamika, Sharon, Karen\nTina, Stacy, Julie, Tracy\nUsed to love 'em, leave 'em, skeeze 'em, tease 'em\nFind 'em, lose 'em - also abuse 'em\nMy whole attitude was new day, next hon\nAnd believe it or not, they all got done\nWell here comes Flo, with the crazy whip appeal\nAnd I'm all true man, like Alexander O'Neal\nIs this really love, then again how would I know\nAfter all this time trying to be a super ho\nShe finally played me, but yo I'd find another\nCause I got the crazy game and yo, I'm smooth like butter\n\nAyo, it's like butter, it's like butter baby\nIt's like butter, it's like butter baby\nIt's like butter, it's like butter baby\nIt's like butter, it's like butter baby\nIt's like butter, it's like butter baby\nIt's like butter, it's like the butter baby\nNot no Parkay, not no margarine\nStrictly butter, strictly butter, baby\n\nI remember when girls were goodie two shoes but now they turning freaks\nAll of a sudden (we love you Phife!) ease off ho, my name's Malik\nPhife this, Phife that, where you going, where you at\nThese girls don't know me from jack, yet I feel like the Mack\nYou didn't want me then, so yo hon, don't want me now\nHere, Here - take the towel, wipe off your brow\nAnd take the contact out your eye, you're far from looking fly\nYou get an E for effort, and T for nice try\nNow tell me what's the reason, for dying your hair\nSlum village gold still dangling in your ear\nYou barely have a neck but still sporting a rope\nFour-finger ring just so Phifer can scope\nYou looked in the mirror, didn't know what to do\nYesterday your eyes were brown but today they are blue\nYour whole appearance is a lie and it could never be true\nAnd if you really liked yourself then you would try and be you\nIf your hair and eyes were real, I wouldn't have dissed ya\nBut since it was bought, I had to dismiss ya\nBut if you can't achieve it, then why not try and weave it\nIf you can't extend it then you might as well suspend it\nIf you can't braid it, best thing to do is fade it\nI asked who did your hair and you tell me, \"Diane made it\"\nIf you were you and just you, talk to you, maybe\nBut I can't stand, no bionic lady\nTrying hard to look fly, but yo, you're looking dumber\nIf I wanted someone like you I would've swung with Jaime Sommers\nYou wanna be treated right, see Father MC\nOr check Ralph Tresvant, for sensitivity\nCause I am not the one, I got more game than Parker Brothers\nPhife Dawg is on the mic and I'm smooth like butter", "image":

corny but the girls were mad fly\nLounging with the Tipster, cooling with Sha\nScoping out the honeys\u2014they know who they are\nI was the b-ball playing, fly rhyme saying\nFly girl getting but never was I sweating\nCause when it came to honeys I would go on a stroll\nUntil I met my match\u2014her name was Flo\nYeah, I messed around with the one called Flo\nAll the troopers round the way used to call her a ho\nBut deep down in my heart I knew that Flo was good to go\nCause I thought it was me like Bell Biv Devoe\nBut little did I know that she was playing with my mind\nThe only thing I learned is good girls are hard to find\nI feel like Heavy D, I need somebody for me\nNot someone whose mind is blank and tryna juice me for my banks\nSwinging with my main man Lucky behind my back\nWhat type of crap is that\u2014yo, how's about a smack?\nWord life, I can't front, thought I was all that\nBut now it seems, I've met my match\nI was a stone cold lover, you couldn't tell me jack\nSettling down with one girl, wasn't trying to hear that\nI had Tonya, Tamika, Sharon, Karen\nTina, Stacy, Julie, Tracy\nUsed to love 'em, leave 'em, skeeze 'em, tease 'em\nFind 'em, lose 'em - also abuse 'em\nMy whole attitude was new day, next hon\nAnd believe it or not, they all got done\nWell here comes Flo, with the crazy whip appeal\nAnd I'm all true man, like Alexander O'Neal\nIs this really love, then again how would I know\nAfter all this time trying to be a super ho\nShe finally played me, but yo I'd find another\nCause I got the crazy game and yo, I'm smooth like butter\n\nAyo, it's like butter, it's like butter baby\nIt's like butter, it's like butter baby\nIt's like butter, it's like butter baby\nIt's like butter, it's like butter baby\nIt's like butter, it's like butter baby\nIt's like butter, it's like the butter baby\nNot no Parkay, not no margarine\nStrictly butter, strictly butter, baby\n\nI remember when girls were goodie two shoes but now they turning freaks\nAll of a sudden (we love you Phife!) ease off ho, my name's Malik\nPhife this, Phife that, where you going, where you at\nThese girls don't know me from jack, yet I feel like the Mack\nYou didn't want me then, so yo hon, don't want me now\nHere, Here - take the towel, wipe off your brow\nAnd take the contact out your eye, you're far from looking fly\nYou get an E for effort, and T for nice try\nNow tell me what's the reason, for dying your hair\nSlum village gold still dangling in your ear\nYou barely have a neck but still sporting a rope\nFour-finger ring just so Phifer can scope\nYou looked in the mirror, didn't know what to do\nYesterday your eyes were brown but today they are blue\nYour whole appearance is a lie and it could never be true\nAnd if you really liked yourself then you would try and be you\nIf your hair and eyes were real, I wouldn't have dissed ya\nBut since it was bought, I had to dismiss ya\nBut if you can't achieve it, then why not try and weave it\nIf you can't extend it then you might as well suspend it\nIf you can't braid it, best thing to do is fade it\nI asked who did your hair and you tell me, \"Diane made it\"\nIf you were you and just you, talk to you, maybe\nBut I can't stand, no bionic lady\nTrying hard to look fly, but yo, you're looking dumber\nIf I wanted someone like you I would've swung with Jaime Sommers\nYou wanna be treated right, see Father MC\nOr check Ralph Tresvant, for sensitivity\nCause I am not the one, I got more game than Parker Brothers\nPhife Dawg is on the mic and I'm smooth like butter"}},

To all the people who can Quest like A Tribe does\nBefore this, did you really know what live was?\nComprehend to the track, for it's why cuz\nGettin measures on the tip of the vibers\nRock and roll to the beat of the funk fuzz\nWipe your feet really good on the rhythm rug\nIf you feel the urge to freak, do the jitterbug\nCome and spread your arms if you really need a hug\nAfrocentric living is a big shrug\nA life filled with fun that's what I love\nA lower plateau is what we're above\nIf you diss us, we won't even think of\nWill Nipper the doggy give a big shove?\nThis rhythm really fits like a snug glove\nLike a box of positives it's a plus, love\nAs the Tribe flies high like a dove\n(Can I kick it?)\n\nCan I kick it?

(Yes, you can!)\nWell, I'm gone (Go on then!)\n\nCan I kick it? To my Tribe that flows in layers\nRight now, Phife is a poem sayer\nAt times, I'm a studio conveyor\nMr. Dinkins, would you please be my mayor?\nYou'll be doing us a really big favor\nBoy this track really has a lot of flavor\nWhen it comes to rhythms, Quest is your savior\nFollow us for the funky behavior\nMake a note on the rhythm we gave ya\nFeel free, drop your pants, check your ha-ir\nDo you like the garments that we wear?\nI instruct you to be the obeyer\nA rhythm recipe that you'll savor\nDoesn't matter if you're minor or major\nYes, the Tribe of the game we're a player\nAs you inhale like a breath of fresh air\n(Can I kick it?)", "image": "https://images.genius.com/bb694d2329470f0f08852feacfb5a02a.600x600x1.jpg", "artist": "A Tribe Called Quest", "raw": {"annotation_count": 18, "api_path": "/songs/3021", "description": {"dom": {"tag": "root", "children": [{"tag": "p", "children": ["\u201cCan I Kick It?\u201d was the third single from A Tribe Called Quest\u2019s debut album ", {"tag": "em", "children": ["People\u2019s Instinctive Travels and the Paths of Rhythm"]}, "."]}, "", {"tag": "p", "children": ["The original version contains samples from ", {"tag": "a", "attributes": {"href": "https://genius.com/artists/Lou-reed"}, "data": {"api_path": "/artists/13277"}, "children": ["Lou Reed"]}, "\u2019s 1972 classic ", {"tag": "a", "attributes": {"href": "https://genius.com/Lou-reed-walk-on-the-wild-side-lyrics"}, "data": {"api_path": "/songs/86120"}, "children": ["\u201cWalk on the Wild Side,\u201d"]}, " ", {"tag": "a", "attributes": {"href": "https://genius.com/Dr-lonnie-smith-spinning-wheel-lyrics"}, "data": {"api_path": "/songs/2427990"}, "children": ["\u201cSpinning Wheel\u201d"]}, " by ", {"tag": "a", "attributes": {"href": "https://genius.com/artists/Dr-lonnie-smith"}, "data": {"api_path": "/artists/645008"}, "children": ["Dr. Lonnie Smith"]}, " and \u201c", {"tag": "a", "attributes": {"href": "https://genius.com/Dr-buzzards-original-savannah-band-sunshower-lyrics"}, "data": {"api_path": "/songs/831579"}, "children": ["Sunshower\""]}, " by \u201870s pop group ", {"tag": "a", "attributes": {"href": "https://genius.com/albums/Dr-buzzards-original-savannah-band/Dr-buzzard-s-original-savannah-band"}, "data": {"api_path": "/albums/164520"}, "children": ["Dr. Buzzard\u2019s Original Savannah Band."]}, "The numerous remixes sample everything from Baby Huey to ", {"tag": "a", "attributes": {"href": "https://genius.com/artists/Ian-dury"}, "data": {"api_path": "/artists/363981"}, "children": ["Ian Dury"]}, "."]}, "", {"tag": "hr"}, "", {"tag": "p", "children": [{"tag": "a", "attributes": {"href": "http://vevo.ly/If1EUd", "rel": "nofollow"}, "children": ["Peep the J Cole\u2019s Remix to this classic"]}, " for the 25th anniversary of their debut album.

Squirrel\nThe worst thing in the world is a sucker MC\nFavorite rap group in the world is EPMD\nCan't forget the De La, due to originality\nAnd if I ever went solo my favorite MC would be me\nPhife Dawg up in the house, I give a shout out to Snoopy\nPeace to all the Questers, to hell with the groupies\nLike um, Ralph Malph to Potsie, Brooklyn to Dodger\nLaverne to Shirley, Rerun to Roger\nRen to the Stimpy, Laurel to Hardy\nQ-Tip and Phife, they mash up the party\nKick the rhymes and more rhymes\nKick the beats and more beats\nWe'll have you scratching in your head like Shaheed on Technics\nFor those who wanna oppose then take a stand\nBut for now, just shut your shit and clap your hands\n\n\nYou just wanna dance man, then clap your hands\nIf you venture up the wrong road, then the circumstance\nWill be crucial, I got hundreds of rhymes that'll suit you\nSo listen\nThe Abstract intuition is very very worthy\nI can feel ya out from Russia to Jersey\nCan't understand the underground, it gets deep\nThe Lo, the Nikes, the links, the jeeps\nThe women, the lingo, and all the other goods\nPeace to the hoods, keep my shit on play\nPlease don't do the mute when you hear me on the juke\nBrothers know the angle, it's the Star-Spangled black banner\nHook up the beats at the funk manor\nIf you want a roll, then the dough I be raking\nThe scope is on the world cos it's mine for the taking\nYou know I'm gonna do it\nMy shit is rock solid, but it flows like fluid\nChemists get confused of my ill composition\nThis is the third of the new Tribe addition\nMCs be swinging, but a lot of them be missing\nSo shut your bloodclot and listen\nCuz I'm bringin you the ill rendition\nI'd like to send this out to the L.E.S\nGotta a lot of rhythm and style and finesse\nCome here love, hot sex on a plat\nAnd when you're done with that then clap\n - repeat until end\n\nKeep bouncing", "image": "https://images.genius.com/834f36c594ae7b665086945b4f31282a.300x298x1.jpg", "artist": "A Tribe Called Quest", "raw": {"annotation_count": 38, "api_path": "/songs/44669", "description": {"dom": {"tag": "root", "children": [{"tag": "p", "children": ["Track #9 off of the critically acclaimed ", {"tag": "em", "children": ["Midnight Marauders"]}, " album.

wrestler Zeus\nCrazier than 2Pac in the flick called Juice\nCock is longer than the hat worn by Dr. Seuss\nLove a girl in Daisy Dukes like them kids called Duice\nGets paid to sex the hoochie like my main man Luke\nControl the mic like Denzel on the girls\nWack MCs be on the nuts like Rocket J. Squirrel\nThe worst thing in the world is a sucker MC\nFavorite rap group in the world is EPMD\nCan't forget the De La, due to originality\nAnd if I ever went solo my favorite MC would be me\nPhife Dawg up in the house, I give a shout out to Snoopy\nPeace to all the Questers, to hell with the groupies\nLike um, Ralph Malph to Potsie, Brooklyn to Dodger\nLaverne to Shirley, Rerun to Roger\nRen to the Stimpy, Laurel to Hardy\nQ-Tip and Phife, they mash up the party\nKick the rhymes and more rhymes\nKick the beats and more beats\nWe'll have you scratching in your head like Shaheed on Technics\nFor those who wanna oppose then take a stand\nBut for now, just shut your shit and clap your hands\n\n\nYou just wanna dance man, then clap your hands\nIf you venture up the wrong road, then the circumstance\nWill be crucial, I got hundreds of rhymes that'll suit you\nSo listen\nThe Abstract intuition is very very worthy\nI can feel ya out from Russia to Jersey\nCan't understand the underground, it gets deep\nThe Lo, the Nikes, the links, the jeeps\nThe women, the lingo, and all the other goods\nPeace to the hoods, keep my shit on play\nPlease don't do the mute when you hear me on the juke\nBrothers know the angle, it's the Star-Spangled black banner\nHook up the beats at the funk manor\nIf you want a roll, then the dough I be raking\nThe scope is on the world cos it's mine for the taking\nYou know I'm gonna do it\nMy shit is rock solid, but it flows like fluid\nChemists get confused of my ill composition\nThis is the third of the new Tribe addition\nMCs be swinging, but a lot of them be missing\nSo shut your bloodclot and listen\nCuz I'm bringin you the ill rendition\nI'd like to send this out to the L.E.S\nGotta a lot of rhythm and style and finesse\nCome here love, hot sex on a plat\nAnd when you're done with that then clap\n - repeat until end\n\nKeep bouncing"}}, {"title": "Common Ground (Get It Goin' On)", "album": "The Love Movement", "year": "1998-09-29", "lyrics": "Q-Tip:\nWho that at the door?

(yeah uh huh uh uhuh, yeah uh huh)\nSo deep inside her life, she contemplated death (damn she deep, give a fella the creeps)\nCan't help but get attached to a woman like that (true that)(repeat 4X)\nThe contact was quite immediate, I had to attack\n(Because you the man, yo, you know you the man)\nWe related and debated over food and tunes\nStarted out in September, now we enterin June (say word)(repeat 4X)\nSimple night in the crib, no, it just won't do\n(no it just won't do, no it just won't do)\nBecause she liable to start shit too wild for you\n(wild for you, wild for...)\nShe wanna push my whip, buy diamond chips\nAnd take on trips, conversin my flip\nGotta do her hair, take her out to the fair\nWin a teddy bear, make sure you don't stare\nAt another one comin, don't be startin nuthin\nBe a slave to her, don't be brave to her\nMake sure that she's right, make sure that you're wrong\nWhen she wants it, do it, make sure that it's long\nIf anyone wanna make it work it's me (Phife Dawg help me out)(repeat 2X)\nBut we gotta come to a common ground baby\nAny man, he can claim to be the one for you\nBut put it straight to yourself and realize what's true\nChorus:\nAnd if it's me then let's get it going on (repeat 4X)\nGet it going on, let's get it going on\nAnd if it's me then let's get it going on (repeat 2X)\nQ-Tip:\nPhife Dawg in the break, is she more than you can take?\nPhife:\nSee, I'm not the one to be taken advantage of\nAnd if you really think about it, I got nuthin but love\nNow if your heart isn't in it, please let me know\nThere's no need to waste time, if it's no, then I'll go\nChorus:\nAnd if it's me then let's get it going on (repeat 4X)\nGet it going on, let's get it going on\nAnd if it's me then let's get it going on (repeat 2X)\nGet it going

kitten\nFlippin' on brothers just like Mary Lou Retton\nGet off that ass and see what I'm settin'\nBorn with this inside, you just can't get it\nThis is the lethal pop and you have no weapon\nWho is the native brother who keep asses steppin'\nMake deep impressions and constantly be reppin'\n\nWhen I was young I'd stretch gaucho\nNow I'm on Letterman, on the couch, yo\nThe black thing with knives is called the back do'\nCan't we be cool instead of being foul though\nGhetto child dreams of fast cars and fast dollars\nImpressions of live sometimes makes ya holler\nScream all that devil shit and talk like a scholar\nYou dumb as a doorknob, and why do you bother\n\nPhife Dawg puttin' the bite back in yours\nTop dog, puttin' it up, flick his balls\nMC from now til I get a frown\nShake that ass girl because you world renowned\nWake up, look at the sun, see the sights\nBull duke, you've got to die for your rights\nMC's, y'all got to work for the mic\nZombies, do it from dusk to the night\n2x\n\nRock to the beat, yo it's never the same\nGood girls usually got good game\nHot cats tearin' that ass out the frills\nBlock ass, you had no skills, that's the reals\nMake this money without the friction\nTake this honey, there goes your diction\nRappers better retreat, fix your joints\nMy whole crew got bumps on they points\n\nRumors being spread 'bout me and my click\nWe can't rock shows and our rhymes ain't shhh\nMight not've heard it, or maybe you have\nBetween me and you, they can kiss my ass\nUsed to get angry, used to get quite vexed\nBut say what you may, just cash my check\nCause all I'm ever guilty of is going on tour\nDoing shows galore, and bringin' it raw\n2x", "image": "https://images.genius.com/803048b1fbe57bda6dd3cf119eeda155.1000x1000x1.jpg", "artist": "A

promise to all y'all to keep my shit hittin'\nHalf of y'all claim dog but meow like kitten\nFlippin' on brothers just like Mary Lou Retton\nGet off that ass and see what I'm settin'\nBorn with this inside, you just can't get it\nThis is the lethal pop and you have no weapon\nWho is the native brother who keep asses steppin'\nMake deep impressions and constantly be reppin'\n\nWhen I was young I'd stretch gaucho\nNow I'm on Letterman, on the couch, yo\nThe black thing with knives is called the back do'\nCan't we be cool instead of being foul though\nGhetto child dreams of fast cars and fast dollars\nImpressions of live sometimes makes ya holler\nScream all that devil shit and talk like a scholar\nYou dumb as a doorknob, and why do you bother\n\nPhife Dawg puttin' the bite back in yours\nTop dog, puttin' it up, flick his balls\nMC from now til I get a frown\nShake that ass girl because you world renowned\nWake up, look at the sun, see the sights\nBull duke, you've got to die for your rights\nMC's, y'all got to work for the mic\nZombies, do it from dusk to the night\n2x\n\nRock to the beat, yo it's never the same\nGood girls usually got good game\nHot cats tearin' that ass out the frills\nBlock ass, you had no skills, that's the reals\nMake this money without the friction\nTake this honey, there goes your diction\nRappers better retreat, fix your joints\nMy whole crew got bumps on they points\n\nRumors being spread 'bout me and my click\nWe can't rock shows and our rhymes ain't shhh\nMight not've heard it, or maybe you have\nBetween me and you, they can kiss my ass\nUsed to get angry, used to get quite vexed\nBut say what you may, just cash my check\nCause all I'm ever guilty of is going on tour\nDoing shows galore, and bringin' it raw\n2x"}}, {"title":

Paul and John Wall in the league\nGrabbin' mics till the knuckles would bleed\n('Cause I believe\nThe potent that I'm quoting will have you geeked like speed)\nIf rationale is naturale or a weave\nIt's all edges and peas\nSettin' press, we on a permanent steeze\nI'm in a world where my princess is Leia\nAnd she's feeling my Vader\nAnd my lure grows greater and greater\nChem trails, droppin' poisonous vapors\nHave you shaking like Gator\nBeen trill, nigga, process the data\nBlu-ray, wave file, or a Beta, I'll DVR it for later\nKappo Masa with a G to my waiter\nYou can't define us, XY us, or Z us\nYou generational elitists\nHave your chi in virtual think pieces\n(See, these written words are poetical science\nBrain's defiant, thoughts heavy, baby\nThey're a major appliance)Leave a dent when drop with the flyness, fluent giant\nDude's nice, he tight, screwed in with some pliers\nCool with some buyers\nYeah, nigga, cool with some growers\n(Never no tattletales, only I don't knowers)\nWe a show me generation, show us what you gon' show us\nSo listen, mami, see we could collude with a boing\nMouthpiece like Goines, with a jubilant noise\nDudes rude and as useless as coins, shoot 'em boys\nVersed in, rehearsed in the soothing of loins\nTalk to Joey, Earl, Kendrick, and Cole, gatekeepers of flow\nThey are extensions of instinctual soulIt's the highest in commodity grade\nAnd you could get it today\n\nDis generation, dis generation, dis generation\nDis generation, dis generation, dis generation\nRules di nation\n\nOne hitting reading pages of Poe\nTelly is low, cuddle bunny ready to go\nDay of the dead\nBury all the zombies instead\nAnd it's just your aftermath, Busta cuttin' your dreads\nBruce Leein' niggas, while you niggas UFC\nSmoke tree on niggas, sizzle out your USB\n(Surge pricing on these Ubers, I'mma get me a cab)\nYo, where Jarobi at?\nImbibing on impeccable grass\nI be in NYC waiting for that law to pass\n(Pass shit, been waiting for a Jet's title since last\nRichard Todd, Todd Bowles, gang green on that ass)\nMagic Mike on the mic, David Blaine, Douglass Henning\nIn the church of Busta Rhymes, it's my sermon you're getting\nHorizontal spittin', I'm the exorcist of your writtens\nDon't interrupt me, nigga, sorry, that's a sin unforgivenLike how we be skipping on beats like cooking crack in the kitchen\nB-b-b-b-b-b-but wait\nJust spit the package, dry it, bag up the wet\nThis mad city's not a game, easy, quiet on set, Phife\n(Student of the past trailblazing a daze\nNot acknowledging a trend or swept up in a phase\nWe still the highest of commodity grade\nAnd you could get it, get it, get it, get it today)\n\nDis generation, dis generation, dis generation\nDis generation, dis generation, dis generation\nRules di nation\n\nThis is our generation, generation, uh huh, yeah\nThis our generation, generation, uh huh\nThis our generation, generation, uh huh"}}, {"title": "Ego", "album": "We

trippin'\nEgo, ego\nI got one, you got one, and now we equal\nSometimes it makes you trip out on your people\nSometimes it has connotations of evil\nSometimes niggas call on it when they need to\nIt's called the ego\n\nAy, it's hard to really make the subject positively stated\nSome may hate it and some may overrate it\nIt's a top story and you rarely see a trend\nSo all you psychoanalysts, pull out your pad and pen\nIt's called the ego\nCome up with an idea, and no one seems to get it\nThen every time you mention it\nThey stare like you're two-headed\nBut one day, in your cubicle, your idea really comes to view\nYour boss is walking by, he sees it too and he takes it from you\nShe put you on the aces of all the stripper places\nAnd has the kinda clientele where niggas trick off very well\nYou beg her and you plead her and you tuck away your ego\nShe knows you need the chicken\nAnd you know that she's your people\nThey call you fat and lazy, your commentary crazy\nThey photoshop your face on a box of McCormick gravy\nAnd now that inner voice, that ego, making you get wavy\nChange your diet, hit the gym\nAnd say, \"What were you saying to me?\"\nThe ego makes you do it, it makes you face the music\nOr run away from life so fast that you'll outsprint Carl Lewis\nIt has you think your deceptive ways of being are the truest\nHad the prettiest brown eyes but you change them shits to the bluest\nIt's the ego\n\nOoo, Jack White\nOoo, Jack White\n\nA celebrated genius, my dick game is the meanest\nI'll take the girl that's augmented, new me is invented\nI'll take the biggest house in Calabassas\nAnyone for Michael Phelps swimming classes?\nYou need it when you're balling, equally when you're falling\nOr when those kids in school on your locker\nThey get to scrawling\nEpithets that's racist is stupid and mean in nature\nSomething that can make you feel stronger when people hate ya\nEgo make you violent or govern like a tyrant\nOr switch a dictionary's word from vibrant to vivrant\nFool the thirsty people, selling tap water in bottles\nFooled a girl with NYU scholarship and now she models\nEgo has no ending, has people pretending\nReligious zealots get jealous 'cause guys want their defending\nThis is the last Tribe and our ego hopes that you felt us\nAnd closing for our ego, we know only God can help us\n\nEgo, ego skippin', trippin' in my

in my mind\nEgo, ego trippin', trippin', trippin', trippin', trippin'\nEgo, ego\nI got one, you got one, and now we equal\nSometimes it makes you trip out on your people\nSometimes it has connotations of evil\nSometimes niggas call on it when they need to\nIt's called the ego\n\nAy, it's hard to really make the subject positively stated\nSome may hate it and some may overrate it\nIt's a top story and you rarely see a trend\nSo all you psychoanalysts, pull out your pad and pen\nIt's called the ego\nCome up with an idea, and no one seems to get it\nThen every time you mention it\nThey stare like you're two-headed\nBut one day, in your cubicle, your idea really comes to view\nYour boss is walking by, he sees it too and he takes it from you\nShe put you on the aces of all the stripper places\nAnd has the kinda clientele where niggas trick off very well\nYou beg her and you plead her and you tuck away your ego\nShe knows you need the chicken\nAnd you know that she's your people\nThey call you fat and lazy, your commentary crazy\nThey photoshop your face on a box of McCormick gravy\nAnd now that inner voice, that ego, making you get wavy\nChange your diet, hit the gym\nAnd say, \"What were you saying to me?\"\nThe ego makes you do it, it makes you face the music\nOr run away from life so fast that you'll outsprint Carl Lewis\nIt has you think your deceptive ways of being are the truest\nHad the prettiest brown eyes but you change them shits to the bluest\nIt's the ego\n\nOoo, Jack White\nOoo, Jack White\n\nA celebrated genius, my dick game is the meanest\nI'll take the girl that's augmented, new me is invented\nI'll take the biggest house in Calabassas\nAnyone for Michael Phelps swimming classes?\nYou need it when you're balling, equally when you're falling\nOr when those kids in school on your locker\nThey get to scrawling\nEpithets that's racist is stupid and mean in nature\nSomething that can make you feel stronger when people hate ya\nEgo make you violent or govern like a tyrant\nOr switch a dictionary's word from vibrant to vivrant\nFool the thirsty people, selling tap water in bottles\nFooled a girl with NYU scholarship and now she models\nEgo has no ending, has people pretending\nReligious zealots get jealous 'cause guys want their defending\nThis is the last Tribe and our ego hopes that you felt us\nAnd closing for our ego, we know only God can help us\n\nEgo, ego skippin', trippin' in my mind\nEgo, ego skippin', trippin' in my mind\nEgo, ego trippin', trippin', trippin', trippin', trippin'\nEgo, ego skippin', trippin' in my mind\nEgo, ego skippin', trippin' in my mind\nEgo, ego trippin', trippin', trippin', trippin', trippin'\nEgo, ego skippin', trippin' in my mind\nEgo, ego skippin', trippin' in my mind"}}, {"title": "Electric Relaxation", "album": "Midnight Marauders", "year": "1993-11-09", "lyrics": "Relax yourself girl, please set-tle down\nRelax yourself girl, please set-tle down\nRelax yourself girl, please set-tle down\nRelax yourself girl, please set-tle down\n\nHoney, check it out, you got me mesmerized\nWith your black hair and your fat-ass thighs\nStreet poetry is my everyday\nBut yo, I gotta stop when you trot my way\nIf I was working at the club you would not pay\nAyo, my man Phife Diggy, he got something to say\n\nI like 'em brown, yellow, Puerto Rican or Haitian\nName is Phife Dawg from the Zulu Nation\nTold you in the jam that we can get down\nNow let's knock the boots like the group H-Town\nYou got BBD all on your bedroom wall\nBut I'm above the rim and this is how I ball\nA gritty little something on the New York street\nThis is how I represent over this here beat\nTalking 'bout you\n\nYo, I took you out\nBut sex was on my mind for the whole damn route\nMy mind was in a frenzy and a horny state\nBut I couldn't drop dimes cause you couldn't relate\n\nRelax yourself girl, please set-tle down\nRelax yourself girl, please set-tle down\nRelax yourself girl, please set-tle down\nRelax yourself girl, please set-tle down\n\nStretch out your legs, let me make you bawl\nDrive you insane, drive you up the wall\nStaring at your dome-piece, very strong\nStronger than pride, stronger than Teflon\nTake you on the ave and you buy me links\nNow I wanna pound the poontang until it stinks\nYou can be my mama and I'll be your boy\n\nOriginal rude boy, never am I coy\nYou can be a shorty in my ill convoy\nNot to come across as a thug or a hood\nBut hon, you got the goods, like Madelyne Woods\nBy the way, my name's Malik\nThe Five-Foot Freak\nLet's say we get together by the end of the week\nShe simply said, \"No\", labelled me a ho\nI said, \"How you figure?\" \"My friends told me so\"\nI hate when silly groupies wanna run they yap\nWord to God, hon, I don't get down like that\n\nI'll have you weak in the knees that you could hardly speak\nOr we could do like Uncle L and swing an ep in my jeep\nKeep it on the down, yo, we keep it discreet\nSee, I'm not the type of kid to have my biz in the streets\n\nIf my mom don't approve, then I'll just elope\nLet me save the little man from inside the boat\nLet me hit it from the back, girl I won't catch a hernia\nBust off on your couch, now you got Seaman's Furniture\n\nShaheed, Phife and the Extra P\nStacy Beadle, PJ and my man L.G\nThey know the Abstract is really soul on ice\nThe character is of men, never ever of mice\nShorty let me tell you about my only vice\nIt has to do with lots of loving and it ain't nothing nice\n\nRelax yourself girl, please set-tle

it out, you got me mesmerized\nWith your black hair and your fat-ass thighs\nStreet poetry is my everyday\nBut yo, I gotta stop when you trot my way\nIf I was working at the club you would not pay\nAyo, my man Phife Diggy, he got something to say\n\nI like 'em brown, yellow, Puerto Rican or Haitian\nName is Phife Dawg from the Zulu Nation\nTold you in the jam that we can get down\nNow let's knock the boots like the group H-Town\nYou got BBD all on your bedroom wall\nBut I'm above the rim and this is how I ball\nA gritty little something on the New York street\nThis is how I represent over this here beat\nTalking 'bout you\n\nYo, I took you out\nBut sex was on my mind for the whole damn route\nMy mind was in a frenzy and a horny state\nBut I couldn't drop dimes cause you couldn't relate\n\nRelax yourself girl, please set-tle down\nRelax yourself girl, please set-tle down\nRelax yourself girl, please set-tle down\nRelax yourself girl, please set-tle down\n\nStretch out your legs, let me make you bawl\nDrive you insane, drive you up the wall\nStaring at your dome-piece, very strong\nStronger than pride, stronger than Teflon\nTake you on the ave and you buy me links\nNow I wanna pound the poontang until it stinks\nYou can be my mama and I'll be your boy\n\nOriginal rude boy, never am I coy\nYou can be a shorty in my ill convoy\nNot to come across as a thug or a hood\nBut hon, you got the goods, like Madelyne Woods\nBy the way, my name's Malik\nThe Five-Foot Freak\nLet's say we get together by the end of the week\nShe simply said, \"No\", labelled me a ho\nI said, \"How you figure?\" \"My friends told me so\"\nI hate when silly groupies wanna run they yap\nWord to God, hon, I don't get down like that\n\nI'll have you weak in the knees that you could hardly speak\nOr we could do like Uncle L and swing an ep in my jeep\nKeep it on the down, yo, we keep it discreet\nSee, I'm not the type of kid to have my biz in the streets\n\nIf my mom don't approve, then I'll just elope\nLet me save the little man from inside the boat\nLet me hit it from the back, girl I won't catch a hernia\nBust off on your couch, now you got Seaman's

enough?\nEnough, enough, enough\n\nYo, I'm savant with the game\nGon' tell Robi yo' name\nProvide words that's heard, setting your body aflame\nOoh, you off the chain, I'm handling your terrain\nYour valley h-has me standing down to the follicle\n'Bout half of this bottle full of reasons for us to ball\nPalming violations and travel vacation, ma\nLace your fancy bra, gon' take them vestments off\nSkin and my lips involved, I'm licking a place that's soft\nJedi\n\nIs this enough?\nIs this enough love that I give to you?\nIs this enough?\nIs this enough time that I give to you?\nIs this enough?\nTell me that you feel the same way I do\nIs this enough?\nEnough, enough, enough\n\nIs it an issue if I make you nut?\nBut there's no quality time 'cause I forever grind\nThis is not an excuse, I just wanna get loose\nThat's old nigga jargon, girl, you're making me hardened\nTo a stone or granite statue, I'm prone to get at you\nIt's hard to break your defense, I guess I have to leap fence\nOr scale wall, and break fall on a tree right by your window\nReward me for my efforts by rolling this indo\nAs I nibble your neck naughtily, sex is a big part of me\nAgencies want to audit me, searching, snooping for sodomy\nMy thrust bust artery, I know you're on to me\nJust wanna have shenanigan\nDon't wanna make you mad again\nSo focus on the flattery you feel when I fling it\nAcknowledge that I got it and you love it when I bring it\nDirty talk loud but they saying, \"Fuck the shit out of me\"\nAt the Queen's request, if it's gotta be, it's gotta be\n\nIs this enough?\nIs this enough love that I give to you?\nIs this enough?\nIs this enough time that I give to you?\nIs this enough?\nTell me that you feel the same way I do\nIs this enough?\nIs this enough?\nIs this enough love that I give to you?\nIs this enough?\nIs this enough time that I give to you?\nIs this enough?\nTell me that you feel the same way I do\nIs this enough?"}}, {"title":

is fair when you're livin' in the city\nEverything is fair when you're livin' in the city\nEverything is fair when you're livin' in the city\nEverything is fair when you're livin' in the city\nEverything is fair when you're livin' in the city\nEverything is fair when you're livin' in the city\n\nLook at Miss Elaine who runs the fast lane\nBarely knows her name, struck by fame\nShe just got a Benz, she rides with her friends\nGotta keep her beeper in her purse to make ends\nRollin' down the block, checkin' out the spots\nShe winks at the cops, always give her props\nShe knows she's the woman, can't nobody touch her\nHangs out for the loot, makes her papes from the gutter\nTried to make my moves on Miss Elaine, she called me young boy\nTold her not to diss me I just want to be your love toy\nYou young boy, my love toy, I doubt that very highly\nJust because you rhyme don't mean I'll let you try me\nBusiness oriented, egos never dented\nAlways sweet scented, if it's business, she meant it\nDistractions never hurt, always did the work\nAlways was alert, she never got jerked\nQueen of the feats, thrive to compete\nLove the funky beats while she drove down the street\nShe was justified, couldn't get a job\nHad to feed her family, so she had to play the mob\nPullin' out the oowop, listenin' to doo-wop\n(You don't have to say a word)\n(*gunshots*) That's all ya heard\n\nEverything is fair when you're livin' in the city\nEverything is fair when you're livin' in the city\nEverything is fair when you're livin' in the city\nEverything is fair when you're livin' in the city\n\nShe's not a big kahuna, wish I met her sooner\nInstead, I met her later, my love is much greater\nPut me on her roster to rid her of imposters\nAnd to sell the buddah for the sexy drug ruler\nLove is my motive, now I'm drug promotive\nPlus I needed ducats to fill up my buckets\nSupplied me with the squeezy to make my life easy\nNow I'm missing action for this fatal attraction\nBut don't you let me catch you with your joint up in these bitches\nAnd don't you even dare to plan a plot upon my riches\n'Cause if you play me out, I think I'll let ya be\nI'll be damned if I let a brotha try to gas me\nI played my cards well, try to live swell\nFor the G, I would sell, 'cause I was deep in hell\nBut then I really wasn't, she had a fly cousin\nWho would give me booty on the side of my cutie\nElaine, she kinda knew, that I would do the do\nBut she didn't tear, I did my work with care\nThat's all that really mattered, her money never splattered\nAs long as she was paid, she was in the shade\nYou can't really blame her for holdin' on a flamer\nSociety taught her, but they didn't tame her\nA ten clip salute, hunny here's a troop\nShe will never stop until she reach the top\nTop, top...", "image": "https://images.genius.com/a20a6e62f3cac5b33c6ac2c5a6ae57e1.1000x1000x1.png", "artist": "A Tribe Called Quest", "raw": {"annotation_count": 33, "api_path":

is fair when you're livin' in the city\nEverything is fair when you're livin' in the city\nEverything is fair when you're livin' in the city\nEverything is fair when you're livin' in the city\nEverything is fair when you're livin' in the city\nEverything is fair when you're livin' in the city\n\nLook at Miss Elaine who runs the fast lane\nBarely knows her name, struck by fame\nShe just got a Benz, she rides with her friends\nGotta keep her beeper in her purse to make ends\nRollin' down the block, checkin' out the spots\nShe winks at the cops, always give her props\nShe knows she's the woman, can't nobody touch her\nHangs out for the loot, makes her papes from the gutter\nTried to make my moves on Miss Elaine, she called me young boy\nTold her not to diss me I just want to be your love toy\nYou young boy, my love toy, I doubt that very highly\nJust because you rhyme don't mean I'll let you try me\nBusiness oriented, egos never dented\nAlways sweet scented, if it's business, she meant it\nDistractions never hurt, always did the work\nAlways was alert, she never got jerked\nQueen of the feats, thrive to compete\nLove the funky beats while she drove down the street\nShe was justified, couldn't get a job\nHad to feed her family, so she had to play the mob\nPullin' out the oowop, listenin' to doo-wop\n(You don't have to say a word)\n(*gunshots*) That's all ya heard\n\nEverything is fair when you're livin' in the city\nEverything is fair when you're livin' in the city\nEverything is fair when you're livin' in the city\nEverything is fair when you're livin' in the city\n\nShe's not a big kahuna, wish I met her sooner\nInstead, I met her later, my love is much greater\nPut me on her roster to rid her of imposters\nAnd to sell the buddah for the sexy drug ruler\nLove is my motive, now I'm drug promotive\nPlus I needed ducats to fill up my buckets\nSupplied me with the squeezy to make my life easy\nNow I'm missing action for this fatal attraction\nBut don't you let me catch you with your joint up in these bitches\nAnd don't you even dare to plan a plot upon my riches\n'Cause if you play me out, I think I'll let ya be\nI'll be damned if I let a brotha try to gas me\nI played my cards well, try to live swell\nFor the G, I would sell, 'cause I was deep in hell\nBut then I really wasn't, she had a fly cousin\nWho would give me booty on the side of my cutie\nElaine, she kinda knew, that I would do the do\nBut she didn't tear, I did my work with care\nThat's all that really mattered, her money never splattered\nAs long as she was paid, she was in the shade\nYou can't really blame her for holdin' on a flamer\nSociety taught her, but they didn't tame her\nA ten clip salute, hunny here's a troop\nShe will never stop until she reach the top\nTop, top..."}}, {"title": "Excursions", "album": "The Low End Theory", "year": "1991-09-24", "lyrics": "Back in the days when I was a teenager\nBefore I had status and before I had a pager\nYou could find the Abstract listenin' to hip-hop\nMy pops used to say, it reminded him of Bebop\nI said, \"Well, Daddy, don't you know that things go in cycles?\nWay that Bobby Brown is just amping like Michael\"\nIt's all expected, things are for the lookin'\nIf you got the money, Quest is for the bookin'\nCome on everybody, let's get with the fly mode\nStill got room on the truckload of black boom\nListen to the rhymes, then get a mental picture\nOf this black man, and black woman fixture\nWhy do I say that? 'Cause I gotta speak the truth, man\nDoin' what we feel for the music is the proof, and\nPlanted on the ground, the act is so together\nBona fide strong, you need leverage to sever\nThe unit, yes, the unit, yes, the unit called the jazz is\nDelivering each year an LP filled with street goods\nYou can find it on your rack in your record store\nIf you get the record, say your thoughts are adored\nAnd appreciated, 'cause we're ever so glad we made it\nWe work hard, so we gotta thank God\nDishin' out the plastic, do the dance till you're spastic\nIf you diss\u2014it gets drastic\nListen to the rhyme, 'cause it's time to make gravy\nIf it moves your booty, then shake, shake it, baby\nAll the way to Africa, A.K.A. the Motherland\nStick out the left, then I'll ask for the other hand\nThat's the right hand, Black man\nOnly if you are noted as my man\nIf I get the credit, then I think I deserve it\nIf you fake moves, don't fix your mouth to word it\nGet in the zone of positivity, not negativity\n'Cause we gotta strive for longevity\nIf you botch up, what's in that \n(What?) A pair of Nikes, size ten-and-a-half\n\nWe gotta make moves (words)\nNever, ever, ever could we fake moves (come on, come on)\nWe gotta make moves (words)\nNever, ever, ever could we fake moves (come on, come on)\nWe gotta make moves\nNever, ever, ever could we fake moves (come on, come on)\nWe gotta make moves\nNever, ever, ever could we fake moves (come on, come on)\n\n\"Time, time is a ship on a merciless sea\nDrifting toward an abyss of nothingness\nUntil it can be recharted for its own destiny\nTime is an inanimate object paying and paying and paying for no justification for belief\nTime is dancing, boogalooing-away all memories of past\u2014\"\n\nWe gotta be a winner all the time\nCan't fall prey to a hip-hop crime\nWith the dope raps and dope tracks we move blocks\nFrom the fly girlies to the hardest of the rocks\nMusically the Quest, is on the rise\nWe on these excursions so you must realize\nThat continually, I pop my Zulu \nIf you don't like it, get off the Zulu tip\nSo what can you do in the times which exist\nYou can't fake moves on your brother or your sis\nBut if your sis is a , brother is a jerk\nLeave 'em both alone and continue with your work\nWhatever it may be in today's society\nEverything is fair, least that's how it seems to me\nYou must be honest and true to the next\nDon't be phony and expect one not to flex\nEspecially if you rhyme, you have to live by the pen\nYour man is your man, then treat him like your friend\nAll it is, is the code of the streets\nSo listen to the knowledge being dropped over beats\nBeats that are hard, beats that are funky\nThey could get you hooked like a crackhead junkie\nWhat you gotta do is know the Tribe is in the sphere\nThe Abstract Poet, prominent like Shakespeare\n(Or Edgar Allan Poe, or Langston Hughes, or...)\n\nWe gotta make moves\nNever, ever, ever could we fake moves (come on, come on)\nWe gotta make moves\nNever, ever, ever could we fake moves (come on, come on)\nWe gotta make moves\nNever, ever, ever could we fake moves (come on, come on)\nWe gotta make moves\nNever, ever, ever could we fake moves (come on, come on)\n\n\"\u2014time is running out on black power advocates in the day and white thighed supporters at night\nEvery time you see them, they're chasin' some white woman with their tongue hangin' out\nTime is running and passing, passing and running, running and passing,

said, \"Well, Daddy, don't you know that things go in cycles?\nWay that Bobby Brown is just amping like Michael\"\nIt's all expected, things are for the lookin'\nIf you got the money, Quest is for the bookin'\nCome on everybody, let's get with the fly mode\nStill got room on the truckload of black boom\nListen to the rhymes, then get a mental picture\nOf this black man, and black woman fixture\nWhy

hush\nThe whole world sees it but you can't (uh)\nMy peoples they complain, sit and rave and rant (come on)\nYour name is out my mouth like an ancient chant (say what?)\nGot me like a dog as I pause and pant...\n\nSpeaking of which, got a leash and I wish just to rock you miss (come on)\nMake a militant move, peep my strategy (what?)\nEnd of the day you're not mad at me (uh)\nNot dealing with nobody, now that's what you told me (what?)\nI said: \"hey yo, it's cool, we can just be friendly\" (come on)\nCause yo, picture me messing it up\nHer mind not corrupt, with the ill C-Cups\nShit, I'm on my J.O. (come on)\nBullshitting, hoping that the day goes slow (what?)\nGot me like a friend, what confuses me though\nIs kisses when we breeze, tell me what's the deal yo? (deal yo, yo, yo...)\n\nNow you caught my heart for the evening\nKissed my cheek, moved in, you confuse things\nShould I just sit out or come harder?\nHelp me find my way\nNow you caught my heart for the evening\nKissed my cheek, moved in, you confuse things\nShould I just sit out or come harder?\nHelp me find my way\n\nNow why you wanna go and do that, love, huh?\nMaking things for me towards you harder\nKilling me, just when I think we're there\nYou douse the whole vibe and the flows in the air\nTelling me 'bout next man\nBut next man ain't the nigga with the plan\nWho got your heart in mind?\nIt's about time that you just unwind (come on)\n\nAnd let it just happen, make it front-free (uh)\nJust sweat me like Moneypenny (uh)\nDigging you, getting inside of your stee (what?)\nIt's the Quest cat keeping you company\nForever, or however you want it\n\nWord word, now wait a minute Ma before you jet into the curb (yeah, yeah)\nStart to make affections, which is good not the herb\nBut it, it ain't me, and I, I ain't blurred (uh)\nI'mma still just chill with you\nMaybe things could change if you change your view (come on)\nIf not then I guess it is cool (yeah)\nJust, to keep to yourself and abide by the rules, right\nCheck it out now...\nCheck it out now...\nLike that now...\nCheck it out now...\nWha wha now...\nCheck it out now...\nYeah yeah now...\nCheck it out now...\nCheck it out now...\nIt's like that now...\nCheck it out now...\nYeah yeah now...\nCheck it out now...\nWhat you say, what?

start trudging, me and my brothers we be looking and be bugging\nVehicles of life they be rolling and be nudging\nSearching for the virgins of life\nThat be shoving out the door that's crack\nThe valleys of time, are always on my feet\nAs least the beat will combine\nThe calluses and corns with the funky bassline\nYou don't need Underdog for a nickel shoeshine or the shoes that's phat\nWell can I get a level on the bass and on the treble\nFooting up and down like a UNLV Rebel\nThe answer be amongst us cos we rarely dig acoustics\nCan't be too much flacking, not too much packing\nYou must container that at least to dip your hand in rap\nYour feet will be infectious so at least realise the fact\nThe rhythms are inserted and the nurse can be converted\nThis ain't rock 'n' roll cos the rap is in control\nIf you're a megastar, worth will buy you a car\nI'd rather go barefooting, for prints I will be putting\nAll over the earth if we can get there first\nNow that we are in it, footprints are being printed\nSo if you recognize em, you can try to size em\nThey'll probably be the ones with the size not frying\nAll over reveal, you won't have to yield\nIf you want protection you can hide behind the shield\n\nYou can game on the gallons if you really need to rock\nBut we walk while we talk as we stomping through the block\nHand in hand 'cross the land as Muhammad cross the fade\nIt's a Tribe who meanders, precious like a jade\nIt's a art, Theo arch rhymes the ground placed upon\nThe mind will unwind, it will soft to beyond\nCatch the track, track by track, get a map to track a trail\nYou will find yourself behind for a map does not prevail\nSee the levels peaking as the rhythms keep-a screeching\nA Quest, oh yes a Quest, inside the jam I will keep preaching\nThe point, oh yes the point, because it's close but yet so far\nThe loudiness is ringing as we scoot across the star\nWe are bulging, I'm indulging in a rat-a-tat-tat\nExplanation for the liners that the rhythm is phat\nKeep it wild, wide and deep, you could dig it in a jeep\nBut dig it in the ground because the foot print now\n\nIf there's a storm that's brewing, it won't keep us from doing\nOur thing as we start swinging, travelling is bringing\nJoy inside the domes as we hit the road to roam/Rome\nA chair is not a chair, a house is not a home\nBecause my skin is brown, yo I'm gonna do the town\nRub it in the face and rub my feet all through the place\nWhen you get your finger on the music it'll linger\nSing a song o' sixpence, sing it like a singer\nA Nubian, a Nubian, a proud one at that\nRemember me, the brother who said \"Black is black\"\nYou can come by request, I don't play, I don't dress\nGet emotions off your chest, we are black, we the best\nMaking moves, making motions, flowing like an ocean\nThe walking will continue, we know that we will bring you\nThe times that you have waited, more anticipated\nBe gone but not for long because the feet will stay strong"}},

Steve\nLike Georgie, why can't money find a honey\nI couldn't believe when I found out he was funny\nYou know fierce with just his right ear pierced\nI couldn't hack it, I knew this brother for years\nWalking in the ville with them long dreadlocks\nBut on the DL, getting done up the butt box\nOh my God how gross can one be\nWell anyway, better him than me\nUsed to be down with the crew and had the girls that were def\nInstead of staying to the right, he fell off to the left\nSo Lord J being that you go next\nPull the rest of his card cause I'm vexed\n\nMy man George got a germ that's ill\nSuffering from terminal scag\nBut never ever getting caught walking like a fag\nThat's not his bag cause the plague was afraid to parade in drag\nSo instead he played the DL, brothers get jel\nCause honey's on his dick but money won't swell\nHe'd rather call Manuel for a little duel\nHave a swordfight with tools\nHe's wounded and I can't understand\nWhy a man would want to be a weak cipher man\nI thought the plan was to be hard as a rock\nNot riding a jock, sucking on a cock\n\n\nMy man George I thought he was on base\nFind out later that he was a closet case\nWoah woah he's a sweet thing\nGeorge was down with the titty titty bang bang\nNow George swung with gays, just the way he sways\nEven fooled around with his mom's lingerie\nCome get it girl, something fierce was his line\nEven wore a dress and on his face he had swine\nHe cipher monkey cipher, you fucking faggot\nCouldn't wait for gay parade so you can drag it\nGeorge used to flip, went from hitting skins to sucking nigga's dick\nGeorge better get a grip\n\nNow Georgie used to run with the ill brothers\nKids who liked to rob mothers, and do a bunch of crazy things\nHe had the ladies, a baby, a shiny black .380\nThat he always kept tucked and filled with the slugs\nNow watch how money bugs\nWeight fell it's hard to tell but believe me George has slid\nComing out the closet was the dress that he hid\nFrom the boys when we was over there I seen it out the corner of my eye\nI said damn Georgie George signify\nThe whole crew seen it now the whole block knows\nThat George gets his kicks from wearing Wisdom's clothes\n\nNow Georgie Porgie pudding pie\nWhat made you choose the path of the gays, oh why\nAin't got no reason, to hell with alibis\nWon't play basketball cause your nails ain't dry\nCall me homophobic but I know it and you know it\nYou're filthy and funny to the utmost exponent\nNever will I do that, disrespect my mommy\nSo run and hide your salami\nUsed to, didn't you, used to be my man\nInstead of shaking, you're dragging your hand\nYes it's the Abstract the info provider\nHere's your new name - the rump rider"}}, {"title": "Get a Hold", "album": "Beats, Rhymes, and

back (just) suddenly\n\nThe deadly venom, let me start from the beginning\nWe always hitting, so yo, there'll be no extra innings\nAs I send the mic out the park like Reggie Jackson\nYou be the minor leaguer who sees no action\nThe coming attraction, what, the main feature\nAnd I'mma greet ya, like a rhyming ass creature\nLurking all up in the dark, unknown parts\nThe brother well prepared is the brother who will start\nAnd that's me Akh\nI, as long as the ladies move they bodies\nWe'll have a forum to stand\nCause that happens to be the nature of man\nSexuality, it is the format baby\nAin't no ifs, no buts, no ands, or maybes\nBut I praise the Lord of the worlds that's unseen\nRespect me for that and let me do my thing\nI said, respect me for that and let me do my thing\n\nYou know we

Abstract\nGive me, to everyone in the world\nNore, Phife Dawg and Abstract\n\nYo in Iraq, all my niggas love Abstract\nYo, from Far Rock to Flushing, concussion\nEvery time a nigga rhyme it's like we get our bus' on\nI used to ride a dollar van and really get my bus on\nYo, from South Don to El Segundo\nAll my niggas getting high yo, and still living on the run though\nGet a lot of dough so now we have a lot of fun though\nQ-U, two E's, N-S\nAll we really care about is money, cheeba and sex\nWhat what what\n\nNiggas get faded, never outdated\nGive it to the world cause for long they waited\nShorties online to cop the new CD\nSo Hip Hop I bust nut in graffiti\nWe could two-piece it or we could just cease it\nShorty on my shit cause my style wild decent\nWhat's it gonna be, the party or the precinct?\nQueens cats rock, keep it rugged and recent\nMy nigga Nore thug it out (thug it out, no doubt)\nPhife Dawg bugging out (bugging out, no doubt)\nThe Love Movement no doubt (Love Movement, no doubt)\nAli Shaheed get a shout (shout it out, no doubt)\n\nYo perate, hold on, take a time out\nHuddle up, yo, Queens niggas won't fuck it up\nKeep my Southside niggas just playing the cut\nWhile my Queensbridge people stay roughing you up\nEast Elmhurst, Corona, Ayatollah\nKeep the caller ID on the Motorola\nGotta keep the po-po on the payola\nQueens niggas shut it down, now it's all over\n\n192, the Bouley Fran Lew\nMerrick, Van Wyck, Hollis Ave, Guy Brew\nHead up Jamaica Ave cop a tape by DJ Clue\nMove to the Acres, sipping on a guinney brew\nScooping ladies up in ??? makes my day complete\nFreestyling over beats for my peoples in the street\nThis is a place where stars are born\nLinden to Laurelton, we keep it hot like porn"}}, {"title": "Glamour and Glitz", "album":

oppose, then your soul will decompose\nStrive to get money and I'm not no hoe\nFresher than the air that you're breathing through your nose\nIller than the kicks that you're puttin on your toes\nYou can ask Bo but yo that nigga don't know\nAbout the dominant factor, the accurate rapper\nHere's the next chapter, page ninety-five\nNiggas so hard it's a wonder they alive\nBut yo we still survive through the danger that lurks\nMy eyes remain wide while you ass like Urk\nAnd yo my Family Matters, so all you mad hatters\nPut your thinking caps on and motherfuckin brainstorm\n'Cause I got the plan that wins and can't lose\nYour man knows who's nice, say Tip, he'll say \"True\"\nA lot of these jokers out here is blas\u00e9\nI'll be rockin mikes until a horse says 'hey'\nSome are preoccupied with glamour and glitz\nActin all bougie and making big movies\nBut I'll be in the cut, call me Incognito\nBusy making joints that will bump for my people\nYou're listening to a man who was something from nothing\nStay in me forever head, never be frontin'\n\nOnce in a while we have fun in the mix\nInto good living but some be into glitz\nEverybody knew, all the fellas and the chicks\nWe gotta wear a shoe that fits\nC'mon word, check it out now \nUh, uh, check it out now \nWhat? Uh, check it out now \n Uh, check it out, yo\n\nPeace to the girl named Hurricane G\nPeace to my girl named Dawn Paris\nPeace to the Organized Kon-fus-ion\nPeace to all my shorties who be dying too young\nPeace to both coasts and the land in between\nPeace to your man if you're doing your thing\nPeace to my peoples who is incarcerated\nAsalaam alaikum means peace, don't debate it\nDevouring, and towering over fools\nYour mic is broke and my shit's cool\nThe black man with the understanding of\nThe three wise men and the theories of Zen\nYo, I get inside the crevice like a dentist\nDisrupt, the block, like Dennis, the Menace\nShaheed is on the needle, the shit it won't weeble\nOr wobble, your rhymes is mixed up like Boggle\nBingo! That was the damn dog's name\nBut yo I know another one with much more fame\nThe Phife Dawg, and that's my word to the cipher\nAbout to bring it to your chest and 'cause strife, check it out\nYou're doubling back to your rhyming pad\nWhat I represent is MC's gone mad\nIn a perfect world there's imperfect acts\nWe've come like a guide to redirect alla that\nSo people with a gift can just flaunt and get money\nSo much, we in the bank that the shit ain't funny\nMoney is invested in real estate and stocks\nBut not inside the glamour 'cause all of that stops\n\nYo, this the Cons to the Quence\nUp in ya like a stiff one, nah'mean?\nIt's nine-five, you got to live it or rip it\nSo if you step on the streets keep it movin, nah'mean?"}}, {"title": "Go Ahead in the Rain", "album":

claim they want some\nBut see I create sounds that make your ears go numb\nPeace to Sayres Ave., yeah you know how we go\nMy best friend Steven at the Home Depot\nLaurelton is in the house, I can't forget Southside\nWalk past MCs like that girl did to Pharcyde\nI'm labeled as the cat's meow, the MC with the know-how\nAct like you know, not now but right now\nBeast of the East, on MCs I have a feast\nI'd eat that ass like quiche, crack a smile like Shanice\nStraight outta Jamaica, seen? Jamaica, Queens\nBut you could find me out in Georgia, or anywhere in between\nNow if my partners don't look good, Malik won't look good\nIf Malik don't look good, then Quest won't look good\nIf the Quest don't look good, then Queens won't look good\nBut since the sounds are universal, New York won't look good\nPicture Phife losing a battle, come on, get off it\nPut down the microphone son, surrender, forfeit\nDid I hear something 'bout a crew? What they wanna do?\nYou better call Mr. Babyface so he can bring out the cool in you\nOr it'll be a sad love song being sung by Toni Braxton\nAnd I'll dissect you like a fraction\nOh, you wannabe top cat MCs, I'll pop you like a zit\nYou wanna be the champ, you more like Chief Some-shit\nBig up myself every time when it comes to this\nMCs be running scared as if they're watching the Exorcist\nI kick more game than a crackhead from Hempstead\nMy styles are milk, man, you'd think that I was breast-fed\nYou know the steelo when the diggy Dawg is on the scene\nI dedicate this to all the MCs outta Queens\nThat goes for Onyx, LL, Run DMC\nAkinyele, Nasty Nas and the Extra P\nYou need a chart, straight up and down man, there ain't no other\nNuff respect to all my peeps that made the album cover\nYo, Tip don't worry none you know I get the party jumping\nGet on the mic and break 'em off a little little something\nYo, Tip don't worry none you know I gets the party jumping\nGet on the mic my man and break 'em off a little something\n\n\nWe got the funk doody don shit, clearly it's the bomb shit\nSo recognize me, kids memorize me\nEveryday, I be scrounging, really I be lounging\nI play the down low, very very incognito\nAries is my sign, I know that I can rhyme\nSometimes I rhyme in riddles, plus I make the honeys wiggle\nIntellect is the major, some heads like to wager\nThe skills on the hill, overlooking dollar bills\nMan, you're crazy, thinking you can phase me\nThe Ab doesn't study mere nonsense, money\nLife seems to need me, MCs seem too cheesy\nWith their doody ass renditions of defeating competition\nI rock to the roll man, yes, I'm a soul man\nBet your bottom dollar Vinia will make you holler\nAs you stand at attention, did I forget to mention\nMCs will give me twenty if I sense that they act funny\nLyrics are abundant, right there, I sound redundant\nJust mentioning the fact that the area is fat\nI dwell in the under, so honey it's no wonder\nThat I get plenty of tail, well I even get white\nI'mma bet hitting head crack, there money, take that\nBreaking niggas off, cut their bank, then I'm off\nWhile my Nikes match my Lo hat, beat joint is mad fat\nGot the cutter of the box if a kid think he's ox\nFor tier means creator, the poetry relator\nIt's hemmed like Betsy Ross, let me tell you who's the boss\n\n\nQueens got a...\nBrooklyn got a...\nBronx got a...\nStaten Island got a...\nLong Island got the zone\nJersey got a...\nPhilly got a...\nMilwaukee got a...\nL.A. got a...\nOaktown got the zone", "image":

tele\nLived in the Bronx on the block named Fteley\nHad to be jetty cause this other ho Netty\nKept blowing me up, her jonesing was steady\nTold my man Louie that I really wasn't ready\nLouie when we did it, man, we both got sweaty\n\nThis girl from my past had ridiculous ass\nShe attended UMASS and she passed every class\nWalked down the hall with her stuck up sass\nTalked to basketball players\nShe liked how they passed\nBut when I use to hit it, the bullcat she quit it\nShe wouldn't admit it but shorty was addicted\n(Say Word) Word, nigga you heard\nLike a fiend with a queen when he catches the bird\n\nKnowing how we living I'mma talk about Mayo\nSagittarian mami, her love was a KO\nWe was on the under, had to stay on the lay low\nUsed to go so deep that she used to say A-yo\nRocked with her friend but her friend drove both way\nAsked her about it and she used to say no way\nJust let it go yo, I used to say OK\nJust another day but Phife, anyway\n\nI put it down man, what you gon' do\nWell, I put it down son, what you gon' do\nWe put it down for the area crew\nAll the shortys that's smoking y'all whoo\nLooking good if you sipping on your brew\nCome here ma, we make it hot for you\n( the truth) Come here ma, we make it hot for you\n(Alisha KJ) Come here ma, we make it hot for you\nCome on Phife\n\nMet a shorty named Kenny from East Saint Louie\nBody good and plenty, the finest in Missouri\nIf you had no money, you better hit the highway\nEven in her own right, she had to do it her way\n\nIt was an ill situation when I met Dantanya\nWorked in Saint Louis in her mother's hair parlor\nUse to hit her man for cake to come see me\nHer and her man from home, they sold heemey\nWe had it hemmed, locked, sold and shit\nWhen I dug her yo she said I was the ultimate\nBroke her up kid, driving the drill like Truck Turner\nAll other things they did not concern her\nPeople that we love yo, we love with a passion\nI'm the type of cat that brings forth the action\nYou feeling me yo, I hope you hearing me yo\nOne more thing before you start cheering me yo\n\nI put it down man, what you gon' do\nWell, I put it down son, what you gon' do\nWe put it down for the area crew\nAll the shortys that's smoking y'all whoo\nLooking good if you sipping on your brew\nCome here ma, we make it hot for you\nCome here ma, we make it hot for you\nCome here ma, we make it hot for you\nCome here ma, we make it hot for you\nCome here ma, we make it hot for you\nCome here ma, we make it hot for you\nCome here ma, we make it hot for you\nCome here ma, we make it

platter\n\nAyo, put one up for the Phifer, long time no hear from\nSuckers walkin' around talking about they could get some\nBut that vibe is non cypher, no can do\nAnd if you take I fi' joke, then ask the other two\nAnd I proceed to let you know, exactly how to flow\nI'm not Lawn Doctor so just seckle with the hoe\nOops...my mistake, I didn't know you went with her\nShould I run down the line of all the kids that done hit her?\nDon't be bitter, I hear that honey resembles a critter\nHeard she likes the two-on-one like my man John Ritter\nBut back to the subject, you can't catch wreck\nYou must get respect, to earn respect\nSuckers think they could hurt me, 'cause now I wear specs\nYou're full of jokes, but yo, your name ain't Flex\nI got the riches, the bitches, I'm large like a Huxtable\nYou think you're all that, but your girl's quite doable!\nYeah, I'm tellin' you G, to back up off me\nI\u2019m not a man called Hawk, but I ain\u2019t Mr. Softee\nRappin' is an art, coming straight from the heart\nSo forget the chart because the action can start\n\nHot sex on a platter\nHot sex on a platter\nHot sex on a platter\nHot sex on a platter\nHot sex on a platter\nHot sex on a platter\nHot sex on a platter\nHot sex on a platter\n\nHa...where ya at? To all my peoples with the funk\nI'm the undercover brother, dump your hoe in the trunk\nSave all the sad songs and the tearjerkers\nNiggas step back, it's the lyrical worker\nThe poems that I create ain't in paperback books\nThe poems that I create are for hookers and the crooks\nMy mental is excelling 'cause I dabble in the books\nI'm not the one to front on, so suboops-suboops\nYo, I gets the pickin's, I'm such a damn Dickens\nIf you step to this then the plot just thickens\nI'll run you around the track like a bunny and a dog\nTo me, your just another MC on the log\nA link in the chain, fluid on the brain\nI boast of hype lyrics, and yours are mundane\nSee, I can't maintain, especially if you come back\nI'm the lyrical master blaster, yeah, I could do that\nI could also do your girl, so leave the hoe at home\n'Cause when I get done, I'll have her strung on bones\nIt's the no-joke pressure, that elevates my mind\nMake me pick up and go when it's time to drop my rhymes\nMy title is rock, the Abstract Poetic\nI'm in the idle mode but my energy's kinetic\nSo smooth and debonair, special for the ear\nGotta keep my thing in gear\n'Cause it's evident and clear that I will rock, rock, rock...\n\nHot sex on a platter\nHot sex on a platter\nHot sex on a platter\nHot sex on a platter\nHot sex on a platter\nHot sex on a platter\nHot sex on a platter\nHot sex on a platter", "image":

can do\nAnd if you take I fi' joke, then ask the other two\nAnd I proceed to let you know, exactly how to flow\nI'm not Lawn Doctor so just seckle with the hoe\nOops...my mistake, I didn't know you went with her\nShould I run down the line of all the kids that done hit her?\nDon't be bitter, I hear that honey resembles a critter\nHeard she likes the two-on-one like my man John Ritter\nBut back to the subject, you can't catch wreck\nYou must get respect, to earn respect\nSuckers think they could hurt me, 'cause now I wear specs\nYou're full of jokes, but yo, your name ain't Flex\nI got the riches, the bitches, I'm large like a Huxtable\nYou think you're all that, but your girl's quite doable!\nYeah, I'm tellin' you G, to back up off me\nI\u2019m not a man called Hawk, but I ain\u2019t Mr. Softee\nRappin' is an art, coming straight from the heart\nSo forget the chart because the action can start\n\nHot sex on a platter\nHot sex on a platter\nHot sex on a platter\nHot sex on a platter\nHot sex on a platter\nHot sex on a platter\nHot sex on a platter\nHot sex on a platter\n\nHa...where ya at? To all my peoples with the funk\nI'm the undercover brother, dump your hoe in the trunk\nSave all the sad songs and the tearjerkers\nNiggas step back, it's the lyrical worker\nThe poems that I create ain't in paperback books\nThe poems that I create are for hookers and the crooks\nMy mental is excelling 'cause I dabble in the books\nI'm not the one to front on, so suboops-suboops\nYo, I gets the pickin's, I'm such a damn Dickens\nIf you step to this then the plot just thickens\nI'll run you around the track like a bunny and a dog\nTo me, your just another MC on the log\nA link in the chain, fluid on the brain\nI boast of hype lyrics, and yours are mundane\nSee, I can't maintain, especially if you come back\nI'm the lyrical master blaster, yeah, I could do that\nI could also do your girl, so leave the hoe at home\n'Cause when I get done, I'll have her strung on bones\nIt's the no-joke pressure, that elevates my mind\nMake me pick up and go when it's time to drop my rhymes\nMy title is rock, the Abstract Poetic\nI'm in the idle mode but my energy's kinetic\nSo smooth and debonair, special for the ear\nGotta keep my thing in gear\n'Cause it's evident and clear that I will rock, rock, rock...\n\nHot sex on a platter\nHot sex on a platter\nHot sex on a platter\nHot sex on a platter\nHot sex on a platter\nHot sex on a platter\nHot sex on a platter\nHot sex on a platter"}}, {"title": "ICU (Doin' It)", "album": "The Lost Tribes", "year": null, "lyrics": "New in hip-hop technology\nA Tribe Called Quest presents new style\n\nI C U doin\u2019 it, girl\nI C U doin\u2019\nI C U doin\u2019 it, girl\nI C U doin\u2019\nI got my Gucci, Fendi, and my thing\nAnd I\u2019m just sitting here waiting to get in something\nI C U doin\u2019 it, girl\nI C U doin\u2019\nI C U doin\u2019 it, girl\nI C U doin\u2019\nAnd then I saw somebody that looked like you\nWhen you was at the bar with the Heineken brew\nI C U doin\u2019 it, girl\nI C U doin\u2019\nWell, I don\u2019t got time \u2018cause the joint is bangin\u2019\nJust watching you, doing my thing\nI C U doin\u2019 it, ma\nI C U doin\u2019\nI C U doin\u2019 it, ma\nI C U doin\u2019\nYo, the beat, it go\u2026\n\nKinda traditional, kinda rough\nBut the beat don\u2019t deter me from your stuff\nI mean, uh, I wonder if I get it enough\nI\u2019m an addict and dramatic, and I vote for your touch\nIt\u2019s those things you do that got my head twist\nSpontaneous, director of your own flick\nBox office hit, strictly those cutting those trips\nTheresa Randle type chicks, I call her \u2018Girl 6\u2019\nCaramel complexion, Gucci Rush scent\nSexually intense, abstinence nonsense\nLights, camera, I\u2019ll direct the action\nForeplay setting off her chemical reaction\nComplete satisfaction, all around attraction\nGo ahead and tell, ma, now don\u2019t it feel relaxing?

they'll cry out \"bo!\"\nI don't like a cop, I don't sell a rock\nBut still the kanga's clock me after a show\nStanding on the stage dripping, pouring with sweat\nTo people in the crowd I give what they get\nPapers make paid, babies make laid\nI don't really worry nor do I fret\nWaiting for the gimme and boy I got some\nSweet like a peach and tart like a plum\nI thought what I think, I rock a bead link\nLegally I sip when I turn twenty-one\nA letter to the homeboy that freaked the head dome\nThe army wants me to drop my microphone\nGotta be brief, no orders from a chief\nHot butter on what, say what, the popcorn\nOn the tour bus we hit the truck stop\nA dollar for some chips, a quarter for some pop\nWe laugh and giggle some, Phife gets the honeybuns\nAli Shaheed Muhammad keeps talking that shop\nThe brothers cruise on as we quest for the check\nCalling up Famous to see if it's there yet\nNot a bourgeoise, hate the seminar\nIgnorant flip, hey miss you must jet\nFlex for the funkiest, butts start to bounce\nMeasure Hip Hop for weight, by the ounce\nBush on the tush, you're pulling while I push\nPlay me for the punk then puss, feel the pounce\n\nIt's like that y'all (keep on)\nFreak freak y'all (keep on)\n(Repeat x4)\n\nA young baby brother growing up in the world\nUsed to be a bottle now a 40 and a girl\nStanding on the corner cold chilling, talking shit\nWake up in the morning fix a plate of hominy grits\nChange my diaper, clean my pacifier\nSmoke to get higher if I would like to jump\nMuhammad drum machining, dust it off clean and\nMake a funky beat to keep the street steaming\nLook from the heart and cold living lum\nGood from the start like a newborn nun\nEat to get fatter, but that don't matter\nBorn out in Brooklyn and that's where I'm from\nMay 22nd out on Ocean Ave\nFrom around the way so I be knowing the half\nPeace to Sweet Daddy and on to Mike G\nThe harder they come is as hard as we be\n\n\nIf the papes come yo yo I won't riff\nI'll just sit down and get me a spliff\nWith mines I was born, a child of the corn\nMolecules of the land they uplift\nLevels is straight, in fact they're rectified\nAdrenaline now is crazy multiplied\nFour and four is eight, if fat shit makes the plate\nI make sure the Tribe is in\nWith the quickness you bear the witness\nFlexing and pumping with the fitness\nMoving it - uh, doing it - uh\nThose who oppose must hit the s-list\nDoing it, doing it with the whole frame\nLook what's in the mind and not in the brain\nOn this you can quote, we on a diffy note\nQuest for the future, 'stead of the fame\nOne ninety-one brothers grabbing they thingies\nForgot the name, oh, equivalent to Jimmy\nHiddle-iddle-it, you think I have to quit\nAli Shaheed Muhammad, with the singy-singy\nSlamming with a slammy you front, on the case\nRight or left nut Ali plays the ace\nDo what you do, flam for a crew\nBonita Applebum blows smoke in Sha's face\nSlang for the kang, you must if you have\nDribble hops out giggle yo proper term is laugh\nBrothers who are snakes, I label them as fakes\nInstincts to travel up the hood path, c'mon\n\n\nThank you\nAs you all know, you just can't believe everything you see and hear, can you?\nNow if you will excuse me I must be on my way"}}, {"title": "I Left My Wallet in El Segundo", "album": "People's Instinctive Travels and the Paths of Rhythm", "year": "1990-04-11",

Segundo\nI left my wallet in El Segundo\nI left my wallet in El Segundo\nI got to get it, I got, got to get it\n\nMy mother went away for a month-long trip\nHer and some friends on an ocean liner ship\nShe made a big mistake by leaving me home\nI had to roam so I picked up the phone\nDialed Ali up to see what was going down\nTold him I pick him up so we could drive around\nTook the Dodge Dart, a '74\nMy mother left a yard but I needed one more\nShaheed had me covered with a hundred greenbacks\nSo we left Brooklyn and we made big tracks\nDrove down the Belt, got on the Conduit\nCame to a toll, and paid and went through it\nHad no destination, we was on a quest\nAli laid in the back so he can get rest\nDrove down the road for two-days-and-a-half\nThe sun had just risen on a dusty path\nJust then a figure had caught my eye\nA man with a sombrero who was 4 feet high\nI pulled over to ask where we was at\nHis index finger he tipped up his hat\nEl segundo, he said, my name is Pedro\nIf you need directions, I'll tell you pronto\nNeed a civilization, some sort of reservation\nHe said a mile south there's a fast food station\nThanks, se\u00f1or, as I started the motor\nAli said \"Damn, Tip, what did you drive so far for?\"\nWell describe to me what the wallet looks like\n\nAnyway a gas station we passed\nWe got gas and went on to get grub\nIt was a nice little pub in the middle of nowhere\nAnywhere would have been better\nI ordered enchiladas and I ate em\nAli had the fruit punch\nWhen we finished we thought for ways to get back\nI had a hunch\nAli said: pay for lunch, so I did it\nPulled out the wallet and I saw this wicked beautiful lady\nShe was a waitress there\nPut the wallet down and stared and stared\nTo put me back into reality, here's Shaheed\n\"Yo Tip man, you got what you need?\"\nI checked for keys and started to step\nAnd what do you know, my wallet I forget\nIt was a brown wallet, it had props numbers\nIt had my jimmy hats, I gotta get it man\n\nLord, have mercy\nThe heat got hotter, Ali starts to curse me\nI feel bad but he makes me feel badder\nChit-chit-chatter, car starts to scatter\nBreaking on out, we was northeast bound\nJetting on down at the speed of sound\nThree days coming and three more going\nWe get back and there was no slack\n490 Madison, we're here, Sha\nHe said, \"all right, Tip, see you tomorrow\nThinking about the past week, the last week\nHands go in my pocket, I can't speak\nHopped in the car and torped' to the shack\nOf Shaheed, we gotta go back\nWhen he said \"Why?,\" I said \"We gotta go\n'Cause I left my wallet in El Segundo\"\n\nI left my wallet in El Segundo\nI left my wallet in El Segundo\nI left my wallet in El Segundo\nI got to get it, I got, got to get it\nI left my wallet in El Segundo\nI left

got to get it, I got, got to get it\nI left my wallet in El Segundo\nI left my wallet in El Segundo\nI left my wallet in El Segundo\nI got to get it, I got, got to get it\n\nMy mother went away for a month-long trip\nHer and some friends on an ocean liner ship\nShe made a big mistake by leaving me home\nI had to roam so I picked up the phone\nDialed Ali up to see what was going down\nTold him I pick him up so we could drive around\nTook the Dodge Dart, a '74\nMy mother left a yard but I needed one more\nShaheed had me covered with a hundred greenbacks\nSo we left Brooklyn and we made big tracks\nDrove down the Belt, got on the Conduit\nCame to a toll, and paid and went through it\nHad no destination, we was on a quest\nAli laid in the back so he can get rest\nDrove down the road for two-days-and-a-half\nThe sun had just risen on a dusty path\nJust then a figure had caught my eye\nA man with a sombrero who was 4 feet high\nI pulled over to ask where we was at\nHis index finger he tipped up his hat\nEl segundo, he said, my name is Pedro\nIf you need directions, I'll tell you pronto\nNeed a civilization, some sort of reservation\nHe said a mile south there's a fast food station\nThanks, se\u00f1or, as I started the motor\nAli said \"Damn, Tip, what did you drive so far for?\"\nWell describe to me what the wallet looks like\n\nAnyway a gas station we passed\nWe got gas and went on to get grub\nIt was a nice little pub in the middle of nowhere\nAnywhere would have been better\nI ordered enchiladas and I ate em\nAli had the fruit punch\nWhen we finished we thought for ways to get back\nI had a hunch\nAli said: pay for lunch, so I did it\nPulled out the wallet and I saw this wicked beautiful lady\nShe was a waitress there\nPut the wallet down and stared and stared\nTo put me back into reality, here's Shaheed\n\"Yo Tip man, you got what you need?\"\nI checked for keys and started to step\nAnd what do you know, my wallet I forget\nIt was a brown wallet, it had props numbers\nIt had my jimmy hats, I gotta get it man\n\nLord, have mercy\nThe heat got hotter, Ali starts to curse me\nI feel bad but he makes me feel badder\nChit-chit-chatter, car starts to scatter\nBreaking on out, we was northeast bound\nJetting on down at the speed of sound\nThree days coming and three more going\nWe get back and there was no slack\n490 Madison, we're here, Sha\nHe said, \"all right, Tip, see you tomorrow\nThinking about the past week, the last week\nHands go in my pocket, I can't speak\nHopped in the car and torped' to the shack\nOf Shaheed, we gotta go back\nWhen he said \"Why?,\" I said \"We gotta go\n'Cause I left my wallet in El Segundo\"\n\nI left my wallet in El Segundo\nI left my wallet in El Segundo\nI left my wallet in El Segundo\nI got to get it, I got, got to get it\nI left my wallet in El Segundo\nI left my wallet in El Segundo\nI left my wallet in El Segundo\nCome on, let's go\n\nCome on, let's go\nCome on, let's go\n(Yo Phife)"}},

June\nHeineken bottle caps and the aroma of boom\nAround the time everybody just got home from class\nShooting dice, talkin shit, hoping the cash would last\nYo, this was around the time when I didn't know no better\nJuney moved around in a tinted out Jetta\n\nThen he introduced me to that hydro smoke\nAnd I took one toke, yo, I almost choked\nSee I never smoked before so my nerves got shot\nThen he told me about the party at the spot Jamroc\nIt was guaranteed on but I said \"Son, chill\"\nThere's a joint around the way that's supposed to be real\nWord\n\nHe said we got all day, so we gonna do it right\nHit your man's joint first and Jamroc in one night\nThen I said \"Aight\", then I hopped inside the jetty\nLet me take a shower, I'm sweaty, and then I'll be ready\nTonight is the night I get my groove on steady\nAnd get my drink on with that Ford named Betty\nI went upstairs to get fly, smoke my Thai\nDrunk some liquor, to meet my high quicker\nNow, I'm type stimo, the party is the M.O\nMe and my crew, we get it started like a demo\nEleven in the evening, I'm feelin like a heathen\nThis thing is going down and I highly doubt I'm leaving\nBooty cheeks are in motion and the kids was drinking potion\nWord is bond, that Black Moon joint got me open\n(Don't front)\n\nYo, the DJ flipped the script\nThrew on the good shit that made the kid lose his grip\nBlendin Risin to the Top and got these shorties hoppin\nNumber coppin', ain't no stoppin me now\nYo, I'm bound to win until that thing kicked in\nThe Aliz\u00e9 had me stuck, I don't know where to begin(echoed)\n\nNow I'm feeling kinda jaded, wild incoherent\nMe and the fellas started acting irreverent\nButt grabbin, mad laughin, just assin\n\nThen that chick caught up, the shorty looking fed up\nThey said you jonesin' with this one, gibbin' with that one\n\nA yo, I'm just doing my thing, yo I'm just having fun\nYou don't see me in here wylin pulling out no gun\nYo, I see some of that thing girl and I want some\nSo let's step inside this corner so that we can rap on\nOver this bumpin' ass song plus some Dom Perignon\n\nI hit ya with the good lovin plus fillet mignon\n(Yeah, yeah scrammy scrams, that's that same old song\nA yo, tell me why the hell your breath smells so strong)\n\nYo, put some brakes on your yappin or you won't live long\n(Please nigga, push on)\nAlright scrams, see you later (scrams)\nCan't mess with these street sharks or these alligators\n\nI can't take it no more, yo it's damn near four\nI've been partyin and drinkin since I came out my door\n (Consequence)\nLook at these kids about to mix it, damn, where's the exit?\n(Son, jetted to the ride and got the burner out the Lexus)\nYo, he cocked his joint back like he's about to let him have it\n(Kid, I kept it movin like the Energizer rabbit)\nA yo yo, it's time to skate, ain't no time to contemplate\n(all: Whoops, looka there, there's Jake)"}}, {"title": "Jazz (We've Got)", "album": "The Low End Theory", "year":

it in your boom it in your boom it in your Jeep\nOr your Honda or your Beemer or your Legend or your Benz\nThe rave of the town to your foes and your friends\nSo push it, along, trails, we blaze\nDon't deserve the gong, don't deserve the praise\nThe tranquility will make you unball your fist\nFor we put Hip Hop on a brand new twist\nA brand new twist with a whole heap of mystic\nSo low-key that you probably missed it\nAnd yet it's so loud that it stands in the crowd\nWhen the guy takes the beat, they bowed\nSo raise up squire, adjust your attire\nWe have no time to wallow in the mire\nIf you're on a foreign path, then let me do the lead\nJoin in the essence of the cool-out breed\nThen cool out to the music cause it makes you feel serene\nWith the birds and the bees and all those groovy things\nLike getting stomach aches when you gotta go to work\nOr staring into space when you're feeling berserk\nI don't really mind if it's over your head\nCause the job of resurrectors is to wake up the dead\nSo pay attention, it's not hard to decipher\nAnd after the horns, you can check out the Phifer\n\nWe got the jazz, we got the jazz\nWe got the jazz, we got the jazz\nWe got the

must come straight way\nHow's about that, it seems like it's my turn again\nAll through the years my mic has been my best friend\nI know some brothers wonder, can Phife really kick it?\nSome even wanna dis me, but why sweat it?\nI'm all into my music cos it's how I make papes\nTry to make hits, like Kid Capri makes tapes\nMe sweat another? I do my own thing\nStrictly hardcore tracks, not a new jack swing\nI grew up as a Christian so to Jah I give thanks\nCollect my banks, listen to Shabba Ranks\nI sing, and chat, I do all of that\nIt's 1991 and I refuse to come wack\nI take off my hat to other crews that tend to rock\nBut the Low End Theory's here, it's time to wreck shop\nI got Tip and Shah, so whom shall I fear\nStop look and listen, but please don't stare\nSo jet to the store, and buy the LP\nOn Jive/RCA, cassettes and CD's\nProduced and arranged by the four-man crew\nAnd oh shit, Skeff Anselm, he gets props too\nMake sure you have a system with some fat house speakers\nSo the new shit can rock, from Bronx to Massapequa\nCause where I come from quality is job one\nAnd everybody up on Linden know we get the job done\nSo peace to that crew, and peace to this crew\nBring on the tour, we'll see you at a theatre nearest you\n\nHey yo but wait, back it up, hup, easy back it up\nPlease let the Abstract embellish on the cut\nBack and forth just like a Cameo song\nIf you dig this joint then please come dance along\nTo the music cause it's done just for the rhyme\nNow I gotta scat and get mine, underline\nThe jazz, the what? The jazz can move that ass\nCause the Tribe originates that feeling of pizazz\nIt's the universal sound, bless the brothers on the ground\nAnd the ones six below, you didn't have to go\nSome say that I'm eccentric cause I once had an orgy\nAnd sometimes for breakfast I eat grits and porgies\nIf this is a stinker, then call me a skunk, I ask\n(\"What's, wrong?\") Now check it out\n\nAll my peoples in Queens ya don't stop\nNow all my peoples in Brooklyn ya don't stop\nAnd all my peoples uptown ya don't stop\nThat includes the Bronx and Harlem ya don't stop\nNow to that girl Ramelle ya don't stop\nI said because Ladies First ya don't stop\nAnd to the JB's, ya don't stop\nAnd De La Soul, ya don't stop\nTo my Brand Nubians ya don't stop\nAnd to my Leaders of the New ya don't stop\nTo my man Large Professor ya don't stop\nPete Rock for the beat ya don't stop\nEverybody in the place ya don't stop\nYou keep it on, to the rhythm, ya don't stop\nAnd last but not least on the sure shot\nIt's the Zulu nation", "image": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/filepicker-images-rapgenius/23SMGLPXTaK18FDsttZr_R-95059-1332641012.jpeg.jpg", "artist": "A Tribe Called Quest", "raw": {"annotation_count": 68, "api_path": "/songs/976", "description": {"dom": {"tag": "root", "children": [{"tag": "p", "children": ["\u201cJazz (We\u2019ve Got)\u201d is ", {"tag": "a", "attributes": {"href": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jazz_rap", "rel": "nofollow"}, "children": ["Jazz rap"]}, " at its finest.

rugged\nTough like a nugget\nListen to The Abstract Poetic, don't snub it\nThe midnight marauder is the hype beat arranger\nDon't front on my lyrics or the tool 'cause it's danger\nHook you like a junkie, you'll flip like a monkey\nTo the openness of the rhythm, so proceed because I'm funky\nI get down, down like a fly hooker's panties\nMake you catch a spirit and motivate a fanny\nI be the fly poet, rappers, they get jelly\nUpset when I rock, 'cause yo, they rhymes is smelly\nSee, I got it going on like a Forbes tax return\nListening to these lyrics when it's hot will make it burn\nBaby burn, baby burn, up into the heavens\nThe skies up above, the one you think of\nIs the highly regarded, hell of the people\nYour mic and my mic? Come on, yo, no equal (Word!)\nSo if ya wanna do it to yourself\nThat is to mess around with the jazz, then just blame yourself\n'Cause you made your bed, so now you lay in it\nThat's your shit on the floor, then go and play in it\nI refuse to catch a 'L' in a battle\n'Cause yo, I got the jazz and I'll whup a rapper's ass\nInto little next to nuthin'\nTest me if I'm frontin'\nI'll pass with flying colors 'cause yo, I am that brotha that can rock\n\nWho got the jazz?

to Russia\nBack down to London, Sweden and Brazil\nDo a U.S. tour for three months and then I chill\nStyles be fat like Jackie Gleason, the rest be Art Carney\nPeople love the Dawg like the kids love Barney\n\"I love you, you love me\"\nThe shorty Phife Dawg is your favorite MC\nSo move back yaself dread, you know the element\nThe Tribe is good for your health like a can of Nutrament\nMC's don't have no wins, MC's don't have no (bitches)\nI flip shit crazier than a busload full of Jerry's Kids\nYour crew don't want it and your crew don't want it\nBut if you feel you can swing it, then money please bring it\nLarge Professor in the house, you know how we do\nI skate on your crew, like Mario Lemieux\nPeace to Ike Love and the rest of the crew\nI'll meet you guys in front the cleaners, bring

back, simple as that\nI ain't no almanac, so lick my dictionary\nI might just call a cab 'cause I dig canary\nYellow accents on a dark bitch\nI met her back when she kept all her carpet\nI'm well aware all that shit is fantasy\nI double dare y'all to fuck your plan B\nThat's demeanor, momma's mannerisms\nThat mean, don't mean to get vulgar, but it's some\nHoes in this bitch like a box of donuts\nIt's cold out in this bitch, standing on the corner\nCondolences to niggas that got erased\nI pour out some liquor on a cop's grave\nMmm, digital church bells\nRingin' 'cross the street, sure work well\n\n(Kids) Kids, don't you know how all this shit is fantasy?\n(Kids) Kids, don't you know how all this shit is fantasy?\n(Kids) Kids, don't you know how all this shit is fantasy?\n(Kids) For

biscuits\nAnd girls scout thin mints\nPardon my penmanship, but oh shit\nFeel like I'm hungry now again\nAnd I can't do nothing about it because my teeth are all rotted\nAnd my mom and my pop, they just grin\nAnd empathize with me 'cause they were little like Pygmies\nBut too bad they can't get back they 'member whens\nThem grown-up stories don't work\nIn the court of the kiddies', the judgement is in\nAnd while y'all doing all y'all your bids, y'all reminisce as kids\nFuck it, kids, the grown-ups won't own up\nThey stood on the corner\nLike you once upon a, time\nAnd probably felt like a loner\nAnd smelled like a stoner, and snuck to Daytona\nSo when they questioning you 'bout who or who you ain't boning\nComplaining that you always moaning\nNever saying good morning\nStorming out my house\nAnd slamming doors like you paying bills\nThey been through it too, though\nThey were kids like you, though\nBut what if they knew though\nAnd hit you with the cheat code\nTo a game you just start playing, no extra man\nLeave you reckless on the court\nWith no high percentage shot\nJust a bunch of, \"You got 'em, nigga, just give it what you got\"\nYeah, it look a little different on a yacht\nBut ain't gon' lie, I miss kayaking\nI love the young niggas, and they do too, they just be acting\nLike a bunch of retired tired thespians, a bit too salty\nShit, their blood pressure high, why?\nThey don't play no more, probably\n\n(Kids) Kids, don't you know how all this shit is fantasy?\n(Kids) Kids, don't you know how all this shit is fantasy?\n(Kids) Kids, don't you know how all

was in the back of the joint cooling out\nAnd saw this girl\nAsked if her if she like it like that, yo\nYou like it that (repeat till fade)"}}, {"title": "Lost Somebody", "album": "We got it from

wasn\u2019t supposed to be born\nBest of us are left for dead in cities that looks war-torn\nVietnam going wrong, heroin going strong\nNeighbors would whoop that bad ass\nJust for running through their lawn\nWalt met Cheryl, Cheryl met Walt\nTrinidadian love sprouting through the asphalt\nLove was consummated and the angels registrated\nTwo were to be born but only one of 'em made it\nInside a cloud of sorrow, a silver lining and joy\nIt\u2019s a bouncing baby boy, a king\u2019s name they would employ\nAnd before he even squeaks, it\u2019s decided it\u2019s Malik\nNow give him hope, give him care\nRaise him while his grandma there\nWatch out momma, if you stare\nLight brown eyes'll keep you there\nLet\u2019s progress the story just a little bit\nMalik, I would treat you like little brother that would give you fits\nSometimes overbearing though I thought it was for your benefit\nDespite all the spats and shits cinematically documented\nThe one thing I appreciate, you and I, we never pretended\nRhymes we would write it out, hard times fight it out\nGave grace face to face, made it right\nAnd now you riding out, out, out, out, damn\n\nHave you ever loved somebody?\n(Phife dawg, man)\nWay before you got to dream?\n(Bow wow, woof woof)\nNo more crying, he\u2019s in sunshine\n\nNever thought that I would be ever writing this song\nHold friends tight, never know when those people are gone\nSo, so beautiful, opined indisputable\nHeart of a largest lion trapped inside the little dude\nTook me quick to granny house, now we eat the curry food\nTalking hopes, dreams, plans, leak ice, never scared\nBrand new pair of Nike Airs, avenue of sairs\nMailbox mayors, all our rhymes was written there\nA nigga wanna battle, you know Phifey didn\u2019t care\nJarobi with the beat, into new ass we tear\nI\u2019mma flash forward well, took a trip to ATL\nCooking in the kitchen making sure my nigga eating well\nWedding in Tobago, you know exactly where I\u2019m at\nStanding on the side of black Malik Izaak\n\nHave you ever loved somebody?\nWay before you got to dream?\nNo more crying, he\u2019s in sunshine\nHe\u2019s alright now, see his wings\nHave you ever loved somebody?\nWay before you got to dream?\nNo more crying, he\u2019s in sunshine\nHe\u2019s alright now, see his wings\nHave you ever loved somebody?\nWay before you got to dream?\nNo more crying, he\u2019s in sunshine\nHe\u2019s alright now, see his wings\nHave you ever loved somebody?\nWay before you got to dream?\nNo more crying, he\u2019s in sunshine\nHe\u2019s alright now, see his

who were always on his tail\nWe ain't on sale, your rumor starts to wail\nGet caught with stolen goods and you will go to jail\nIf you go to jail, then who will pay the bail?\nDeport you back to France on a ship with a sail\nEscargot, Lucien, you eat snails\n(Hey yo Tip, what's wrong with snails?)\nFrom the Zulu nation, from a town called Paris\nCame to America to find liberty\nInstead of finding pleasure, all you found was misery\nBut listen, Lucien, you have a friend in me\nOh, luck-luck will drive your butt batty\nNext time you get some wheels, make it a Caddy\nIn terms of doing good, I know you wish you really could\nBut listen, brother man, I really think you can\nSucceed with the breed of the brothers on your back\nIt's the creme de la creme, and you can vouch for that\nIt'll take a minute, rice, so take my advice\nTrust in us, and thus you trust in your life\nLucien, Lucien, Lucien, Lucien - you should know!\n\n- What? Oh Tip, man, why you do that to me, man?\nI though he was a friend, yo\nOh man, can't believe that\nOh, why you do that to me?\nI  like this\nI can do it by myself\nYo, it's \n\nAre you ready, Lu? This one is for you\nComin' from a true-blue, fits like a shoe\n\"\u00bfC\u00f3mo est\u00e1 usted?\" or \"Comment allez-vous\"\nLucien, I'll leave it up to you\nVoulez-vous? (vous)\nRendez-vous (vous)\nCoucou (cou)\nLes poupous (pou)\nWatch that lass, gonna backlash fast\nCan you get a grip on the crackhead dip?\nSold you a paper bag, guess he saw you comin'\nVCR from a neck-bone bummin'\n$10 brother, he was hummin' and strummin'\nOnly had 20, he was livin' like ya slummin'\nGave him the money, well, I thought that was somethin'\nLookin' like a kid who was lost in crumbin'\nDon't worry about a thing, I won't get specific\nThis is a song that is long and prolific\nThink of the stuff that I said if you can\nFigure it out, compute, understand\nNo problemo, I'll help you with your demo\nIf you go to the store for me\nLucien, I'm just kiddin'\nYou should know!\n\n- Hey, yo, wassup' man? What's your name?\n- You have an accent \n- It's a french accent, you know, I'm french, I'm from Paris, don't you think it's sexy?\n- No, it's not a sexy accent\n- Oh, man ! Give me a try ! You try to kiss me enough? Hun? Oh please what! Love me french, french me love, everybody love my accent! Why nobody like it? Q-Tip  city of Paris. Why is that? Oh! I'm sexy, and I'm french, everybody love my accent, I'm the best, yes, yeah! Je t'aime! I love you! I love you oui, je t'aime! I'll teach you french, I'll make your french good!\n\nYou gotta get a grip on the missions you'll be takin'\nNot so much the mission, but you got crazy ignition\nSure, the sugar-babies wanna give you a chance\nWith the French \"savoir faire\" and the sexy glance\nBut is she really fly, or is she a guy?\nI won't ask why, 'cause I know that you try\nYou try too hard, is that the answer to the riddle?\nInstead of doin' so much, why don't you do just a little?\nBoy, what a cad, I guess we shouldn't treat him bad\nIn fact, it would be nice if we understood him like\nA case of positionin' the feet in the shoes\nSympathetic reason in the case of the blues\nLucien is blue, even though he's really brown\nI had to make the sound, his life is too profound\nOn the up-and-up, he's somethin' like a little pup\nYoung and naive, it's hard to believe\nAs long as you're strong, you can quest with the Questers\nJolly like a jumping bean or a jester\nLucien, Lucien, Lucien, Lucien\nYou should know!\n\nOh Tip, everything, you gonna be alright, man\nThank you , man\nI think I'll going home, man\nBye-bye, I'll see you tonight\nOh Tip, , I'm not here", "image": "https://images.genius.com/6527566f22d216ea6df0175321c3e473.997x1000x1.png", "artist": "A Tribe Called Quest", "raw": {"annotation_count": 34, "api_path": "/songs/3290", "description": {"dom": {"tag": "root", "children": [{"tag": "p", "children": [{"tag": "a", "attributes": {"href": "https://genius.com/artists/Lucien-papalu-mbaidem"}, "data": {"api_path": "/artists/663435"}, "children": ["Lucien Revolucien"]}, " was a French hip hop artist in the 1990s who was also featured on  Afrika Bambaataa\u2019s anti-apartheid anthem.

who were always on his tail\nWe ain't on sale, your rumor starts to wail\nGet caught with stolen goods and you will go to jail\nIf you go to jail, then who will pay the bail?\nDeport you back to France on a ship with a sail\nEscargot, Lucien, you eat snails\n(Hey yo Tip, what's wrong with snails?)\nFrom the Zulu nation, from a town called Paris\nCame to America to find liberty\nInstead of finding pleasure, all you found was misery\nBut listen, Lucien, you have a friend in me\nOh, luck-luck will drive your butt batty\nNext time you get some wheels, make it a Caddy\nIn terms of doing good, I know you wish you really could\nBut listen, brother man, I really think you can\nSucceed with the breed of the brothers on your back\nIt's the creme de la creme, and you can vouch for that\nIt'll take a minute, rice, so take my advice\nTrust in us, and thus you trust in your life\nLucien, Lucien, Lucien, Lucien - you should know!\n\n- What? Oh Tip, man, why you do that to me, man?\nI though he was a friend, yo\nOh man, can't believe that\nOh, why you do that to me?\nI  like this\nI can do it by myself\nYo, it's \n\nAre you ready, Lu? This one is for you\nComin' from a true-blue, fits like a shoe\n\"\u00bfC\u00f3mo est\u00e1 usted?\" or \"Comment allez-vous\"\nLucien, I'll leave it up to you\nVoulez-vous? (vous)\nRendez-vous (vous)\nCoucou (cou)\nLes poupous (pou)\nWatch that lass, gonna backlash fast\nCan you get a grip on the crackhead dip?\nSold you a paper bag, guess he saw you comin'\nVCR from a neck-bone bummin'\n$10 brother, he was hummin' and strummin'\nOnly had 20, he was livin' like ya slummin'\nGave him the money, well, I thought that was somethin'\nLookin' like a kid who was lost in crumbin'\nDon't worry about a thing, I won't get specific\nThis is a song that is long and prolific\nThink of the stuff that I said if you can\nFigure it out, compute, understand\nNo problemo, I'll help you with your demo\nIf you go to the store for me\nLucien, I'm just kiddin'\nYou should know!\n\n- Hey, yo, wassup' man? What's your name?\n- You have an accent \n- It's a french accent, you know, I'm french, I'm from Paris, don't you think it's sexy?\n- No, it's not a sexy accent\n- Oh, man ! Give me a try ! You try to kiss me enough? Hun? Oh please what! Love me french, french me love, everybody love my accent! Why nobody like it? Q-Tip  city of Paris. Why is that? Oh! I'm sexy, and I'm french, everybody love my accent, I'm the best, yes, yeah! Je t'aime! I love you! I love you oui, je t'aime! I'll teach you french, I'll make your french good!\n\nYou gotta get a grip on the missions you'll be takin'\nNot so much the mission, but you got crazy ignition\nSure, the sugar-babies wanna give you a chance\nWith the French \"savoir faire\" and the sexy glance\nBut is she really fly, or is she a guy?\nI won't ask why, 'cause I know that you try\nYou try too hard, is that the answer to the riddle?\nInstead of doin' so much, why don't you do just a little?\nBoy, what a cad, I guess we shouldn't treat him bad\nIn fact, it would be nice if we understood him like\nA case of positionin' the feet in the shoes\nSympathetic reason in the case of the blues\nLucien is blue, even though he's really brown\nI had to make the sound, his life is too profound\nOn the up-and-up, he's somethin' like a little pup\nYoung and naive, it's hard to believe\nAs long as you're strong, you can quest with the Questers\nJolly like a jumping bean or a jester\nLucien, Lucien, Lucien, Lucien\nYou should know!\n\nOh Tip, everything, you gonna be alright, man\nThank you , man\nI think I'll going home, man\nBye-bye, I'll see you tonight\nOh Tip, , I'm not here"}}, {"title": "Lyrics to Go", "album": "Midnight Marauders", "year": "1993-11-09", "lyrics": "Lyrics to go (lyrics to go) uhh\nLyrics to go (lyrics to go) ahh yeah, c'mon\nLyrics to go (lyrics to go)\nLyrics to go (lyrics to go) yeah yeah\nLyrics to go (lyrics to go)\n\nGoin on and on to the rhythmic variation\nWakin in the morning I still represent the nation\nWhen I speak of nation please don't make the deviation\nRebels of the party who create the drum sensation\nMind is a pit of different information\nMicrophone is on so of course communication\nBogle at the party then you got the bogle-ation\nDecaptatin' foes, yo, as if my name was Jason (c'mon)\nMakin all the fellas at the party lose composure\nHook up the beat with the mic and it's over (original, uh!)\nA Tribe Called Quest we on the run for whatever\nTrials and tribulations that we have to endeavor\nBrothers know my steelo it's a letter to the better\nIf you see a shorty that you like, then you sweat her\nSilly with the microphone, in other words I'm loco\nSix foot zero with my height, complexion cocoa\nRepresentin on the mic it seems to be my daily\nI can do a split and turn around like Alvin Ailey\nBut when it comes to days like this I got lyrics to go\n\n(I got lyrics to go) It's like that y'all, c'mon y'all\nLyrics to go It's like that y'all, c'mon y'all\n(Lyrics to go) It's like that\n\nI know it's been two years but see the Tribe was never fallin\nWould have tried for singin but that stuff was not my callin\nThe mic is in effect so you know I'm never stallin\nWalkin through the door and all them suckers started haulin\nTalk a lot of trash but no one can seem to beat it\nPull out your microphone and watch the Phifer make you eat it\nThe MC's they get jealy when the girly's on my belly\nKick a slow dance like my brother R.

(lyrics to go) yeah yeah\nLyrics to go (lyrics to go)\n\nGoin on and on to the rhythmic variation\nWakin in the morning I still represent the nation\nWhen I speak of nation please don't make the deviation\nRebels of the party who create the drum sensation\nMind is a pit of different information\nMicrophone is on so of course communication\nBogle at the party then you got the bogle-ation\nDecaptatin' foes, yo, as if my name was Jason (c'mon)\nMakin all the fellas at the party lose composure\nHook up the beat with the mic and it's over (original, uh!)\nA Tribe Called Quest we on the run for whatever\nTrials and tribulations that we have to endeavor\nBrothers know my steelo it's a letter to the better\nIf you see a shorty that you like, then you sweat her\nSilly with the microphone, in other words I'm loco\nSix foot zero with my height, complexion cocoa\nRepresentin on the mic it seems to be my daily\nI can do a split and turn around like Alvin Ailey\nBut when it comes to days like this I got lyrics to go\n\n(I got lyrics to go) It's like that y'all, c'mon y'all\nLyrics to go It's like that y'all, c'mon y'all\n(Lyrics to go) It's like that\n\nI know it's been two years but see the Tribe was never fallin\nWould have tried for singin but that stuff was not my callin\nThe mic is in effect so you know I'm never stallin\nWalkin through the door and all them suckers started haulin\nTalk a lot of trash but no one can seem to beat it\nPull out your microphone and watch the Phifer make you eat it\nThe MC's they get jealy when the girly's on my belly\nKick a slow dance like my brother R. Kelly (bust a rhyme)\nToday's a hip-hop draft will I be top-seeded? (uhh)\nWorked too frickin hard while all the rest were gettin weeded\nSteady kickin styles so I can reach that other level (uh)\nDon't worry about gettin gassed I push the pedal to the metal\nAlways wanted this cause it surely beats a scramble (right)\nI'm Jordan with the mic, huh, wanna gamble? (mmm)\nThis I dedicate to all the honeys that be bogle-in\nCause at the end of the night y'know Malik will have his Trojans\nBut when it comes to nights like this I got lyrics to go\nCheck it out y'all\n(Lyrics to go) It's like that y'all\nLyrics to go Check it out y'all\n(Lyrics to go) It's like that y'all\nLyrics to go Check it out y'all\n(Lyrics to go) It's like that y'all\nLyrics to go Check it out y'all\n(Lyrics to go) It's like that y'all\nIt's like that y'all\nCheck it out y'all\nIt's like that y'all\nCheck it out y'all\nIt's like that y'all\nCheck it out here we go!\n\nPlease proceed with caution cause the lyricist is fatal\nI can kick your little monkey ass like Kato (yes dread, uhh)\nFormulate your rhymes like a child forms Play-Doh (right)\nCalm and serene like the study was Tao\nPoetry machine with correct mechanisms\nImmune to disease I defeat organisms\nThat are waitin in my path, I overstep the critters\nGive your ass the willies and your moms'll get the jitters\nQuitters turn to losers, losers are forgotten\nTangling my cord with hopes that I\u2019ll stop rockin\nNever will that happen only if it is permitted (uhh)\nWait... I think somebody shitted (c'mon)\nI guess that will be me cause I'm the only one MCin\nI go for what I know doin a show for human beings\nAlways try to lead yo never will I follow\nBlowin up the spot like Fred did to Rollo\nAnd when it comes to days like this, I got lyrics to go\nCheck it out y'all\n(Lyrics to go) It's like that y'all\nI got lyrics to go Everybody\n(I got lyrics to go) Ah c'mon now\nI got lyrics to go Ah check it out y'all\n(I got lyrics to go) It's like that now\nI got lyrics to go Everybody\n(I got lyrics to go) Ah c'mon now\nI got lyrics to go Check it out y'all\n(I got lyrics to go) It's like that now\nI got lyrics to go C'mon y'all\n(I got lyrics to go) Everybody\nI got lyrics to go It's like that y'all\n(I got lyrics to go) Check it out now\nI got lyrics to go Ah c'mon y'all\n(I got lyrics to go) Everybody\nI got lyrics to go It's like that y'all\n(I got lyrics to go) Check it out now\nI got lyrics to go It's like that y'all\n(I got lyrics to go) Every-bo-ty\nI got lyrics to go It's like that y'all\n(I got lyrics to go) Ah check it out now\nIt's like that y'all\nCheck it now\nIt's like that y'all\nCheck it now\nIt goes... uhh"}}, {"title": "Mardi Gras at Midnight", "album": "The Lost Tribes", "year": null, "lyrics": "African-American with the power, just tapped in to the cultural gin\nThat be swallowin our minds, whole, but yo bust it\nEmpty ass rappers get me fueled and disgusted\nCan't even kick a rhyme about yourself properly\nListen man I'll show you why you ain't toppin me\nEpitomy of levelheadedness\nWhose concern is how ill I come off and how that ill that I dress\nI don't, hit you with a whole bunch of bullshit\nOn the microphone I keep my prose fluid\nSpeakin to them people in a Tongue that's Native\nNot with an ego that's anti-creative\nConscious to the fact that I'm a talented lad\nMake your move at a jam and feel better when sad\nHey, \"Assalamu Alaikum\" to them firm true believers\nHope yall pretty good as the message reciever\nCause yo we got to take things in-to our own hands\nAnd be aware of these dangerous, plentiful lands\nThat we exist within and combat and shake on\nBut do it over Tribe because Tribe is the bomb\nWe get through, especially if you got my back\nThe Abstract use machete cuttin down on slab\nAnd we do it like this, rarely do we miss\nCatch you in the chest with an eagle claw fist\nAnd back you, get it two by four and she'll lack you\nTip you only find a nigga now that out raps you\nOr gets at you, and insists that you do it\nCause you make it smooth and you make it like fluid\n\u200b\u200b\nSometimes I just be wonderin\nHow these cats be com-in IN\n..........\nI think we need to rectify this Rah\n(And show these muthafuckas how we Mardi Gras)\n\nThe name's Digga and I'm on, a mission to be larger\nThan them crackers that be running Time Warner \nI take it further, even runnin' shit in Persia\nWith acquisitions and merges\n\"You takin' me?\" I might have you stressin\n\"Your rap styles clear,\" but I'm the only danger pressin\nRah lyrics with \"UMMAH\" productions\nBe phatter than a chick that had liposuction\nThey wasn't ready, for that which came\nT'was a slim little hunny after the fat bitch sang\nI break it down like quadratic equations\nYou luke warm, my shit hotter than Cajuns\nStop, you ain't even worth my while\nMama boy tryin to play it like he motherless child\nThe whole rap industry's in upheaval\nThey play enough times then I just might believe you\nHeads was still rhymin Glock with clock\nI was puttin shit together phatter than 10 Shirley Murdock's\nAin't nuthin but a buncha, thorns in my side like you was acupuncture\nBust it, playin post with me?

minds, whole, but yo bust it\nEmpty ass rappers get me fueled and disgusted\nCan't even kick a rhyme about yourself properly\nListen man I'll show you why you ain't toppin me\nEpitomy of levelheadedness\nWhose concern is how ill I come off and how that ill that I dress\nI don't, hit you with a whole bunch of bullshit\nOn the microphone I keep my prose fluid\nSpeakin to them people in a Tongue that's Native\nNot with an ego that's anti-creative\nConscious to the fact that I'm a talented lad\nMake your move at a jam and feel better when sad\nHey, \"Assalamu Alaikum\" to them firm true believers\nHope yall pretty good as the message reciever\nCause yo we got to take things in-to our own hands\nAnd be aware of these dangerous, plentiful lands\nThat we exist within and combat and shake on\nBut do it over Tribe because Tribe is the bomb\nWe get through, especially if you got my back\nThe Abstract use machete cuttin down on slab\nAnd we do it like this, rarely do we miss\nCatch you in the chest with an eagle claw fist\nAnd back you, get it two by four and she'll lack you\nTip you only find a nigga now that out raps you\nOr gets at you, and insists that you do it\nCause you make it smooth and you make it like fluid\n\u200b\u200b\nSometimes I just be wonderin\nHow these cats be com-in IN\n..........\nI think we need to rectify this Rah\n(And show these muthafuckas how we Mardi Gras)\n\nThe name's Digga and I'm on, a mission to be larger\nThan them crackers that be running Time Warner \nI take it further, even runnin' shit in Persia\nWith acquisitions and merges\n\"You takin' me?\" I might have you stressin\n\"Your rap styles clear,\" but I'm the only danger pressin\nRah lyrics with \"UMMAH\" productions\nBe phatter than a chick that had liposuction\nThey wasn't ready, for that which came\nT'was a slim little hunny after the fat bitch sang\nI break it down like quadratic equations\nYou luke warm, my shit hotter than Cajuns\nStop, you ain't even worth my while\nMama boy tryin to play it like he motherless child\nThe whole rap industry's in upheaval\nThey play enough times then I just might believe you\nHeads was still rhymin Glock with clock\nI was puttin shit together phatter than 10 Shirley Murdock's\nAin't nuthin but a buncha, thorns in my side like you was acupuncture\nBust it, playin post with me? that's unruly\nNo matter how bougie you'll still be a moolie\nIt's Rah Digga from the O-U-T's\nHaving bullshit rappers going \"Woe is me\"\n\nWe demonstrate MCing and music\nLaced with the raw P-funk you must choose it\nWe Buck Rogers, aiyyo we sun you like Twiggie\nGirls be like (he's jiggy), and they friends be like (who is he?)\nMastering the mic like Jordan with the pill\nShowing a nigga love cause a nigga got skills\nA little sumthin sumthin, corny cats must flee\nRah Digga forms the lines with the Ab' MC\n\nAhhhhh....\nPeace Tip, the love flows abundant\nTo Pacewon, the underdopeless and youngin\nRappers be off on a tangent\nI could flow longer than the Van Wyck\nBackwards Stan Smith\nWhen I go bring the noise\nI sweep rappers by the \"Bunch\" like they Brady's boys\nSo change your sound 'fore I claim that crown\nThat's for all ya'll home girls on dangerous grounds\n\nSometimes I just be wonderin\nHow these cats be com-in IN\n..........\nI think we need to rectify this right?\n(And show these muthafuckas how we Mardi Gras)\n(Mmm, hmm)\n(Outsiders in the hosue)\n(UMMAH's in the house)"}}, {"title": "Melatonin", "album": "We got it from Here...

like they Swedish Fish (they don't know)\nTo give her everything's my dying wish (they don't know)\nRole play, she plays the mannequin (they don't know)\nRaising my hand, teacher says \"Not again\" (they don't know)\nThe sun is up, but I feel down again (they don't know)\nOn just one hand, I can count all my friends (they don't know)\n\nThe understudy for the star, the show must go on\nI'm a beast on a leash, I'm towed from the lawn\nAnother notch in my belt, the food's getting scarce\nAnother notch in my belt, she shakes up the stairs\nDrink liquid confidence, tequila's our defense\nGet rid of this tense and makes life make sense\nAs I come off the fence and break through defense\nAnxiety is on the ropes and it's gettin' intense\n\nPopulation gettin' tired now (they don't know)\nEverybody wants inspired now (they don't know)\nRacist emails fire out (they don't know)\nWe did it in the dark, it's coming out (they don't know)\nThe world is crazy and I cannot sleep but (they don't know)\nMelatonin good enough to eat but (they don't know)\nI read the paper so that I can see what (they don't know)\nI'd rather stay indoors and make a beat but (they don't know)\n\nMy mother said a lot of wise words to me\nHer Bible was like her toolie, peasy-headed and unruly\nI made her think she got to me\nFollowing the trail of reefer\nAnd niggas talking through speakers\nFattest laces through my sneakers\nThe rappers ere ghetto preachers\nThought I had it so I tried it, for so long I would just hide it\nThen I made the crowds say \"Hoo!\"\nAnd saw them all get excited\nI was hooked, I couldn't shake it\nThe more I got, I would take it\nCouldn't sleep andcouldn't eat\nBut this life, I would not forsake it\n\nI said I really dream in color now (they don't know)\nAnd every brother ain't a brother now (they don't know)\nPop melatonin like they Swedish Fish (they don't know)\nTo give her everything my dying wish (they don't know)\n\nSo many thoughts in my mind making it very hard to unwind\nI guess I should take one, just one\nSo many thoughts in my mind making it very hard to unwind\nI guess I should take one, just one\nSo many thoughts in my mind making it very hard to unwind\nI guess I should take one, just one\nSo many thoughts in my mind making it very hard to unwind\nI guess I should take one, just one\n\nThis one's for good girls that all gone bad (just one)\nThis one I'm taking when I feel sad (just one, yeah)\nThis one I'm taking to make me strong (just one)\nThis one I'm taking so that I'll live long (just one, yeah)\nThis one I'm taking to make me smile (just one)\nThis one I'm taking to make life worthwhile (just one)\nThis one and that one and those and these (just one)\nI just want to sleep, I want to be at ease (just one)"}}, {"title": "Midnight", "album": "Midnight Marauders", "year": "1993-11-09", "lyrics": "The night is on my mind\nThe sun'll still shine\nBut the night is on my mind\nSo parlay while I drop this rhyme\n\nSee, Jake be gettin illy when the sun get dark\nHe be coming out for heads but shit don't let me start\nThere's activities a-plenty in the nighttime\nFor the ghetto child it seem to be the right time\nSee, kids be getting stuck with jewels and fly gimmicks\nShorty see the action and then start to mimic\nRunning to the corner, the dice game is blazing\nLooking at the loot, it seems so amazing\nPuts the short down, to be exact one pound\nHe shakes the stones in his hand, then he lets it down\nScared money don't make none\nHe threw a trip on the ace now he's out son\nHits the local bodega to wolf down a hero\nSon is on a midnight run like De Niro\nSpots a shorty rock standing on his block\nThe fiends be hounding him to pump, so he adds to his knot\nConversation that he kicked to the shorty was a sly one\nIncreased intensity, cause damn she was a fly one\nTook her to the crib there she ran her jibs\nAbout mind upliftment and being positive\nHe yawned and he sighed til 1:05\nThen he finally realized that honey wasn't live\nAt least he didn't plan on building for the evening\nThrew the Fila on the dome and said 'Come on yo, we leaving'\nCame out on the scene as he told her to beep him\nSaw his man Stan with the blunt in his hand\n(Ah sh...) You know the transaction\nBrothers gettin lost in the weed satisfaction\nComing down the block man loud as (fuck)\nYou would swear Redman was inside the truck\nAs the night seemed darker, cops is on a hunt\nThey interrupt your cipher, and crush your blunt\nSee you left your work at home so they pat you down for nothing\nWhy in the hell does 10-4 keep fronting\nYou push to the park even though it's still dark\nThe kid is nice on the hoop, he said 'I'll spot you troop'\n\nThe night is on my mind\nThe sun\u2019ll still shine\nBut now the night is on the mind\nThe night is on the mind\nThe night is on yo mind\nAyo, the sun\u2019ll still shine\nBut now the night is on the mind\n\nAs for me I'm a nocturnal animal, God concentrates\nOn a young black man who makes the niggas speakers shake\nThe nighttime is busy, it's word to Aunt Kizzy\nIt's the time we get down, yo son, you know the sound\nThe flavas on the top with the rugged beat to back it\nThe night makes the aura and the Jake can't hack it\nThe way the moon dangles in the midnight sky\nAnd the stars dance around, a-yo I think it's fly\nIntensity, most rappers don't see it\nSpirit wise, musically, you gotta be it\nSerenity and silence of the sounds and emotions\nIn the concrete jungle when the sun don't bungle\nI think it's hard to find the words on how I feel\nI paid about a deuce twenty for the Ampex steel\nBut let me slow down, I think I ran my jibs enough\nPeace out to the Nation, stay rugged and rough\n\nThe night is on my mind\nThe sun\u2019ll still shine\nThe night is on my mind\nThe night is on my mind\nThe night is on my mind\nYeah, the sun\u2019ll still shine\nBut now the night is on my mind\nUh-huh, the night is on my mind\nThe night is on yo mind\nYou know the sun\u2019ll still shine\nBut now the night is on the mind\nYeah, the night is on the mind\nThe night is on the mind\nAyo, the sun\u2019ll still shine\nBut now the night is on the mind\nYeah, the night is on the mind\nThe night is on the mind\nAyo, the sun\u2019ll still shine\n\nDid you know that the rate of AIDS in the Black and Hispanic community is rising at an alarming rate?\nEducation is proper means for slowing it down",

is on my mind\nThe sun'll still shine\nBut the night is on my mind\nSo parlay while I drop this rhyme\n\nSee, Jake be gettin illy when the sun get dark\nHe be coming out for heads but shit don't let me start\nThere's activities a-plenty in the nighttime\nFor the ghetto child it seem to be the right time\nSee, kids be getting stuck with jewels and fly gimmicks\nShorty see the action and then start to mimic\nRunning to the corner, the dice game is blazing\nLooking at the loot, it seems so amazing\nPuts the short down, to be exact one pound\nHe shakes the stones in his hand, then he lets it down\nScared money don't make none\nHe threw a trip on the ace now he's out son\nHits the local bodega to wolf down a hero\nSon is on a midnight run like De Niro\nSpots a shorty rock standing on his block\nThe fiends be hounding him to pump, so he adds to his knot\nConversation that he kicked to the shorty was a sly one\nIncreased intensity, cause damn she was a fly one\nTook her to the crib there she ran her jibs\nAbout mind upliftment and being positive\nHe yawned and he sighed til 1:05\nThen he finally realized that honey wasn't live\nAt least he didn't plan on building for the evening\nThrew the Fila on the dome and said 'Come on yo, we leaving'\nCame out on the scene as he told her to beep him\nSaw his man Stan with the blunt in his hand\n(Ah sh...) You know the transaction\nBrothers gettin lost in the weed satisfaction\nComing down the block man loud as (fuck)\nYou would swear Redman was inside the truck\nAs the night seemed darker, cops is on a hunt\nThey interrupt your cipher, and crush your blunt\nSee you left your work at home so they pat you down for nothing\nWhy in the hell does 10-4 keep fronting\nYou push to the park even though it's still dark\nThe kid is nice on the hoop, he said 'I'll spot you troop'\n\nThe night is on my mind\nThe sun\u2019ll still shine\nBut now the night is on the mind\nThe night is on the mind\nThe night is on yo mind\nAyo, the sun\u2019ll still shine\nBut now the night is on the mind\n\nAs for me I'm a nocturnal animal, God concentrates\nOn a young black man who makes the niggas speakers shake\nThe nighttime is busy, it's word to Aunt Kizzy\nIt's the time we get down, yo son, you know the sound\nThe flavas on the top with the rugged beat to back it\nThe night makes the aura and the Jake can't hack it\nThe way the moon dangles in the midnight sky\nAnd the stars dance around, a-yo I think it's fly\nIntensity, most rappers don't see it\nSpirit wise, musically, you gotta be it\nSerenity and silence of the sounds and emotions\nIn the concrete jungle when the sun don't bungle\nI think it's hard to find the words on how I feel\nI paid about a deuce twenty for the Ampex steel\nBut let me slow down, I think I ran my jibs enough\nPeace out to the Nation, stay rugged and rough\n\nThe night is on my mind\nThe sun\u2019ll still shine\nThe night is on my mind\nThe night is on my mind\nThe night is on my mind\nYeah, the sun\u2019ll still shine\nBut now the night is on my mind\nUh-huh, the night is on my mind\nThe night is on yo mind\nYou know the sun\u2019ll still shine\nBut now the night is on the mind\nYeah, the night is on the mind\nThe night is on the mind\nAyo, the sun\u2019ll still shine\nBut now the night is on the mind\nYeah, the night is on the mind\nThe night is on the mind\nAyo, the sun\u2019ll still shine\n\nDid you know that the rate of AIDS in the Black and Hispanic community is rising at an alarming rate?\nEducation is proper means for slowing it down"}}, {"title": "Midnight Marauders [Artwork]", "album": "Midnight Marauders", "year": "1993-11-20", "lyrics": "", "image": "https://images.genius.com/834f36c594ae7b665086945b4f31282a.300x298x1.jpg", "artist": "A Tribe Called Quest", "raw": {"annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/734809", "description": {"dom": {"tag": "root", "children": [{"tag": "p", "children": ["The hip-hop personalities on the cover are:"]}, "", {"tag": "ul", "children": ["", {"tag": "li", "children": ["Afrika Bambaataa"]}, "", {"tag": "li", "children": ["AMG"]}, "", {"tag": "li", "children": ["Ant Banks"]}, "", {"tag": "li", "children": ["Awesome Two"]}, "", {"tag": "li", "children": ["Beastie Boys (Mike D, Adrock, MCA)"]}, "", {"tag": "li", "children": ["Black Moon"]}, "", {"tag": "li", "children": ["Busta Rhymes"]}, "", {"tag": "li", "children": ["Casual"]}, "", {"tag": "li", "children": ["Chi Ali"]}, "", {"tag": "li", "children": ["Chuck D"]}, "", {"tag": "li", "children": ["The Cold Crush Brothers (Almighty KG, Charlie Chase, Easy AD, Grandmaster Caz, DJ Tony Tone)"]}, "", {"tag": "li", "children": ["Daddy-O (of Stetsasonic)"]}, "", {"tag": "li", "children": ["Dallas Austin"]}, "", {"tag": "li", "children": ["Del Tha Funkee Homosapien"]}, "", {"tag": "li", "children": ["Diamond D"]}, "", {"tag": "li", "children": ["Doug E.

I got this in my spirit\nI got verses like Mahalia singin church hymns\nSo strap up because you skatin on ice that's wild thin\nA weak foundation doesn't make a good home\nThat's why mine is built on chrome microphones\nWe bout to do it theoretically, insteadibly, to the medley\nCome on\nIt's the complete Kamaal, unique, Fareed, breed\nThat'll keep you broke down like a Ross 5 speed\nSo move buddy, a yo we got to get this money\nIn this land of dead and crummy, ain't a damn thing funny\nA yo, shout out to Mobb Deep, the Extra P\nBusta Rhymes, De La, the J Beez, and don't sleep\nWe got reality for the cabbage\nStaying sincere to this, so I know we gonna manage\nGive me, liberty in mass amounts and Swiss bank accounts\nWith the sustainer, it'll be real\nSo me and my brothas, we can sit down and build\nLike Rampage with that Last Boy Scout appeal\nWe got that silk, satin, Manhattan intelligence feel\nThat keeps everything on even keels\nSo all you slow brothas talkin yang, ya poo tang\nNow, we gonna show you how the real crew bang\n\nA yo, I bring it to you live kid, Queens niggas love static\nYour rap's had it, braggin more numbers than mathematics\nI get brains on Craftmatics and leave your wet dreams shattered\nThat's the same guy be skeetin' in your mugshot\nI stays hot like summertime on LBQ and boo boos\nThe love shack is 1-9-2, my joint's smooth\nTo watch y'all niggas fall like Lin Que\nI keeps it brand new like school shoppin', it's on and poppin'\nThe club peeps this nigga's steez like radars\nYou get laid off while I'll be gaming ghetto girl like 8-Off\nThe verdict's in, I be the Luke of Linden\nGive up your goods cuz it's the start of your endin'\n\n(Where ya at?) We seein life for what it is\n(Where ya at?) We get this money for these kids\n(Where ya at?) We bout to build the foundation\n(Where ya at?)\n\nNow, all that Glock totin' trash you talk will not prevail\nIt's stale, you'll either be dead or in jail\nI keeps it realer than the logo on milk\nDenouncing tough guy wannabes that look smoother than silk\nThat's the sound of the man getting yanked off the stage\nTrying to front like he mad paid\nSucking so bad, we threw his mama off the train (insane)\nMCs are just givin it all away (OK)\nWho said him know about the Quest-like sound?\nMess around and get your ass knocked down (clown)\nI dedicate this to the posers that play hard\nYou wanna hear some rhymes, well then bring your bodyguard\nSo he can peep the worldwide Willie that we display\nLeaving all MCs in complete disarray\nI beez a veteran MC, crushing crews for years\nYou frontin' hard, when you softer than the Berenstain Bears\nYeah, chumps be like \"Phife, that ain't fair\"\n'Fuck outta here, do I look like I care?\nCome off my stage before I grab ya neck and handle ya\nWet ya like punani, then dry you like Canada\nShaheed Muhammad's on the Gemini mixer\nPeace to Derrick Coleman, Mad Max and the Sixers\nI'm cappin hard cuz I got this rap shit sold\nFrom Linden Boulevard down to Cascade Road\nYou know my steez, I treat hip hop like a sport\nHoldin down fort up on Martinique Court like...\n\n(Where ya at?)

microphones\nWe bout to do it theoretically, insteadibly, to the medley\nCome on\nIt's the complete Kamaal, unique, Fareed, breed\nThat'll keep you broke down like a Ross 5 speed\nSo move buddy, a yo we got to get this money\nIn this land of dead and crummy, ain't a damn thing funny\nA yo, shout out to Mobb Deep, the Extra P\nBusta Rhymes, De La, the J Beez, and don't sleep\nWe got reality for the cabbage\nStaying sincere to this, so I know we gonna manage\nGive me, liberty in mass amounts and Swiss bank accounts\nWith the sustainer, it'll be real\nSo me and my brothas, we can sit down and build\nLike Rampage with that Last Boy Scout appeal\nWe got that silk, satin, Manhattan intelligence feel\nThat keeps everything on even keels\nSo all you slow brothas talkin yang, ya poo tang\nNow, we gonna show you how the real crew bang\n\nA yo, I bring it to you live kid, Queens niggas love static\nYour rap's had it, braggin more numbers than mathematics\nI get brains on Craftmatics and leave your wet dreams shattered\nThat's the same guy be skeetin' in your mugshot\nI stays hot like summertime on LBQ and boo boos\nThe love shack is 1-9-2, my joint's smooth\nTo watch y'all niggas fall like Lin Que\nI keeps it brand new like school shoppin', it's on and poppin'\nThe club peeps this nigga's steez like radars\nYou get laid off while I'll be gaming ghetto girl like 8-Off\nThe verdict's in, I be the Luke of Linden\nGive up your goods cuz it's the start of your endin'\n\n(Where ya at?) We seein life for what it is\n(Where ya at?) We get this money for these kids\n(Where ya at?) We bout to build the foundation\n(Where ya at?)\n\nNow, all that Glock totin' trash you talk will not prevail\nIt's stale, you'll either be dead or in jail\nI keeps it realer than the logo on milk\nDenouncing tough guy wannabes that look smoother than silk\nThat's the sound of the man getting yanked off the stage\nTrying to front like he mad paid\nSucking so bad, we threw his mama off the train (insane)\nMCs are just givin it all away (OK)\nWho said him know about the Quest-like sound?\nMess around and get your ass knocked down (clown)\nI dedicate this to the posers that play hard\nYou wanna hear some rhymes, well then bring your bodyguard\nSo he can peep the worldwide Willie that we display\nLeaving all MCs in complete disarray\nI beez a veteran MC, crushing crews for years\nYou frontin' hard, when you softer than the Berenstain Bears\nYeah, chumps be like \"Phife, that ain't fair\"\n'Fuck outta here, do I look like I care?\nCome off my stage before I grab ya neck and handle ya\nWet ya like punani, then dry you like Canada\nShaheed Muhammad's on the Gemini mixer\nPeace to Derrick Coleman, Mad Max and the Sixers\nI'm cappin hard cuz I got this rap shit sold\nFrom Linden Boulevard down to Cascade Road\nYou know my steez, I treat hip hop like a sport\nHoldin down fort up on Martinique Court like...\n\n(Where ya at?)

get in the car like a sniper's on the roof now\nBut don't confuse how you see me have to move now\nI got bars like a cypher's in the booth now\nOoh, child, things are gonna get easier\n'Long as they get my page right on Wikipedia\n'Long as they say my name right in the media\nIf you don't, that's a sin like Cincinnati\n'Cause ever since I had the polo suit at the Grammys\nI been spittin' at the camera like Trick Daddy\nSo swaggy, he could've broke up with IG\nI ain't surprised that they broke up on IG\nI got the game on IV, might as well have a live feed\nKeep a fresh cut from IB\nSo I always match the picture in my ID\nThey packin' Dub C had ran with Mack 10\nI was still a baby Similac then\nAnd what the crack era did to black men\nIt had to be an error if you had a Cadillac then\n\nHow I rock mine, I throw it up\nMakin' sure that you niggas all are on the same page\nPowerful force, you better look both ways\nFuck that, I'm chokin' niggas, it's goin' down\nI'm from a different cloth, we the oracles of the sounds\nSkip town, hit 'em with impeccable pound\nLost, found, the way I flood it, niggas gon' drown\nRip shit\u2014ayo, wait, wait, wait, wait\u2014\nI gotta do it again, I gotta do it again\nYou already know the script, roundhouse kick\nShe lookin' at me, lickin' her lip\nPut my arm around her like a bowl of chip with a dip\nWith yo' bitch, what the fuck, niggas erupt\nI got the half moon clip, that's banana\nA good planner, a new anger like a larger Bruce Banner\nOut the house, nigga, if you open your mouth\nMan, nigga, if you open your mouth\nFuck the press, I'm leavin' every room in a mess\nLike herds of bulls with they aprons on and bakin' soda\nKeep it movin', keep the convo short\nAnd bring a case of Henney (case of Henney)\nHouse of pain, I control many (control many)\nHouse of lies, you niggas go run, hide\nPeep the way this vibe conflict with they real lives\n(Nigga) Fanatic shit, we go bizarre (we go bizarre)\nBad news for niggas as I go emphatical, radical\nNational animal rulin' like a czar\nEvery time I black for the record, the shit splatter\nThe whole batter, no bullshit, the boom bapper\nI pull the gat up, whip the shit, cook the batter\nWhen I pull up on niggas, even your momma gon' scatter\nBarishkaaa"}}, {"title": "Money Maker", "album": "The Love Movement", "year": "1997-01-01", "lyrics": "This is the Lone

bound\nJust livin' like a hooker, the harlot sounds\nNow when I say the harlot, you know I mean the hot\nHeat in the equator, the brothers in the pot\nJalick, Jalick ya wind up ya hip\nDraftin' of the poets, I'm the number 7 pick\nLicks, licks, licks boy pon your backside\nLicks, licks, licks boy pon your backside\nListen to the fader, Shaheed lets it glide\nTip the earthly body, heaven's on my side\nEven in Santo Domingo, man, I got a Gringo\nYo, we got mics, when do we go?\nKnow a little nigga who can rhyme when you ask, B\nShort, dark, and plus his voice is raspy\n\nOne for the treble, two for the bass\nYou know my style Tip, now watch me rip this\nI like my beats harder than two day old shit\nSteady eatin' booty MCs like cheese grits\nMy man Al B. Sure, he's in effect mode\nUsed to have a crush on Dawn from En Vogue\nIt's not like honey dip would wanna get with me\nBut just in case I own more condoms than TLC\nNow the formula is this: me, Tip, and Ali\nFor those who can't count it goes 1-2-3\nThe anti ... big up,  it's who I be\nBrothas find it's hard to do, but never me\nSome brothas try to diss Malik\u2014you see'm catchin' me?\nNot care about them booty MC's, my shit be hittin'\nTrini gladiator, anti-hesitator\nShaheed'll push the fader from here to Granada\nMister energetic\u2014who me, sound pathetic?\nWhen's the last time you heard a funky diabetic?\nI don't know, man; I don't know, man; I don't know, man\nI don't know, I don't know, what, it go...\n\nOh my God ... oh my God ... oh my God ... oh my God\nOh my God ... oh my God ... oh my God ... oh my God\nOh my God ... oh my God ... oh my God ... oh my God\nOh my God ... oh my God ... oh my God ... oh my God\n\nComplimentary, are we, the thief of Poetry\nI got a humdinger comin' hook, line and sinker\nThe Timbo hoofs with the prints underground\nTimbo's on the toes, I love the way it's goin' down\nDown like a lady of the evenin'\nAnd when it goes in, honey, just believe it's in\n'Cause Queens is the county, Jamaica is the place\n(Take off your cleats 'cause you can't run the race)\nYeah, this is how we do when we keep it on and on\nDo what...\nGot my man Big Mo with the streets and the freaks\nMy man Big Mo with the streets and the freaks\nThis is how we do when we keep it wild in the sheets\n'Cause we got to do it like this, we aim to please\nSee ya next LP and next CD, and next cassette\nYo, we about to jet\nWe A Tribe Called Quest and we the Midnight Marauders\nTribe Called Quest and we the Midnight Marauders\nSee ya next time 'cause we the Midnight Marauders\nA yo, we out 'cause we the Midnight Marauders\nGo to the record store and get the shit\nWe work hard on it\nWe A Tribe Called Quest and we the Midnight Marauders\nQueens got a

ripping mics a-yo it ain't no games\nOne-wa-wa-one, one two one two (Repeat x2)\n\nA-yo you know it's Busta Rhymes, every time\nOh yes, I'm coming wicked with a new design, I'm saying\nOne-wa-wa-one, one two one two (Repeat x2)\n\nEmcees ain't coming equipped with the rhymes\nDon't do the crime if you can't do the time\nThe time is eternal when you play with the miser\nSoul is in my body and the health make me wiser\nThe tantalizing wordplay, yeah that's the joint\nSometimes I have to cuss just to prove my damn point\nBrothers need to come with better compositions\nI write and recite to make good position\nIn this rap game here we engineer\nStabbing up the jam, yeah son, shit's clear\nAnd I be kicking rhymes in my own damn way\nBeating niggas to the punch like Sugar Ray\nGot the cool-ass style that's cooler than the cool\nMy lyrics is the bullet and the mic is the tool\nPeace to C-73 and C-74\nDo a little something when I'm out on tour\nComing through like narcotics for the antibiotics\nFlap a shorty's pockets to the space like Sprockets\nWhat you really need to do is just boogie your ass\nIt's not gas, we got to make the good times last\nLet the good times roll cause we in control\nTake you out on your hide less you paying a toll\nLet the good times roll, let the good times roll\nTake you out on your hide less you paying the toll\n\nQuestion, why is that emcees be wack\nAnd major labels wanna sign all that crap, a-yo funk that!\nWord to life I'm coming rugged\nCause once you add the hip to the hop kid, it equals out to love\nIf the beat's fat I use it, some wack shit, I lose it\nRefuse it, how could you chose it, it stinks remove it\nPut down the mic kid, cause you gets no dap\nHow long did it take for you to see you can't rap\nThe name is Phife Dawg and I got nuff styles\nIt doesn't take long for me to get buckwild\nSo bust what I'm swinging what I'm swinging when I swing\nI rap when I rap cause I never wanna sing\nGo ask the last emcee what happened when he said battle\nI bust his ass in Cleveland now he's sleepless in Seattle\nRude bwoy official coming with the ill grammar\nComing back on kids like Joey Montana\nWe be the three emcees that make your mind go batty\nMad play on WKRP in Cincinatti\nSo lord send a hand and if you can't send a hand, send a man\nAnd if you can't send a man, come yourself\nCause all these biting emcees, lord them something else\nSee I kick the styles that'll make your ass melt\nMoney on my mind so never mind a trick\nNew York is the town and the team is the Knicks\nWorld's greatest five footer ripping parties apart\nHere comes Shaheed with the big green shark\nNever had to rhyme about filling one with lead\nNever mind that, man, here come the dread!\n\nWe coming far far far\nBusta Rhymes is coming far far far, you know you hear me, star\nBet your bottom dollar\nRight after this jam about one million one two niggas gon' follow\nWhether it be today or tomorrow\nNiggas become aggravating, sickening, you beat them like they father\nOh shit check out what I'm saying\nA-ha a-ha oh a-ha a-ha you know my niggas don't be playing\nOnce upon a motherfucking time\nI received the opportunities to represent my first rhymes\nTo define, lyrical sensations\nBlack masons blowing up the spot just to represent the Nations\nThree dimensions, tryclops, Mr. Busta Rhymes three eyes\nFat like a burger and fries\nMama-so mama-sa mama makossa\nGo back to the country to go check my grandmama\nEeeyah! Bring it to the table at the meetings\nGathering large receivings, delivering intellectual ass beatings\nAs I carry on with my proceedings\nGreetings! Watch a nigga debut on premier movie screenings\nBut before I be face to face with my eternal resting place\nI hope you find civilized every soul and every race\nSit dog sit!

Q-Tip, you know I get down\nYes I rock to the rhythm of a funky sound, it go\nOne-wa-wa-one, one two one two (Repeat x2)\n\nAnd it's the, Phife Dawg, and I do the same\nAnd when it comes to ripping mics a-yo it ain't no games\nOne-wa-wa-one, one two one two (Repeat x2)\n\nA-yo you know it's Busta Rhymes, every time\nOh yes, I'm coming wicked with a new design, I'm saying\nOne-wa-wa-one, one two one two (Repeat x2)\n\nEmcees ain't coming equipped with the rhymes\nDon't do the crime if you can't do the time\nThe time is eternal when you play with the miser\nSoul is in my body and the health make me wiser\nThe tantalizing wordplay, yeah that's the joint\nSometimes I have to cuss just to prove my damn point\nBrothers need to come with better compositions\nI write and recite to make good position\nIn this rap game here we engineer\nStabbing up the jam, yeah son, shit's clear\nAnd I be kicking rhymes in my own damn way\nBeating niggas to the punch like Sugar Ray\nGot the cool-ass style that's cooler than the cool\nMy lyrics is the bullet and the mic is the tool\nPeace to C-73 and C-74\nDo a little something when I'm out on tour\nComing through like narcotics for the antibiotics\nFlap a shorty's pockets to the space like Sprockets\nWhat you really need to do is just boogie your ass\nIt's not gas, we got to make the good times last\nLet the good times roll cause we in control\nTake you out on your hide less you paying a toll\nLet the good times roll, let the good times roll\nTake you out on your hide less you paying the toll\n\nQuestion, why is that emcees be wack\nAnd major labels wanna sign all that crap, a-yo funk that!\nWord to life I'm coming rugged\nCause once you add the hip to the hop kid, it equals out to love\nIf the beat's fat I use it, some wack shit, I lose it\nRefuse it, how could you chose it, it stinks remove it\nPut down the mic kid, cause you gets no dap\nHow long did it take for you to see you can't rap\nThe name is Phife Dawg and I got nuff styles\nIt doesn't take long for me to get buckwild\nSo bust what I'm swinging what I'm swinging when I swing\nI rap when I rap cause I never wanna sing\nGo ask the last emcee what happened when he said battle\nI bust his ass in Cleveland now he's sleepless in Seattle\nRude bwoy official coming with the ill grammar\nComing back on kids like Joey Montana\nWe be the three emcees that make your mind go batty\nMad play on WKRP in Cincinatti\nSo lord send a hand and if you can't send a hand, send a man\nAnd if you can't send a man, come yourself\nCause all these biting emcees, lord them something else\nSee I kick the styles that'll make your ass melt\nMoney on my mind so never mind a trick\nNew York is the town and the team is the Knicks\nWorld's greatest five footer ripping parties apart\nHere comes Shaheed with the big green shark\nNever had to rhyme about filling one with lead\nNever mind that, man, here come the dread!\n\nWe coming far far far\nBusta Rhymes is coming far far far, you know you hear me, star\nBet your bottom dollar\nRight after this jam about one million one two niggas gon' follow\nWhether it be today or tomorrow\nNiggas become aggravating, sickening, you beat them like they father\nOh shit check out what I'm saying\nA-ha a-ha oh a-ha a-ha you know my niggas don't be playing\nOnce upon a motherfucking time\nI received the opportunities to represent my first rhymes\nTo define, lyrical sensations\nBlack masons blowing up the spot just to represent the Nations\nThree dimensions, tryclops, Mr. Busta Rhymes three eyes\nFat like a burger and fries\nMama-so mama-sa mama makossa\nGo back to the country to go check my grandmama\nEeeyah! Bring it to the table at the meetings\nGathering large receivings, delivering intellectual ass beatings\nAs I carry on with my proceedings\nGreetings! Watch a nigga debut on premier movie screenings\nBut before I be face to face with my eternal resting place\nI hope you find civilized every soul and every race\nSit dog sit! Busta Rhymes forever on that ultrasonic shit"}}, {"title": "Pad & Pen", "album": "The Love Movement", "year": "1998-09-29", "lyrics": "This is the master D-Life\nAs we set it off with my mans A Tribe Called Quest\nAnd uhh, we got to do it like this baby\nWe got to do it like that baby\nWe got the good shit not the bullshit, You know what I mean? Ha hah\nWe bout to count it down, we bout to count it off\nIt goes a-one, two, three, and...\n\nMalik we gettin back into that shit again\nAnd when we rhyme, brothers need to break they pens, uh-oh\nIt's The Love Movement never ends\nThe rap game'll never be the same again\n(Phife Dawg where you at baby?) We came again\n\nHere I come again, you feelin fine?\nThe Dawg is like a overflowin rhyme from mind\nUsually mess with shorties whose a 8 or 9\nShorty bump around to the bass-line\n\nF keeps a burner on the waist-line\nY'all cat's trick it off, I ain't wastin mine\nYou feel the uniqueness, you seekin this?\nAnd when we do it, we be freakin this\n\nDon't even front, you know you feelin this\nMy shade is borderin around licorice (licorice)\nEnjoyin this tune, glad you playin it\n(Aiyyo Phife what's the hook?)\nHere we sayin it, SAYIN IT, SAYIN IT\nChorus: with D-Life\nMy pad and my pen (ah ah, you didn't go there)\nThe beat and the blend (say word, you didn't go there)\nThe party won't end (you know, we got to be there)\nJust keep gettin' ends, buildin with friends, yo\n* repeat 2X w/

the part you really like\nBrothers hold the cracks now they holdin mics\nThe cusses you get, they feelin steady rights\nMarauders, we did that shit at Mid-night, a-ah-aight-aight\n\nI love it when my honeydip be slobbin me\nDon't take it personal, it's just comedy\nMy comedy completely turned to tragedy\nI sense some of these rappers still be mad at me\nSweatin her because of her anatomy\nWhen I bang you it'll be assault and battery\nDon't make me discombobulate your microphone\nTalkin trash will only get you freakin head, flown\n\nUhh, buy em out the box, never batty ones\nGet in that ass like karate son\nMy outlook on life, sometimes it's lookin grim\nWe manage a smile, sometimes we slip it in\n\nMy Tribe be worldwide like the Nike swoosh\nEmcees be soundin moist like vagina juice\nThe top of the world, we pursuin it\nDon't worry about a thing, cause we doin it\nDOIN IT, DOIN IT\nChorus 2X\n\nThat's the way we do.. c'mon, that's the way we do\nIt's the nigga D-Life, with T-C-Q\nThat's the way we are.. and the beat won't stop\nGot to blow it up for the top..\nDidn't think you knew how we rock..", "image":

little paper\nObjects, they seem greater\nBut I'm sure we overcome when we illin' on a drum\n\nWe in a world that places heavy emphasis on money synthesis\nY'all can be my witnesses\nThat a fella fascination with money has grown\nTo the point that he will shit on his own\nWe got to have it y'all, its not a Spike Lee cinematic\nA piece of paper making niggas get dramatic\nBut the money doesn't come automatic\nGotta motivate ourselves to go and grab it\nWe got to get it y'all, in an orderly fashion\nSome cats go about it with too much passion\nWe got to mediate our greedy levels\n'Cause the lust of currency can have us sleepin with the devil\nGotta recognize it, realize the power\nThat this little ma-huckin piece of paper will devour\nMan can be greater than the thing he creates\nSee, I'mma do my thing and see how much I can scrape\nYo, I'd rather have respect than money, no doubt\nBut listen to me y'all, I want the mass amount\nThat the Sesame Street Dracula can't Count\nSo that I can give my people when that thing surmounts\nTo higher levels.. of being.. so when I'm MC-ing\nI hope to see you there steady G-ing (say word)\nBut the only way we can truly reach that goal\nIs finding true inner peace and prospering souls\nIt's like that\n\n\nHere comes your royal highness, one of Queens finest\nBelieve me, honest, you know you can't stop it\nCome on son, never leave your mic 'round me\nTrue MC for real, ask my man Shaheed\nStrictly focused on what I'm in this rap game for\nNot for fame and screwing every whore after whore\nWith all that AIDS stuff going round\nTell me how that sound\nRather hit the studio and hear some beats that pound\nNow, don't get me wrong, I love honeys galore\nBut see hip-hop's my bread butter\n'Cause that's what I get paid for\nSee this is what I wanted, Allah helped me to get it\nAnd if the beat is wicked, you know Malik will rip it\nFrom the bottom of my heart, that's where the love starts\nThe love for breakdancing, my love for the art\nAnd with this love I do hip-hop from the soul\nA real MC, who never sweats how many copies are sold\nYeah, I want to go gold, platinum, uh-huh, etcetera\nBut why put out some wackness when no one will respect ya?\nI'm staying true, nuff respect to those that paved the way\nFrom Bambaataa down to Shah; that be my DJ\nWithout my peeps I don't know how the hell I'd make it, word\nSometimes I feel that my career is headed for the curb\nOne love for lending hand and giving all your help\nBelieving in me when I didn't believe in my own self\nThe Abstract with whom I'm always making rugged tunes\nKid Hood resting in heaven, I hope to see you soon\nI keep things hot and this year they're even hotter\nBig Mu and Shah, one day I'll take my shahada\nOut"}}, {"title": "People's Instinctive

battle\"\nIt kinda took me by surprise 'cause the brother was moving\nWit' his eyes on the prize, I said 'Screw it'\nI ain't got nuttin to lose but um\nBut I got to do this shit real quick so um\nHurry up kid, bust your joints and then I'll bust mine\nAnd I'll be out 'cause I got to see this hottie,' he said 'OK'\n'Now check it, check it out, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah'\nThat's what he said\nThen I came back and just fucked up his head\n'Cause yo, he thought an MC who was seen on TV\nCouldn't hold the shit down in New York City\nAyo, I showed his ass, then I went off on my task\nTo bless her ass Uptown, real MC's will hold it down\nYeah, yeah, sonny, to the beat like that\nYou wanna bring it to me, where you at?\n\nYes, dread, I had a similar situation\nWhen this kid tried to tell me I didn't deserve my occupation\nHe said I wasn't shit that I was soon to fall\nI looked him up and down, grab my crotch and said balls\nOf course he tried to bring it on the battling tip\nAnd you know me, you know I had to come out my shit\nTrying to lounge at the mall, me, Skeff and Mr. Walt\nAnd finally I banged his ass wit the verbal assault\nHe said a rhyme about his .45 and his nickel bags of weed\nThat's when I proceeded to give him what he needed\nTalking 'bout I need a Phillie right before I get loose\nPoor excuse, money please, I get loose off of orange juice\nPreferably Minute Maid 'cause that's exactly what it takes to write a rhyme, huh\nSo screw your nickels and your dimes\nBecause an MC like me be on TV\nDon't mean I can't hold my shit down in NYC\nPhony rappers who do not write\nPhony rappers who do not excite\nPhony rappers, you know they type\nPhony rappers, check it\n\nIt seems there's a sanitation, y'all full of trash talker\nSounding good, but money, can you be the dog walker?\nTalking 'bout your mic days and your breakdancing\nNot enhancing, you sound tired...\nOh, shit, I didn't know you like to play yourself in front'cha friends\nSitting there, lying to no end\nMC's for me make things happening\nTalk about a world but in a form of rapping\nWho will be the captain of this ship\nIf it goes down, don't you know you have to go wit it\nJust because you rhyme for a couple of weeks\nDoesn't mean that you've reach the MC's peak\nLet me stop sounding all bitter\nGhetto child, never be a quitter\nBut don't be a phony in the litter\nTake it as a letter from the better\nTake it from a man who used to rhyme in busted ass Jettas\n\nC: Yo, Phife, you need a condom\nP: Word to God\nMess around, I catch AIDS from MC's being on my nuts too hard\nC: 'Cause on my boulevard, you better bring your bodyguard\nP: And what's your boulevard?\nC: L.B., I represent naturally\nP: So don't step on the boulie if you know that you're phony\nOr else I'll bend that ass like elbow macaroni\n'Cause I gotta keep it real (gotta keep it real) Yep!\nA Tribe Called Quest, you see we never half step\nC: (So on your mark) Get ready, MC's be jetty\nMe and Phife be hangin' like Veronica and Betty\nArchie, Jughead, snuffing MC's\nFrom Brainslane down to Hempstead\nP: Yes 'Quence, see over\nHis rhyme style is older that a Chrysler Cordoba\nI'm wilder then the cats from Arizona\nVillanova, or, or, Kentucky\nWho's the next MC stepping up to try and bust me\nBring him here and boy, will I ever let him have it\nC: And when it comes to the microphone, don't even try to grab it\nWhat?!?!\n\n\u201cThis feeling of embarrassment\nThis shyness, this bashfulness\u2026\nIf you take that out of the people then these people will do whatever they want to do\nAnd that is the very definition of America\nA people who have no shame and therefore do whatever they want to do.\""}}, {"title": "Practice Session", "album": "The Lost Tribes", "year": null, "lyrics": "Ayo, yo,

out, Kool DJ Red Alert\nWith my man, Q-Tip\n\nIn the morning, woke up from sexual pleasures\nLooked at her sexual partner\nWho acquainted her acquaintance\nFive hours ago at a disco\nShe went lower than low, into limbo\nA thought crossed the mind, her, a bimbo\nShe answered no, so she had to go\u2014on with the program\nCredence, it seems that I've forgotten your name\nBut it seems that she's done the same\nAnd now something has happened\nSuddenly, she's been distracted\nBy something that has been attracted\nShe poked and poked and smacked at it\nThen she broke down and she scratched it\nNow, I think you understand\nClinic, saw the doctor flex his biceps\nThen he picked up a pair of forceps\nHer pretty face showed fright\nRight then and there, she fainted\nA really grim picture is painted\nThe brotha who she acquainted\nWas the enemy, scary ain't it?\nThe Pubic Enemy\n\nYEAH!\nLet me tell you more about pubic enemy\nAy, Q-Tip...\n\nOld King Cole was a merry old soul\nHad a lady queen, married since 18\nHe protested, that he was infested\nGet lots of love and he couldn't digest it\nAll propaganda, one big fat lie\nCuz I see the king with my very own eye\nSchemed and schemed like a crack fiend king\nAnd poppin up on the teammates scene\nAnd poppin and pimpin on hunnies with moneys\nWhole situation to me, was kinda funny\nHe hold the crown but not the jimmy hat\nNow he wears a frown and the jimmy hates that\nSo the fair maiden in the royal bedroom\nCaught the king scratchin, so she had to assume\nThat he got vicked by the enemy's trick\nThe thought of cheatin made the maiden so sick\nThat she screamed and screamed, went on and kept screamin\nThrew a pot and his dome was beamin\nYou could hear him yellin in the motherland\n\"Baby, baby please. Baby, understand.\"\nShe ignored and walked through the gate\nThe king is in the kingdom to await his fate...of the enemy\nThe Pubic Enemy\n\nPropmaster\u2014yeah?\nPlease listen to me\u2014what?\nSomething lurkin by the JimBrowski\nWho? Jenny?\nNo, not propulated\nA horrible creature that must be penetrated\nHe gets all into ya, then he tries to do ya\nYou better run fast, he's gonna pursue the...\nWhat? Yo listen here. Propmaster whiz, no one fears...\nOkay, bro, just thought I'd let ya know\nHow he lives and how he go\nWatch yourself when you're out on the run\nThe enemy is missed, we'll have too much fun\nThere's four friends of mine that thought they were bad\nAnd laid up this girl, so now, they're sad\nThey scratched and scratched like it was Saturday and...\n\nListen here, this is Cool DJ Red Alert\nKnown as the true, the only, the very one, the Propmaster\nThere's only one thing I gotta tell ya\nThere's a whole lotta propmasters out there\nYou know what I mean?\nShaheed a propmaster, Q-Tip a propmaster\nThe Jungle Brothers a propmaster\nBDP a propmaster\n45 King a propmaster\nI won't tell you nuthin' bout the ladies\nThey ain't no propmaster\nBut you know who's the main propmaster\u2014ME!"}}, {"title": "Pubic Enemy (Saturday Night Virus Discomix)", "album": "Revised Quest For The Seasoned Traveller", "year": "1990-12-31", "lyrics": "Q-Tip:\nIn the morning, woke up from sexual pleasures\nLooked at her sexual partner\nWho acquainted her acquaintance\nFive hours ago at a disco\nShe went lower than low, into limbo\nA thought crossed her mind, her, a bimbo\nShe answered no, so she had to go...\nOn with the program\nCreedence, it seems that I've forgotten your name\nBut it seems that she's done the same\nAnd now something has happened\nSuddenly, she's been distracted\nBy something that has been attracted\nShe poked and poked and smacked at it\nThen she broke down and she scratched it\nNow, I think you understand\nClinic, saw the doctor flex his biceps\nThen he picked up a pair of forceps\nHer pretty face showed fright\nRight then and there, she fainted\nA really grim picture is painted\nThe brother who she acquainted\nWas the enemy, scary ain't it?\nThe Pubic Enemy\nQ-Tip:\nOld King Cole was a merry old soul\nHad a lady queen, married since 18\nHe protested, that he was infested\nWith lots of love and he couldn't digest it\nAll propaganda, one big fat lie\nCause I seen the king with my very own eye\nSchemed the scheme like a crack fiend fiend\nAnd poppin up on the teenage scene\nAnd proppin and pimpin hunnies with moneys\nWhole situation to Tip, was kinda funny\nHe hold the crown but not the jimmy hat\nNow he wears a frown and the jimmy hates that\nSo the fair maiden in the royal bedroom\nCaught the king scratchin, so she had to assume\nThat he got vicked by the enemy's tricks\nThe thought of cheatin made the maiden so sick\nThat she screamed and screamed, went on and kept screamin\nThrew a pot and his dome was beamin\nYou could hear him yellin in the motherland\n\"Baby, baby please.

pleasures\nLooked at her sexual partner\nWho acquainted her acquaintance\nFive hours ago at a disco\nShe went lower than low, into limbo\nA thought crossed her mind, her, a bimbo\nShe answered no, so she had to go...\nOn with the program\nCreedence, it seems that I've forgotten your name\nBut it seems that she's done the same\nAnd now something has happened\nSuddenly, she's been distracted\nBy something that has been attracted\nShe poked and poked and smacked at it\nThen she broke down and she scratched it\nNow, I think you understand\nClinic, saw the doctor flex his biceps\nThen he picked up a pair of forceps\nHer pretty face showed fright\nRight then and there, she fainted\nA really grim picture is painted\nThe brother who she acquainted\nWas the enemy, scary ain't it?\nThe Pubic Enemy\nQ-Tip:\nOld King Cole was a merry old soul\nHad a lady queen, married since 18\nHe protested, that he was infested\nWith lots of love and he couldn't digest it\nAll propaganda, one big fat lie\nCause I seen the king with my very own eye\nSchemed the scheme like a crack fiend fiend\nAnd poppin up on the teenage scene\nAnd proppin and pimpin hunnies with moneys\nWhole situation to Tip, was kinda funny\nHe hold the crown but not the jimmy hat\nNow he wears a frown and the jimmy hates that\nSo the fair maiden in the royal bedroom\nCaught the king scratchin, so she had to assume\nThat he got vicked by the enemy's tricks\nThe thought of cheatin made the maiden so sick\nThat she screamed and screamed, went on and kept screamin\nThrew a pot and his dome was beamin\nYou could hear him yellin in the motherland\n\"Baby, baby please. Baby, understand.\"\nShe ignored and walked through the gate\nThe king is in the kingdom to await his fate...\nOf the enemy: the Pubic Enemy\nQ-Tip:\nEverybody get sweaten, a deep is still a threaten\nAbout the AIDS, that hate the aids, but still will be forgettin\nAbout the ??? like the rocky picture horror\nDon't move tracks, cause the pubic had the hour\nYou can get it from sleepin' in nasty dirty sheets and\nWearin' nasty clothes for oh about a weekend\nI suggest you do yourself a big favor\nThe press I keep questin, I'll be damned if I save ya\nPlease remember this: a kiss is just a kiss\nA hug is just a hug, but a bug ain't just a bug\nIf you get the bug, oh boy, you'll be buggin'\nYou'll regrets your moments even when you started lovin'\n....... Damn! After loving, just take it out\nDon't get so far to Q, man\nInspect yourself, protect yourself\nRespect yourself, then correct yourself\nMake sure you don't get hand by the man\nYo I'll leave man, damn"}}, {"title": "Push It Along", "album": "People's Instinctive Travels and the Paths of Rhythm", "year": "1990-04-17", "lyrics": "Q-Tip is my title, I don't think that it's vital\nFor me to be your idol, but dig this recital\nIf you can't envision a brother who ain't dissing\nSlinging this and that, 'cause this and that was missing\nInstead, it's been injected, the Tribe has been perfected\nOh yes, it's been selected, the art makes it protected\nAfrocentric living, Africans be givin'\nA lot to the cause, 'cause the cause has been risen\nSome brothers, they be flamming, thinking we ain't slammin'\nComing off like the days when we used to wear the tans and\nA blue-collar talker, hemisphere stalker\nA glass of OJ and a ten mile walk-a\nIf you're in a Jeep and you dig what you're hearing\nCan I get a beep and a side order of cheering?\nI am what I am, that's a tribal man\nWe all know the colors, we all must stand\nAs we start our travels, things they will unravel\n\"Que sera sera\", for this unit is like gravel\nWon't be gone for long, listen to the song\nIf you can't pull it, all ya gotta do is\u2014\n\nPush it along, push it along\nPush it along, yeah, push it along\n\nPut one up for the Phifer, it's time to decipher\nThe ills of the world make the situation lighter\nThe clock is always ticking, the systems should be kickin'\nLike Tip said in \"Ham and Eggs\", I eat chicken, chicken, chicken\nShould I release the lever, the lever of the clever\nEmbellish on the funk as we start to endeavor?\nThe roots of the rap filling up the gap\nWith the smash of a hand and a little toe tap\n\nThe boom, the bip\u2014the boom-bip\nIndicates to the brothers that we be on the flip tip\nPhonies start to crumble, funky rhythm rumbles\nThrough the dance-hall, but my anthem is humble\nIt's the nitty-gritty, my time is itty-bitty\nSo I kick the slash for the gipper and the witty\nThis ain't trial and error, more like tribin' era\nConstantly rude as some sort of tribal terror\nThe street can't depart from the bloody heart\nRepair the wear and tear, don't stop 'fore it starts\nWon't be gone for long, listen to the song\nIf you can't pull it, all ya gotta do is\u2014\n\nPush it along, push it along\nPush it along, yeah, push it along\n\nMarching off the project, we hope that you will subject\nIt's good to be an object and never, ever reject\nThe tribe who meanders with drunken propaganda\nKeep it in boom and never will we slander\nRedeems should be handed, don't let me demand it\nMoney gives a nudge to the poet star bandit\nControl it, then recluse it, follow, you won't lose it\nMysterious is the tribe for we choose it\nAlthough she's flipping crazy, give my love to Gracie\nGod, could you help 'cause this Quest is crazy spacey?\nThe pigs are wearing blue, and in a year or two\nWe'll be going up the creek in a great big canoe\nWhat we gonna do, save me and my brothers?\nHop inside the bed and pull over the covers\nNever will we do that and we ain't trying to rule that\nWe just want a slab of the ham, don't you know, black?\nThis society of fake reality\nAre nothing but a peg of informality\nWhile I sing my song, sing it all day long\nIf you can't pull it, all ya gotta do is\u2014\n\nPush it along, push it along\nPush it along, yeah, push it along", "image": "https://images.genius.com/6527566f22d216ea6df0175321c3e473.997x1000x1.png", "artist": "A Tribe Called Quest", "raw": {"annotation_count": 18, "api_path": "/songs/44697", "description": {"dom": {"tag": "root", "children": [{"tag": "p", "children": ["Samples from", {"tag": "br"}, "", {"tag": "em", "children": ["Get Out My Life Woman\" by The Leaves", {"tag": "br"}, ""]}, "\u201cI\u2019m Gonna Love You Just a Little More, Babe\u201d by Jimmy Smith (from the 1973 album Black Smith)", {"tag": "br"}, "", {"tag": "em", "children": ["\u201cLoran\u2019s Dance\u201d by Grover Washington, Jr. (from the 1979 album Reed Seed)", {"tag": "br"}, ""]}, "\u201cThank You (Falletinme Be Mice Elf Agin)\u201d by Junior Mance (from the 1970 album With a Lotta Help from My Friends)", {"tag": "br"}, "", {"tag": "em", "children": ["\u201cGonna Love You (Skit)\u201d by J.

my title, I don't think that it's vital\nFor me to be your idol, but dig this recital\nIf you can't envision a brother who ain't dissing\nSlinging this and that, 'cause this and that was missing\nInstead, it's been injected, the Tribe has been perfected\nOh yes, it's been selected, the art makes it protected\nAfrocentric living, Africans be givin'\nA lot to the cause, 'cause the cause has been risen\nSome brothers, they be flamming, thinking we ain't slammin'\nComing off like the days when we used to wear the tans and\nA blue-collar talker, hemisphere stalker\nA glass of OJ and a ten mile walk-a\nIf you're in a Jeep and you dig what you're hearing\nCan I get a beep and a side order of cheering?\nI am what I am, that's a tribal man\nWe all know the colors, we all must stand\nAs we start our travels, things they will unravel\n\"Que sera sera\", for this unit is like gravel\nWon't be gone for long, listen to the song\nIf you can't pull it, all ya gotta do is\u2014\n\nPush it along, push it along\nPush it along, yeah, push it along\n\nPut one up for the Phifer, it's time to decipher\nThe ills of the world make the situation lighter\nThe clock is always ticking, the systems should be kickin'\nLike Tip said in \"Ham and Eggs\", I eat chicken, chicken, chicken\nShould I release the lever, the lever of the clever\nEmbellish on the funk as we start to endeavor?\nThe roots of the rap filling up the gap\nWith the smash of a hand and a little toe tap\n\nThe boom, the bip\u2014the boom-bip\nIndicates to the brothers that we be on the flip tip\nPhonies start to crumble, funky rhythm rumbles\nThrough the dance-hall, but my anthem is humble\nIt's the nitty-gritty, my time is itty-bitty\nSo I kick the slash for the gipper and the witty\nThis ain't trial and error, more like tribin' era\nConstantly rude as some sort of tribal terror\nThe street can't depart from the bloody heart\nRepair the wear and tear, don't stop 'fore it starts\nWon't be gone for long, listen to the song\nIf you can't pull it, all ya gotta do is\u2014\n\nPush it along, push it along\nPush it along, yeah, push it along\n\nMarching off the project, we hope that you will subject\nIt's good to be an object and never, ever reject\nThe tribe who meanders with drunken propaganda\nKeep it in boom and never will we slander\nRedeems should be handed, don't let me demand it\nMoney gives a nudge to the poet star bandit\nControl it, then recluse it, follow, you won't lose it\nMysterious is the tribe for we choose it\nAlthough she's flipping crazy, give my love to Gracie\nGod, could you help 'cause this Quest is crazy spacey?\nThe pigs are wearing blue, and in a year or two\nWe'll be going up the creek in a great big canoe\nWhat we gonna do, save me and my brothers?\nHop inside the bed and pull over the covers\nNever will we do that and we ain't trying to rule that\nWe just want a slab of the ham, don't you know, black?\nThis society of fake reality\nAre nothing but a peg of informality\nWhile I sing my song, sing it all day long\nIf you can't pull it, all ya gotta do is\u2014\n\nPush it along, push it along\nPush it along, yeah, push it along"}}, {"title": "Q-Tip's

am a bonafide\nNot too modest and not a lot of pride\nSoon to have a ride and a home to reside\nIf my mama is sick I'm by her bedside\nUsed to watch the show on Channel 4 called Riptide\nWash my wears in Tide cause it's too damn cold out-tide\nThat's how the runnings go\nIf there ain't no dough then there ain't no show\nSo take your roly poly fat promoter (ass)\nTo the Chemical Bank, and get my cash\nIf you wanna see the people scream and laugh\nYou best Quest, you ask the Quest, you ask real fast\nCause I don't wanna see 'em, start bucking\nThrowing chairs in the air while you be ducking\nWhat what? Don't step to me with that\nIf you promoting a show make sure it ain't wack\nOr else I'm leaving (\"Let me tell you\")\nI'm leaving (\"Let me tell you\")\nI'm leaving (\"Let me tell you\")\nYour wack show\n\nYo man what's up with that?\nYo don't sweat me\nC'mon, five hundred, that was the deal\nC'mon man, don't try to play me out\nWe don't need you, sorry!\nAnd the Abstract rapper says\n\nI want chicken and orange juice, that's what's on my rider\nAnd my occasional potato by Ore-Ida\nDon't forget my pastry make sure they're tasty\nI'm not the type to be pushy or hasty\nSee I'm the type of bro that's reared in the ghetto\nTook a few shorts before\nNow the only ones I take are the ones that I wear\nAin't taking no shorts no more, now\nPlease act proper 'fore I call the CrimeStoppers\nDon't dip on the dough, cause that's a no-no\nMake sure you count your money real slow\nBe alert, look alive, and act like you know\nIt's, the 90s, time to make moves\nNot, the 80s, do away witcha womb\nSo what? You got a crew\nI got one too, they're called the Brooklyn Zu\nDon't break fool, let's be reserved and cool\nWe don't have to act like we in grade school\nJust make sure that we're taken care of\nAnd we'll do a fly show for ya bub, check it out\n\nDiggy dang diggy dang gi-dang gi-dang diggy diggy\nDang diggy dang gi-dang gi-dang diggy diggy\nDang diggy dang gi-dang gi-dang diggy diggy\nDang diggy

new decade\nThe Native Tongues are about to proceed with the usual lingo\nThe usual rhythm\n\nDevoted to, the art of moving butts\nThe rhythm's happening, and it's moving up\nThe Tribe has been on hold for much too long\nDon't fear the rhythm because it's strong\nOn the corners, brothers bop their heads\nFrom the high-tops to the natty dreads\nI'm a nubian y'all, look what we did\nTook the crust away from the third eyelid\nNow it's kinda open, longs to see the sight\nRhythms of the Tribe which is passed outright\nNight after night, day after day\nQuesting for the rhythms of the Native Tongue way\nRhythm is the key as we open up the door\nThings a B-boy has never seen before\nPoly-rhythm addict with a big fat boom\nYou have an eargasm as you start to consume\nThe ghetto beat with a ghetto poem\nYeah, it's from the heart, cos it's from the home\nJarobi, Phife, Ali Shaheed\nCall me Koala, got what you need\nYou're a disc jock, then jock this\nRhythms can't lose, rhythms can't miss\nIf you feel uptight and you need to freak\nIt'll be alright once we drop this beat\n\nI got the rhythm, you got the rhythm (Repeat x8)\n\nMa Massa-ya, Ma Makossa\nGets hectic, freak a bourgeois\nWe quest around for the musical heart\nOn avenues, streets and boulevards\nNot selling out, that's a negative\nLoving Hip Hop, loving heritage\nGot the instinct to travel miles and miles\nGotta whole lot of rhythm, piles and piles\nNow you're kinda with it, wanna get the funk\nFrom the Zulu Nation, topping all the junk\nStanding on the top like the Temptations said\nRhythms are obese, yeah, you gotta keep 'em fed\nRead what I read, can't be better said\nTribe'll lick motions dabble in the head\nSweetback's bad, not as bad as a beat\nIt's a (stone groove baby)\nContinue, on the windy road\nBut, I'm lugging, a crazy big load\nWill we be on point for the ninety dec\nIs it muscle bound and will it flex?\nBut trudging, we are used to\nYou don't Quest alone, Quest with a crew\nWe're four, once more, must make the tracks\nYou see four fronts, but now you see four backs", "image": "https://images.genius.com/6527566f22d216ea6df0175321c3e473.997x1000x1.png", "artist": "A

with the usual lingo\nThe usual rhythm\n\nDevoted to, the art of moving butts\nThe rhythm's happening, and it's moving up\nThe Tribe has been on hold for much too long\nDon't fear the rhythm because it's strong\nOn the corners, brothers bop their heads\nFrom the high-tops to the natty dreads\nI'm a nubian y'all, look what we did\nTook the crust away from the third eyelid\nNow it's kinda open, longs to see the sight\nRhythms of the Tribe which is passed outright\nNight after night, day after day\nQuesting for the rhythms of the Native Tongue way\nRhythm is the key as we open up the door\nThings a B-boy has never seen before\nPoly-rhythm addict with a big fat boom\nYou have an eargasm as you start to consume\nThe ghetto beat with a ghetto poem\nYeah, it's from the heart, cos it's from the home\nJarobi, Phife, Ali Shaheed\nCall me Koala, got what you need\nYou're a disc jock, then jock this\nRhythms can't lose, rhythms can't miss\nIf you feel uptight and you need to freak\nIt'll be alright once we drop this beat\n\nI got the rhythm, you got the rhythm (Repeat x8)\n\nMa Massa-ya, Ma Makossa\nGets hectic, freak a bourgeois\nWe quest around for the musical heart\nOn avenues, streets and boulevards\nNot selling out, that's a negative\nLoving Hip Hop, loving heritage\nGot the instinct to travel miles and miles\nGotta whole lot of rhythm, piles and piles\nNow you're kinda with it, wanna get the funk\nFrom the Zulu Nation, topping all the junk\nStanding on the top like the Temptations said\nRhythms are obese, yeah, you gotta keep 'em fed\nRead what I read, can't be better said\nTribe'll lick motions dabble in the head\nSweetback's bad, not as bad as a beat\nIt's a (stone groove baby)\nContinue, on the windy road\nBut, I'm lugging, a crazy big load\nWill we be on point for the ninety dec\nIs it muscle bound and will it flex?\nBut trudging, we are used to\nYou don't Quest alone, Quest with a crew\nWe're four, once more, must make the tracks\nYou see four fronts, but now you see four backs"}}, {"title": "Rock Rock Y'all", "album": "The Love Movement", "year": "1998-09-29", "lyrics": " Yo!

style out\nLife situations are the ones I speak about\nIt seems cats nowadays be gettin' introduced to courage\nDon't get discouraged 'cause my words are fluid like flourish\nWe got the bounty, we from the Queens county\nOverlookin' things like a Rushmore Mounty\nAnd got no other choice except to get a little love\nWe rise above, the beat be fittin' like a glove\nThe pain in my heart is getting dosed by joy\nWe have no other ploy but to bring the B-boy\nThere's nothing on this Earth that can instill fear\nThe locomotive, puttin' my thing in gear\nI only have the fear of God and that's taqwa\nYou need Binaca; your trap is blazing like Blanka\nI got the lethal, you couldn't put a match to it\nLet me know, yo, where we could do it like Stuart\nMind over matter, action is needed\nWhen the big one not to be superseded\nResponsibility is somethin' I can't deny\nThe illegalties is the nonsense reply\nMost cats who scramble do so because they want to\nBut known to kick rhymes in the past on impromptu\nMy willy's hot like two links in the skillet\nA room filled with speakers, one stage, watch me kill it\nKnowledge should be sought from the cradle to the grave\nRhyming opposition get it twist like Super Dave\nYou be looking bug just like Uncle Jesse\nDon't make the scene messy\n'Cause it'll jump, that's word to Aunt Bessie\nProfound sentences of pure lyric gems\nSome of my friends be liking people with stems\nFolks be on the chase for this cheddar\nThinkin' it makes your life better\nBut it can make you ass out\nAnd when I'm at a show chicks never pass out\nWe got the joints to make the whole Mash Out out\nA Tribe Called Quest make the party go down\nPlus we bring positive vibes to fill up all your crowns\nLyrics comes to cats like a hot and cold flash\nSome can come with ease, therefore, it's in a smash\nHeld the fort down like the Justice League hall of Super Friends\nBut in the world turmoil spins\nBrothers walk the street with the ill pace face\nCity life breeds contempt for each race\nAll praises due to Allah and I should say it\nIt's The Abstract motivator making things clear\nPuttin' things in perspective to rock and roll\n'Cause you know this kid has got wild soul\nAmericana makes drama like starved-out piranha\nCold like ice, jet hot like a sauna\nIt's the haves verse the have-not\nAnd guess who's arrived in the hood\nExposing all wrongs, it's all good\nAyo, word up, hip-hop is live like a wire\nLet's get a little bit before the whole joint expire\nI got to stress it again, this here is for my kin\nAnd all my babies, children of the world, no maybe's\nSo, yo, we gotta move through and push through\nBecause we gotta make it happen, keep it true blue\nIt's like that\nSo much confusion goin' on\nSo much confusion goin' on\nInside all mine\nInside all mine\nSo much confusion goin' on\nUh, uh, uh, uh\nBut everything will be fine\nSo much confusion goin' on\nSo much confusion goin' on\nGotta make it alright\nGotta make it alright\nGotta elevate your mind\nElevate your mind\nElevate your mind\nElevate your mind\nElevate your mind\nElevate your mind\nElevate your mind"}}, {"title": "Scenario", "album": "The Low End

do the show business?\nAnd you think that you got what it takes?\nI mean you really gotta rap, and be all that\nAnd prepare yourself for the breaks\nCheck it out!\n\nDo you wanna be in the business? (The business)\nThe ups and downs with the hoes (The business)\nAlways getting fronted on at shows (The business)\nPeople gotta stick their nose (In the business)\n\nYo, I gotta speak on the cesspool\nIt's the rap industry and it ain't that cool\nOnly if you're on stage or if you're speaking to your people\nAin't no-one your equal\nEspecially on the industry side\nDon't let the gains just glide\nRight through your fingers, you gotta know the deal\nSo Lord Jamar speak, because you're real\n\nThey're giving you the business and putting on a show\nYou're a million dollar man that ain't got no dough\nBut you got a ho tickets backstage to a show\nSedated and at that fact they elated\nTime pass and your ass say \"Where's my loot?\"\nThe reply is a kick in the ass from a leg and a boot\nAll you wanna do is taste the fruit\nBut in the back they're making fruit juice\nYou ask for slack and wanna get cut loose from the label\nNot able cause you signed at the table\nFor a pretty cash advance, now they got a song and dance\nThat you didn't recoup, \"More soup with your meal?\"\nCause this is the real when you get a record deal\nAnd I say...\n\nAw shucks, look what the cat hauled in\nIt's Phife Dawg from A Tribe Called Quest, let me begin\nLike Chuck D, I got so much trouble on my mind\n'Bout these no-talent artists getting signed, they can't rhyme\nAnd if that ain't bad, you got bootleggers\nGoing out like suckers, motherfuckers\nFeel it's time that I let loose the lion\nAnd if not that then I'll commence to head flying\nSeems in '91 everybody want a rhyme\nAnd then you go and sell my tape for only $5.99?\nPlease nigga, I've worked too hard for this\nNo more will I take the booty end of the stick\nBogus brothers making albums when they know they can't hack it\nCause they lyrics is played like 8-Ball jackets\nNow tell me I can't tear it up\nGo get yourself some toilet paper cause your lyrics is butt\n\nDo you wanna be in the business? (The Business)\nPeople can't walk a straight line in (The Business)\nSome of these brothers can't rhyme in (The Business)\nA-yo, I'm tryna get mine (The Business)\n\nThe party scene is cool, but then again it's all the same\nYou see the same faces, but at different places\nWhen you're up and riding high everything is palsy-palsy\nGet a million pounds and all the skins give you hugs\nWell that's cool, I can dig it, it really ain't my bag\nPrefer to max on the side and let my pants sag\n\"Oh, he's a cutie\", yeah, real cute\nBut I wasn't that cute when I didn't have no loot\nAlthough I hit a pound of herbs, I'm still nice with the verbs\nSo fuck what you heard\nThe Born Cipher Cipher Master makes me think much faster\nBut critics still continue to plaster\nMy name and discredit my fame\nAll that shit is game and I don't really give a damn\nEat from the tree of life and throw away the verbal ham\n\nWell, excuse me, I gotta add my two cents in\nDon't be alarmed, the rhyme was condensed in\nA matter of minutes so it must be told\nAll that glitters not gold\nEverybody wants a deal, help me make a demo\nSee my name in bright lights, ride around in a limo\nMy moms keeps beefing (\"Boy, get a job\")\nBut I wanna make jams, damn, I know I'll slam\nHuh, well it's not that easy\nYou gotta get a label that's willing and able\nTo market and promote, and you better hope\n(For what?)

see the pretty girls\nIn the high animated world\nChecking for a rapper with all the dough\nIf you take a shit they want to know\nAnd if you're gonna fall, they won't be around, y'all\nSo you still wanna do the show business?\nAnd you think that you got what it takes?\nI mean you really gotta rap, and be all that\nAnd prepare yourself for the breaks\nCheck it out!\n\nDo you wanna be in the business? (The business)\nThe ups and downs with the hoes (The business)\nAlways getting fronted on at shows (The business)\nPeople gotta stick their nose (In the business)\n\nYo, I gotta speak on the cesspool\nIt's the rap industry and it ain't that cool\nOnly if you're on stage or if you're speaking to your people\nAin't no-one your equal\nEspecially on the industry side\nDon't let the gains just glide\nRight through your fingers, you gotta know the deal\nSo Lord Jamar speak, because you're real\n\nThey're giving you the business and putting on a show\nYou're a million dollar man that ain't got no dough\nBut you got a ho tickets backstage to a show\nSedated and at that fact they elated\nTime pass and your ass say \"Where's my loot?\"\nThe reply is a kick in the ass from a leg and a boot\nAll you wanna do is taste the fruit\nBut in the back they're making fruit juice\nYou ask for slack and wanna get cut loose from the label\nNot able cause you signed at the table\nFor a pretty cash advance, now they got a song and dance\nThat you didn't recoup, \"More soup with your meal?\"\nCause this is the real when you get a record deal\nAnd I say...\n\nAw shucks, look what the cat hauled in\nIt's Phife Dawg from A Tribe Called Quest, let me begin\nLike Chuck D, I got so much trouble on my mind\n'Bout these no-talent artists getting signed, they can't rhyme\nAnd if that ain't bad, you got bootleggers\nGoing out like suckers, motherfuckers\nFeel it's time that I let loose the lion\nAnd if not that then I'll commence to head flying\nSeems in '91 everybody want a rhyme\nAnd then you go and sell my tape for only $5.99?\nPlease nigga, I've worked too hard for this\nNo more will I take the booty end of the stick\nBogus brothers making albums when they know they can't hack it\nCause they lyrics is played like 8-Ball jackets\nNow tell me I can't tear it up\nGo get yourself some toilet paper cause your lyrics is butt\n\nDo you wanna be in the business? (The Business)\nPeople can't walk a straight line in (The Business)\nSome of these brothers can't rhyme in (The Business)\nA-yo, I'm tryna get mine (The Business)\n\nThe party scene is cool, but then again it's all the same\nYou see the same faces, but at different places\nWhen you're up and riding high everything is palsy-palsy\nGet a million pounds and all the skins give you hugs\nWell that's cool, I can dig it, it really ain't my bag\nPrefer to max on the side and let my pants sag\n\"Oh, he's a cutie\", yeah, real cute\nBut I wasn't that cute when I didn't have no loot\nAlthough I hit a pound of herbs, I'm still nice with the verbs\nSo fuck what you heard\nThe Born Cipher Cipher Master makes me think much faster\nBut critics still continue to plaster\nMy name and discredit my fame\nAll that shit is game and I don't really give a damn\nEat from the tree of life and throw away the verbal ham\n\nWell, excuse me, I gotta add my two cents in\nDon't be alarmed, the rhyme was condensed in\nA matter of minutes so it must be told\nAll that glitters not gold\nEverybody wants a deal, help me make a demo\nSee my name in bright lights, ride around in a limo\nMy moms keeps beefing (\"Boy, get a job\")\nBut I wanna make jams, damn, I know I'll slam\nHuh, well it's not that easy\nYou gotta get a label that's willing and able\nTo market and promote, and you better hope\n(For what?) That the product is dope\nTake it from Diamond, it's like mountain climbing\nWhen it comes to rhyming you gotta put your time in\nGet a good lawyer so problems won't pile\nYou don't wanna make a pitch

with a twist of lime\nGotta meet your lover at a quarter to 9\nJoint by base, then you get your high\n\nIf you get your high, then mines is next\nThe 'S' in skypage really stands for sex\nBeeper's going off like Don Trump gets checks\nKeep my bases loaded like the New York Mets\nAt times I miss the pager so you don't get vex\nHaving bad days like a voodoo hex\nConceptually, a pager is so complex\nThat I be standing by the phone, ready to flex\n\nWelcome, wel-wel-welcome to the new skypager\nWel-welcome to the new skypager\nWelcome to the new skypager, new skypaper\nEnter telephone number or other numeric message\n\nUh, so funky\nUh, so funky\nUh, so funky\nUh, so funky\n\nThe batteries I use are called Duracell\nThey last for three weeks so they do me well\nDon't be going through no phases, my joint stays on\n24-7, from dusk til dawn\nIf you're in Costa Rica on a sunlit beach\nYou greed for the Phifer, I can be reached\nA number of importance, I just put it on

skypagers on all the time\nHurry up and get yours cause I got mine\nEspecially if you do shows, they come in fine\nIf you're with a G and you're sipping wine\nEating cacciatore with a twist of lime\nGotta meet your lover at a quarter to 9\nJoint by base, then you get your high\n\nIf you get your high, then mines is next\nThe 'S' in skypage really stands for sex\nBeeper's going off like Don Trump gets checks\nKeep my bases loaded like the New York Mets\nAt times I miss the pager so you don't get vex\nHaving bad days like a voodoo hex\nConceptually, a pager is so complex\nThat I be standing by the phone, ready to flex\n\nWelcome, wel-wel-welcome to the new skypager\nWel-welcome to the new skypager\nWelcome to the new skypager, new skypaper\nEnter telephone number or other numeric message\n\nUh, so funky\nUh, so funky\nUh, so funky\nUh, so funky\n\nThe batteries I use are called Duracell\nThey last for three weeks so they do me well\nDon't be going through no phases, my joint stays on\n24-7, from dusk til dawn\nIf you're in Costa Rica on a sunlit beach\nYou greed for the Phifer, I can be reached\nA number of importance, I just put it on lock\nYou leave code '69\", that means you want some (cock)\n\nPeople tend to think that a pager's foul\nWell it kinda is cause it makes me scowl\nBut it really hurts when you're on the prowl\nBrothas know it hurts when you're on the prowl\nGrabbin' on my joint cause I'm an eager owl\nGet paged by a G or a business pal\nMy shit is overflowin', they won't allow\nAnother page, so I'll just end this now\n\n(Message sent, thank you for calling skypager)"}}, {"title": "Solid Wall of Sound", "album": "We got it from Here...

fantasies and I'll look out like Tattoo\n\nOk, I am recognizing that the voice inside my head\nIs urging me to be myself but never follow someone else\nBecause opinions are like voices, we all have a different kind\nSo just clean out all of your ears, these are my views and you will find\nThat we revolutionize over the kick and the snare\nThe ghetto vocalist is on a state-wide tear\nSoon to be the continent and then the freaking globe\nThere's room for it all as we mingle at the mall\nWe welcome competition cause it doesn't make one lazy or worn\nWe gotta work hard, you know the damn card\nTry to be the phattest is the level that we strive\nTry to be the phattest also to stay alive", "image": "https://images.genius.com/834f36c594ae7b665086945b4f31282a.300x298x1.jpg", "artist": "A Tribe

other\nTrini-born lad like Nia Long's grandmother\nTip and Sha they all that, Phife Dawg ditto\nHoney tell your man to chill, or else you'll be a widow\nDid not you know that my styles are top-dollar?\nThe Five-Foot Assassin knocking fleas off his collar\nHip hop scholar since being knee high to a duck\nThe height of Muggsy Bogues, complexion of a hockey puck\nYou better ask somebody on how we flip the script\nCome to a Tribe show and watch the three kids rip\n\nQueens is in the house represent, represent\nA Tribe Called Quest represent, represent\nNo taming of the style cause it gets irreverent\nA Tribe Called Quest represent, represent\nHuh-huh, here we go, you know that I'm the rebel\nThrowing out the wicked like God did the Devil\nFunky like your grandpa's drawers, don't test me\nWe in like that, you're dead like Presley\nWhen we coming through get tickets to see me\nWe work for the paper so there'll never be a freebie\nLyrics are abundant cause we got it by the mass\nEgos are all idle cause the music is the task\nValenzuela on the pitch, curveball, catch it\nI think I got it locked, just smooth while I latch it\nRight, now I must move with the quickness\nHere comes Shaheed so we must bear the witness\n\nStir it up!

nines like September\nCrazy situations keeps pockets on slender\nYo, I be on the avenue where they be actin brand new\nI'm splurging on these Reebok joints for shorty boo\nAll of a sudden, I saw these two kids frontin'\nTalking out they joints but they wasn't saying nuttin'\nMy hand was on my toolie, they was actin unruly\n(Yo, say word) Yo, word up, yo, I was type caught up\nBut I swallowed my pride and let that nonsense ride\nBecause the positive it sees that negative die\nYo, we was at the dice game making these cats look silly\nFlamming, steady running off at my Willie\nI had my cash mixed, my rent due, with my play-dough\nI gotta see some loot so on my girls I blow\nShook them shits in my palm, let em hit the flo'\nKept my eyeballs scoping for them pigs po-po\nI got to go on the ave see my parole by fo'\nBut I gotta steady freak these boys like JoJo\nAnd I was doing it, til I met Ike, Spike, and Mike\nOne roll, they had my pockets thirstier than Sprite\nYo, I know the feeling, when you feeling like a villain\nYou be having good thoughts but the evils be revealin'\nAnd the stresses of life can take you off the right path (no doubt)\nJealousy and envy tends to infiltrate your staff\nWe gotta hold it down so we can move on past\nAll adversities, so we can get through fast, like that\n\n\nYou got the N.W.O. (with low cash flow)\nYour baby's on the way (and you don't know who)\nAnd crosstown killas trying to (bust at you)\nAyo they got me stressed out (and you don't know what to do)\n\nDunn-da-lie, dunn-da-lo, dunn-da-lie, dunn-da-lee\nMe no look for trouble but trouble done follow me\nAll I wanted to be was a illa MC\nEver since me was small as a youth out in Queens\nWhat did you mash on de dancehall (all a me)\nUntil my best friend caught two in him head (Right, scene)\nAnd ever since that day (ya not hear me?) things been a mess\nR.I.P Ghosta Rock, true ting, God bless\nSo nowadays I go see wifey just to cure me from stress\nLay my head on her breast\nSugar dumpling knows best\nExplaining all my problems to her getting things off my chest\nA little hook up, squeeze up, and no more am I vexxed\nAyo son, without my peeps I'd be truly assed out\nMake sure I have my medication so I wouldn't pass out\nNative Tongues for believing in me, when everyone was fessing\nMost of all Jah Mighty for the guidance and the blessings\n\n\nCome on baby, we gon make it (gonna make it)\nCome on baby, we gon make it (oh yeah)\nCome on baby, we gon make it (gonna make it)\nWe gon make it (gotta make it)\nCome on baby,  we gon make it (gonna make it)\nWe're gonna make it (we're gonna make it)\nCome on baby, we gon make it (we're gonna make it)\nWe're gonna make it (ohhhhhhh)\nCome on baby, we

make it (we're gonna make it)\nCome on baby, we gon make it (yeahhhh)\nWe gon make it (yeahhahhahhhh)\nCome on baby, we gon make it (we're gonna make it)\nWe've gotta make it (we've gotta make it)\nWe're gonna make it (oh yeah)\nI know we're gonna make it\nWe're gonna make it, gonna make it\nWe gotta make it, I know we gonna make it...\nGotta make it, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,

like they hard when we know they damn card\nWhat you figure, rhyme-wise I do the figure eight so concisely\nMusically we are the herb so sit back and light me\nInhale...\nMy style is kinda fat reminiscent of a whale\nYoung girls desires older female dreams\nI be the Abstract Poetic representing from Queens\nSocially I'm not inane, black and white got game\nIf you came to the jam, well I'm glad you came\nSee, nigga first was used back in the Deep South\nFalling out between the dome of the white man's mouth\nIt means that we will never grow, you know the word dummy\nUpper niggas in the community think it's crummy\nBut I don't, neither does the youth cause we em-\nBrace adversity it goes right with the race\nAnd being that we use it as a term of endearment\nNiggas start to bug, to the dome is where the fear went\nNow the little shorties say it all of the time\nAnd a whole bunch of niggas throw the word in they rhyme\nYo I start to flinch, as I try not to say it\nBut my lips is like the oowop as I start to spray it\nMy lips is like a oowop as I start to spray it\nMy lips is like a oowop as I start to spray the\n\nSucka nigga, nigga nigga\nI throw the sucka in the front for

kinda fat reminiscent of a whale\nYoung girls desires older female dreams\nI be the Abstract Poetic representing from Queens\nSocially I'm not inane, black and white got game\nIf you came to the jam, well I'm glad you came\nSee, nigga first was used back in the Deep South\nFalling out between the dome of the white man's mouth\nIt means that we will never grow, you know the word dummy\nUpper niggas in the community think it's crummy\nBut I don't, neither does the youth cause we em-\nBrace adversity it goes right with the race\nAnd being that we use it as a term of endearment\nNiggas start to bug, to the dome is where the fear went\nNow the little shorties say it all of the time\nAnd a whole bunch of niggas throw the word in they rhyme\nYo I start to flinch, as I try not to say it\nBut my lips is like the oowop as I start to spray it\nMy lips is like a oowop as I start to spray it\nMy lips is like a oowop as I start to spray the\n\nSucka nigga, nigga nigga\nI throw the sucka in the front for the ones that front\nIt's the neo-nigga of the nineties c'mon\n\nAiyyo Shaheed, take us the fuck outta here\nYou're not any less of a man, if you don't pull the trigger\nYou're not

par\nNo subliminals, with me you know who the fuck you are\nWho wanna spar? Haha, well, here I are\nOrthodox spitter or bring on the southpaw\nNo doubt I'mma set it, dudes best be ready\nOff top on the spot, no reading from your Whackberry\nLeave the iPhones home, skill sets must be shown\nI'mma show you the real meaning of the danger zone, huh\nI got it sewn, eh speak to all clones\nUntouchable in my zone, watch it, don't leave him alone\nFuck your ass cheek flows with bars sweeter than scones\nPut down microphone\n\nYes, yes, he the wrong ones to fuck with\nNo matter what the day\nHe could catch you on his plane or the one you on today\nVisit niggas in their dreams\nAnd make them scream of bloody murder\nHe's a Trini gladiator, ain't no need to take it further\nIf you wanna take it further your Huckleberry is here\nDoctor of your holiday, Wyatt Earp ya like the tears\nWe gon' celebreate him, elevate him, papa had to levitate him\nGive him his and don't debate him\nTop dog is the way to rate him\n\n\nDon Juice, Don Juice, Don Juice\nPhife Dawg what a

it to you kid like we never ever did\nMy nigga Al G in it, my nigga Shaheed in it\nWe got the girl Kristine in it, got my man Big G in it\n\nA-yo, inside the ghetto or in a sunny meadow\nI'mma make you move whether woman or fellow\nYo, I got the medals in the warfield of respect\nLike an ill porno make ya body get wet\nJust a ghetto child trying to live a straight and narrow\nHoping that my shit will pierce your dome like an arrow\nI'm sure it will, especially if it's God's will\nMC's be ready to die cause I'mma kill\nAll your negative feelings standing on two feet\nWhile I make the hotties move to the hip-hop beat\nYou know it's realer killer, realer than you can imagine\nUsing every source of pain in my range to make it happen\nIf I make it happen, that means I'm making motion\nAnd I'm doing my thing causing an ill commotion\nEverybody do the hop, make it smooth like lotion\nI lay up in the piece on a incognotion\n\nYou gotta do the hop, you move to the beat, you don't stop\nNow everybody here, you do the hop\nYou going up to cop, Uptown for a brick, don't stop\nYou gotta come back and do the hop\nYo, fuck the cops, you gotta come back and do the hop\nMove till your body won't stop\nYou gotta do the hop, non-stop motion, non-stop\nYou gotta come back and do the, do the...\n\nYou see you, your career is done like Johnny Carson's\nGet me vexed, I do like Left Eye, start an arson\nNow that I got that out my system\nWatch me stab up the track as if my name was OJ Simpson\nI packs it in like Van Halen\nI work for mine, you, you're freeloading like Kato Kaelin\nI'm representing with my crew\nMess around, bite my rhymes, I'll beat that ass with my shoe\nC'mon, you know I'm crazy nice\nBrothers can't deal with the shorty named Phife\nYou must be mad in the head\nI bust his ass and leave 'im bloodclot for dead\nNiggas sound like Das EFX\nIf it ain't Das EFX then they sounding like Meth\nYou might as well do Megadeth\nY'all punk MCs better save your freaking breath\nYou's a corny motherfucker\nYou must be high smoking dust with Chris Tucker\nY'all faggot asses don't want this\nI pull more peeps than the peeps at the premier of Pocohantas\nWord is bond I am the baddest\nAnd all you honies out there, word is bond, you know my status\nSo come and pull your panties down\nThis ain't the Barnum Bailey show, I don't get down with the clowns\nSo why don't you and your friends get with me and my friends\nBut don't bring your ass by and you ain't got no ends\nWord is bond it don't stop\nJust ease your mind, come along and do the hop\n\nYou gotta do the

just stop and do the hop\nThen you come back and do the hop\nYou know we don't stop, we on the ghetto prize on the top\nYou know we come back and do the hop\nShorties in the place, all the shorty

in it\nWe got the girl Kristine in it, got my man Big G in it\n\nA-yo, inside the ghetto or in a sunny meadow\nI'mma make you move whether woman or fellow\nYo, I got the medals in the warfield of respect\nLike an ill porno make ya body get wet\nJust a ghetto child trying to live a straight and narrow\nHoping that my shit will pierce your dome like an arrow\nI'm sure it will, especially if it's God's will\nMC's be ready to die cause I'mma kill\nAll your negative feelings standing on two feet\nWhile I make the hotties move to the hip-hop beat\nYou know it's realer killer, realer than you can imagine\nUsing every source of pain in my range to make it happen\nIf I make it happen, that means I'm making motion\nAnd I'm doing my thing causing an ill commotion\nEverybody do the hop, make it smooth like lotion\nI lay up in the piece on a incognotion\n\nYou gotta do the hop, you move to the beat, you don't stop\nNow everybody here, you do the hop\nYou going up to cop, Uptown for a brick, don't stop\nYou gotta come back and do the hop\nYo, fuck the cops, you gotta come back and do the hop\nMove till your body won't stop\nYou gotta do the hop, non-stop motion, non-stop\nYou gotta come back and do the, do the...\n\nYou see you, your career is done like Johnny Carson's\nGet me vexed, I do like Left Eye, start an arson\nNow that I got that out my system\nWatch me stab up the track as if my name was OJ Simpson\nI packs it in like Van Halen\nI work for mine, you, you're freeloading like Kato Kaelin\nI'm representing with my crew\nMess around, bite my rhymes, I'll beat that ass with my shoe\nC'mon, you know I'm crazy nice\nBrothers can't deal with the shorty named Phife\nYou must be mad in the head\nI bust his ass and leave 'im bloodclot for dead\nNiggas sound like Das EFX\nIf it ain't Das EFX then they sounding like Meth\nYou might as well do Megadeth\nY'all punk MCs better save your freaking breath\nYou's a corny motherfucker\nYou must be high smoking dust with Chris Tucker\nY'all faggot asses don't want this\nI pull more peeps than the peeps at the premier of Pocohantas\nWord is bond I am the baddest\nAnd all you honies out there, word is bond, you know my status\nSo come and pull your panties down\nThis ain't the Barnum Bailey show, I don't get down with the clowns\nSo why don't you and your friends get with me and my friends\nBut don't bring your ass by and you ain't got no ends\nWord is bond it don't stop\nJust ease your mind, come along and do the hop\n\nYou gotta do the hop, you move to the beat, you don't stop\nCome on everybody, do the hop\nEven if you cop, you gotta come back and do the hop\nYou move to the beat, you don't stop\nYou smoking jum rocks, you gotta just stop and do the hop\nThen you come back and do the hop\nYou know we don't stop, we on the ghetto prize on the top\nYou know we come back and do the hop\nShorties in the place, all the shorty rocks, do the hop\nYou gotta come back and do the hop\nWe never go on pop, you know we come back, we do the hop\nThis is how it is, we do the hop\nYou move to the beat, then come on everybody, don't..."}}, {"title": "The Infamous Date Rape", "album": "The Low End Theory",

rape)\n\nListen to the rhyme, it's a black ink fact\nPercentile rate of date rape is fat\nThis is all due to the reason of the skeezin\nYou got the right pickin but you're in the wrong season\nIf you're in the wrong season, that means you gotta break\nEspecially if a squaw tries to cry out rape\nYou be all vexed cause she got it goin on\nYou don't wanna fight cause you know that you're wrong\nSo instead you rest your head on the arm of the couch\nEnvision in your head of a great sex bout\nWorthy opponent, all you wanna do is bone it\nYou ask can you kick it, she says you can't stick it\nThis is the case, the situation is sticky\nShould you try to kiss or hint towards a hickey?\nNot even, you can ask Steven\nIf the vibe ain't right, huh, ya leavin\nHit the road Jack and all of that\nBut if she offers her abode, you'll drop ya load\nRight smack dab in the middle\nGet the kitten, I got crazy tender vittles\n\nUh-huh, you know the science, you get buckwild\nRunnin' mad games as if your name was Scott Skiles\nOr better yet Magic or even Karl Malone\nRegardless who it is, your aim is to bone\nIf she tries to front, that's when you start to diss her\nIf she's with the program, that's when you start to kiss her\nMight as well get to the point, no time to waste\nMight as well break the ice, then set the pace\nYou start to talk nasty, now she's ready to bone\nStep out of the shower, throw on cologne\nAll of a sudden, her sugarwalls tumble down like Jericho\nShe's hotter than Meshach, Shadrach and Abendego\nYou listen to After 7, break fool after 10\nDo your thing at 12 o'clock and when you go again\nThere goes round 1, ding, there goes round two\nNow tell me what the (fuck) are you supposed to do? Huh\nWhat do you know, when the meow is completed\nGirly girl cried rape, yo, I didn't really need it\n\nSweetheart, we ain't goin out like that\nSweetheart, we ain't goin out like that\nSweetheart, we ain't goin out like that (zulu)\nWe ain't goin out like that (zulu)\nWe ain't goin out like that\n\nNow baby bust it, if you wanna groove\nMe and you can do it, it will be the move\nI won't cry over spilled milk\nIf you won't let me take you to the Hilt\nI don't wanna bone you that much\nThat I would go for the unforbidden touch\nI'm not the type that would go for that\nI'll have to fetch a brand new cat\nBaby, baby, baby I don't wanna be rude\nBut I know because of your bloody attitude\nI know why you act that way\nIt usually happens on the 28th day\nI respect that crazily\nWhen you're done with the pads can you come check me?\nThis ain't a joint to disrespect you\nBecause one head ain't better than two\nCheck it out\n\nIt's a classic example of a (a date)", "image": "https://images.genius.com/a20a6e62f3cac5b33c6ac2c5a6ae57e1.1000x1000x1.png", "artist": "A Tribe Called Quest", "raw": {"annotation_count": 18, "api_path": "/songs/44657", "description": {"dom": {"tag": "root", "children": [{"tag": "p", "children": ["\u201cThe Infamous Date Rape\u201d is the eighth track on A Tribe Called Quest\u2019s sophomore album, ", {"tag": "em", "children": ["The Low End Theory"]}, ".

rape)\nClassic example of a (a date rape)\nClassic example of a (a date rape)\nClassic example of a (a date rape)\n\nListen to the rhyme, it's a black ink fact\nPercentile rate of date rape is fat\nThis is all due to the reason of the skeezin\nYou got the right pickin but you're in the wrong season\nIf you're in the wrong season, that means you gotta break\nEspecially if a squaw tries to cry out rape\nYou be all vexed cause she got it goin on\nYou don't wanna fight cause you know that you're wrong\nSo instead you rest your head on the arm of the couch\nEnvision in your head of a great sex bout\nWorthy opponent, all you wanna do is bone it\nYou ask can you kick it, she says you can't stick it\nThis is the case, the situation is sticky\nShould you try to kiss or hint towards a hickey?\nNot even, you can ask Steven\nIf the vibe ain't right, huh, ya leavin\nHit the road Jack and all of that\nBut if she offers her abode, you'll drop ya load\nRight smack dab in the middle\nGet the kitten, I got crazy tender vittles\n\nUh-huh, you know the science, you get buckwild\nRunnin' mad games as if your name was Scott Skiles\nOr better yet Magic or even Karl Malone\nRegardless who it is, your aim is to bone\nIf she tries to front, that's when you start to diss her\nIf she's with the program, that's when you start to kiss her\nMight as well get to the point, no time to waste\nMight as well break the ice, then set the pace\nYou start to talk nasty, now she's ready to bone\nStep out of the shower, throw on cologne\nAll of a sudden, her sugarwalls tumble down like Jericho\nShe's hotter than Meshach, Shadrach and Abendego\nYou listen to After 7, break fool after 10\nDo your thing at 12 o'clock and when you go again\nThere goes round 1, ding, there goes round two\nNow tell me what the (fuck) are you supposed to do? Huh\nWhat do you know, when the meow is completed\nGirly girl cried rape, yo, I didn't really need it\n\nSweetheart, we ain't goin out like that\nSweetheart, we ain't goin out like that\nSweetheart, we ain't goin out like that (zulu)\nWe ain't goin out like that (zulu)\nWe ain't goin out like that\n\nNow baby bust it, if you wanna groove\nMe and you can do it, it will be the move\nI won't cry over spilled milk\nIf you won't let me take you to the Hilt\nI don't wanna bone you that much\nThat I would go for the unforbidden touch\nI'm not the type that would go for that\nI'll have to fetch a brand new cat\nBaby, baby, baby I don't wanna be rude\nBut I know because of your bloody attitude\nI know why you act that way\nIt usually happens on the 28th day\nI respect that crazily\nWhen you're done with the pads can you come check me?\nThis ain't a joint to disrespect you\nBecause one head ain't better than two\nCheck it out\n\nIt's a classic example of a (a date)"}}, {"title": "The Killing Season", "album": "We got it from Here...

making my shit list\nSpring is in the air and all the flowers are blooming\nThe powers that be wanna devour the movement\nTears disappear when they fall on the summer rain\nBleedin' through this mic, but they call it entertainment\nRunning across stages is a drug\nIs like a blunt that we crumble in raw papers\nCall it the lord\u2019s name 'cause we taking it in our veins\nLike the feeding us intravenous\nIt\u2019s war and we fighting for inches and millimeters\nThey try to stall the progress by killing off all the leaders\nIf we don\u2019t give them martyrs no more, they can\u2019t defeat us\nThis lack of justice got us disgusted, look at our faces\nAll these soldiers hate but I saw military training\nThe false flags fly at a half mast this morning\nTake a bow, this might be your last performance\n\nThey sold ya, sold ya, sold ya\nThey sold ya, sold ya, sold ya\nThey sold ya, sold ya, sold ya\nThey sold ya, sold ya, sold ya\nThey sold ya, sold ya, sold ya\nThey sold ya, sold ya, sold ya\nThey sold ya, sold ya, sold ya\nThey sold ya, sold ya, sold ya\n\nThe old lady saw us on the lawn with the Henny\nTurn the pool party into the one from McKinney\nMight've been racist like the waitresses up in Denny\u2019s\nSwore we had twelve gauges, automatics, and semis\nNow they wanna condemn me for my freedom of speech\n'Cause I see things in black and white like Lisa and Screech\nPresidents get impeached and others fill in the throne\nBut veterans don\u2019t get the benefit of feelin' at home\nSo maybe those projections out at Silicon\nAre what drove her to get injections made of silicone\nI swear it\u2019s the killing season\n'Cause killin' is still in season, yeah\n\nLouder than a three pound, voices screaming mad to boot\nIt must be killing season, on the menu strangefruit\nWhose juices fill the progress of this here very nation\nWhose states has grown bitter through justice expiration\nThese fruitful trees are rooted in bloody soil and torment\nThings haven\u2019t really changed\nOr they're dormant for the moment\nMarks and scars, we own it, only makes for tougher skin\nHelps us actualize the actual greatness held within\nBeen on the wrong team so much, can\u2019t recognize a win\nSeems like my only crime is having melanin\nConnection to the sun so strong the relationship is lusted for\nCauses men to suffocate, I can\u2019t breathe no more\nSettle the score sadly, need an abacus to tally\nThrough all the peaks and valleys, yo, I recognize it sadly\nBlack soul bold enough, inner city cold enough\nWatch me get all my goons, watch us get soldiered up\n\nThey sold ya, sold ya, sold ya\nThey sold ya, sold ya, sold ya\nThey sold ya, sold ya, sold ya\nThey sold ya, sold ya, sold ya\nThey sold ya, sold ya, sold ya\nThey sold ya, sold ya, sold ya\nThey sold ya, sold ya, sold ya\nThey sold ya, sold ya, sold ya"}}, {"title": "The Love", "album": "The Love Movement", "year": "1998-09-29", "lyrics": "*all vocals by Q-Tip*\nSo many

all from the yolk\nOf one breed, one seed, to good goals we proceed\nNowadays I strive to be a very good influence\nEven though not too long ago I was a truant\nNow I'm droppin' it on this and many broad topics\nFrom man's obsession with money to holy prophets\nLike Mohammed, yo, you know the scene is so freaky\nEnemies they denounce me and my own try to sweep me\nNow I got hip-hop acts posin' like fat cats\nLex and a Rolex, Moet and a top hat\nBut what about your contract, slick? Is you proper?\nIt's time we turned the tables of this hip-hop fable\nI be strivin yo', tryna bang these joints out my skillet\nAnd fulfil it, think about these kids, we can't kill it\n\nNow every dog has his day, but eff that, it's my year\nAll you gat pullin' MC's could never come near\nAll that bogus type chatter, please put it to rest\nIt's the Phifer from Quest leavin' venues a mess\nSo I even start to (Rap) when you know you have no (Haps)\nWit' your simpleton (Lyrics), your light-hearted (Act)\nStep back, me no have no time for dat\nI'm blowin' up the spot for all you ras clot idi-ots\nIn a world where you have like a zillion MC's\nNinety percent of all you suckers have filthy LPs\nBitch this, trick that, come on, act like you know\nI be that up north MC who never chose to play the down-low\n(His name is Phife Dawg) I label myself as The Boss (True dat)\nSame height as Little Vicious, yet I'm shorter than Kriss Kross\nQueens representation, son, you know how we do\nWhile Light' and Sha, they represent BK to the fullest\nI be the sidekick to The Abstract, so get ready for combat\nYo, what about about them biters? Errr! Me not like that\nMy motto is to wreck shop, I do it on the non-stop\nCome on party people, you must give me my props\nCos y'all know good and damn well that the style has been mastered\nSo head for the border you peasy-haired bastards\nBefore I start to put it on ya, come on now, must I warn ya?\nQueens is in the house so all MC's go hold their corner\n\nWe feelin' pressures in here\nYou know we feelin' pressures\nFeelin' pressures in here\nYou know we feelin' pressures\nWe gotta stand clear\nJus' gotta stand clear\nGotta gotta stand clear of the pressure\nThe what?"}}, {"title": "The Remedy", "album": "The Lost Tribes", "year": "1996-10-16", "lyrics": "Yo, we all got different things that we got to deal with, you nam'sayin?

It's about relating back to the essence, you nam'sayin', where it all stems from. So I'mma do my thing over the drum like a Native Tongue, you know?

here, nigga\n(Move on to the stars)\nThere ain\u2019t a space program for niggas\nYeah, you stuck, stuck, stuck\n(Move on to the stars)\n\nSit and wonder sometimes, I read the paper every day\nAll these happenings is cycular, just happen different ways\nAnd the president's refined, in her wing she's confined\nWith about thirty Percocets and five bottles of wine\nCarolina nothing finer than a Black woman who climbs\nTo the top of the State building claiming that that flag is mine\nNow, people on top of people, feels like we can\u2019t breathe\nPut so much in this muthafucka, feel like we shouldn't leave\nPut it on TV, put it in movies, put it in our face\nThese notions and ideas and citizens live in space\nI chuckle just like all of y'all, absurdity, after all\nTakes money to get it running and money for trees to fall\nImagine for one second all the people are colored, please\nImagine for one second all the people in poverty\nNo matter the skin tone, culture or time zone\nThink the ones who got it\nWould even think to throw you a bone?\nMoved you out your neighbourhood, did they find you a home?\nNah cypher, probably no place to\nImagine if this shit was really talkin\u2019 about space, dude\nImagine if this shit was really talkin\u2019 about space, dude\nImagine if this shit was really talkin\u2019 about space, dude\n\nTime to go left and not right\nGotta get it together forever\nGotta get it together for brothers\nGotta get it together for sisters\nFor mothers and fathers and dead niggas\nFor non-conformers, won\u2019t hear the quitters\nFor Tyson types and Che figures\nLet\u2019s make somethin' happen, let\u2019s make somethin' happen\nLet\u2019s make somethin' happen, let\u2019s make somethin' happen\nGotta get it together for brothers\nGotta get it

it together for sisters\nFor mothers and fathers and dead niggas\nFor non-conformists, one hitter quitters\nFor Tyson types and Che figures\nLet\u2019s get it together, come on let\u2019s make it\nGotta make it to make it, to make it, to make it, to make it\nTo make something happen, to make something happen\nTo make something happen, let\u2019s make something happen\n\nWord to Phifer\nGonna bring it to the overlord, drinkin' Cisco\nChilling with the gold microphone cords\nAnd we grip our balls every time we stuntin' on tour\n'Cause we never bore, responding to the ready crowd's roar\nAnd promoters try to hit us with the art of war\nWe about our business, we not quitters\nNot bullshitters, we deliver\u2014we go-get it\nDon\u2019t be bitter 'cause we not just niggas\nJarobi, my fiber wove into different cloth\nAin\u2019t nothing forbidden, this nigga get his written off\nHardest spit in the city y\u2019all niggas spitting kitten soft\nConfused and amazed, shook up with your brain missing lost\nThey planning for our future, people\nNone of our people involved\nPouring Henny and Smirnoff to get it cracking off\nCracking off a Smirnoff to quickly turn to Molotov\nMolotov the spaceship doors before that bitch is taking off\nIt always seems the poorest persons\nAre people forsaken, dawg\nNo Washingtons, Jeffersons, Jacksons\nOn the captain's log\nThey\u2019d rather lead us to the grayest water poison deadly smog\nMass un-blackening, it\u2019s happening, you feel it y\u2019all?\nRather see we in a three-by-three structure with many bars\nLeave us where we are so they can play among the stars\nThey taking off to Mars, got the space vessels overflowing\nWhat, you think they want us there? All us niggas not going\nReputation ain\u2019t glowing, reparations ain\u2019t flowing\nIf you find yourself stuck in a creek, you better start rowing\nUsed to see the TV screen as the place to land my dream in\nAnd the car stereo where they would promote the show\nOptimistic little brother with a hope you know\n\n(Move on to the stars)\nThere ain\u2019t a space program for niggas\nYeah, you stuck here, nigga\n(Move on to the stars)\nThere ain\u2019t a space program for niggas\nYeah, you stuck here nigga\n(Move on to the stars)\nThere ain\u2019t a space program for niggas\nYeah, you stuck

these happenings is cycular, just happen different ways\nAnd the president's refined, in her wing she's confined\nWith about thirty Percocets and five bottles of wine\nCarolina nothing finer than a Black woman who climbs\nTo the top of the State building claiming that that flag is mine\nNow, people on top of people, feels like we can\u2019t breathe\nPut so much in this muthafucka, feel like we shouldn't leave\nPut it on TV, put it in movies, put it in our face\nThese notions and ideas and citizens live in space\nI chuckle just like all of y'all, absurdity, after all\nTakes money to get it running and money for trees to fall\nImagine for one second all the people are colored, please\nImagine for one second all the people in poverty\nNo matter the skin tone, culture or time zone\nThink the ones who got it\nWould even think to throw you a bone?\nMoved you out your neighbourhood, did they find you a home?\nNah cypher, probably no place to\nImagine if this shit was really talkin\u2019 about space, dude\nImagine if this shit was really talkin\u2019 about space, dude\nImagine if this shit was really talkin\u2019 about space, dude\n\nTime to go left and not right\nGotta get it

understand the oomph cause that's what I met her for\nI'm hooked on the swing, so just call me the music whore\nWomen love the voice, brothers dig the lyrics\nQuest the people's choice, we driving for the spirit\nIf you can't hear it, then get the wax utensil\nWrite my rhymes straight up, don't give it no fancy stencil\nThe rhymes be getting sweet, we stay away from tart\nA perfectionist at work, perking up the art\nIf you want to battle, I suggest you check your clock\nYour demise is coming up and I want your man to watch\nBe the prime example, or deeper still the sample\nInsignificance, here I'll place you on the mantle\nBorn up in Harlem, reside down in Jamaica\nThe girl I used to rock, her moms was a Quaker\nNow what does that make her? The evil money taker?\nThe crazy move faker, I use that to break her\n\nPhife is in the house (ooohh, you know you got going on)\nUncle Mike is in the house (this ain't a R&B song)\nBob Power is in the house (you got it going on)\nTim Latham is in the house (and on and on and on)\nWise Men is in the house\nThe Brand Nubes is in the house\nThe J Beez, they in the house\nAnd De La, they in the house\n\nI must regroup my thoughts and kick the next ones for my people\nPlease don't be deceived by the ugly slice of evil\nThe world is kinda cold and the rhythm is my blanket\nWrap yourself up in it, if you love it, then you'll thank it\nDon't move to rebuttal, wave your hand for action\nSome women in the 90's want more than satisfaction\nThey want keys and Gs, and all those illy things\nIf you want to, I'll show you, just what the Ab can bring\nI keep a tight net with my brothers Ken and Kenny\nIf the question is of rhymes, then I'll tell ya, I got plenty\nThe thing that men and women need to do is stick together\nProgressions can't be made if we're separate forever\nI hooked this funky beat with the loop and the feature\nThis the funky singing by Miss Vinia Mojica\nSo listen because the Quest is led through the underground\nMy people have been oppressed too long, no more will we be down\nPeople tend to riff cause they don't know the mental\nPeople tend to bug cause the beats are hard but gentle\nAfricano lurks through the body of this youngun'\nPlay like Bobby Byrd on your back and you're coming to\nThe house of the jazz, of the funk, of the rhythm\nAll the goods are welcome, but if you're a villain\nI'll just wait and debate, contemplate your arrival\nIf flexing is your motive, then you don't like survival\nThe Abstract is speaking, the hard beats is reaching\nTo Black and Puerto Ricans cause they're butt naked streaking\nThrough the ever murky streets of the urbanized areas\nBlasting out the speakers is the hip hop hysteria\n\nCraig is in the house (ooohh, you know you got going on)\nPete Rock is in the house (this ain't a R&B song)\nCL is in the house (you got it going on)\nUltramag is in the house (and on and on and on)\nNice and Smooth is in the house\nBig Daddy Kane is in the house\nBeatnuts is in the house\nSpecial Ed is in the house\n\nYeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah\nAnd this one goes out to my man\nThanks a lot Ron Carter on the bass\nYes my man Ron Carter is on the bass\nAnd check it out, going into the '91 decade\nUp in until the 2000 decade\nYou gotta say the Quest is on\nAnd goddamn it, yes the Quest is on\nAnd we out!", "image": "https://images.genius.com/a20a6e62f3cac5b33c6ac2c5a6ae57e1.1000x1000x1.png", "artist": "A Tribe Called Quest", "raw": {"annotation_count": 40, "api_path": "/songs/44653",

dream about my man last night\nAnd my man came by the studio\nAnd his name is...\n\nBusta Rhymes in effect\nShaheed is in effect\nPhife Did-awg is in effect\nCheck it out and give me my 'spect\n\nI'm moving, yes I'm grooving cause my mouth is on the motor\nUse the Coast in the morning to avoid the funky odor\nCan't help being funky, I'm the funky Abstract brother\nFunky in a sense, but I play the undercover\nOnce had a fetish, fetish for some booty\nNow I'm getting funky in my rap and that's my duty\nBrothers tend to jock on the style in particular\nIf you got the ego like some brothers then I'll get with ya\nBut if I don't pursue, then I just don't give a (fuck)\nMy motto in the 90's is be happy making bucks\nGirls love the jim, cos it causes crazy friction\nWhen it goes up in and fluctuates the diction\nI still understand the oomph cause that's what I met her for\nI'm hooked on the swing, so just call me the music whore\nWomen love the voice, brothers dig the lyrics\nQuest the people's choice, we driving for the spirit\nIf you can't hear it, then get the wax utensil\nWrite my rhymes straight up, don't give it no fancy stencil\nThe rhymes be getting sweet, we stay away from tart\nA perfectionist at work, perking up the art\nIf you want to battle, I suggest you check your clock\nYour demise is coming up and I want your man to watch\nBe the prime example, or deeper still the sample\nInsignificance, here I'll place you on the mantle\nBorn up in Harlem, reside down in Jamaica\nThe girl I used to rock, her moms was a Quaker\nNow what does that make her? The evil money taker?\nThe crazy move faker, I use that to break her\n\nPhife is in the house (ooohh, you know you got going on)\nUncle Mike is in the house (this ain't a R&B song)\nBob Power is in the house (you got it going on)\nTim Latham is in the house (and on and on and on)\nWise Men is in the house\nThe Brand Nubes is in the house\nThe J Beez, they in the house\nAnd De La, they in the house\n\nI must regroup my thoughts and kick the next ones for my people\nPlease don't be deceived by the ugly slice of evil\nThe world is kinda cold and the rhythm is my blanket\nWrap yourself up in it, if you love it, then you'll thank it\nDon't move to rebuttal, wave your hand for action\nSome women in the 90's want more than satisfaction\nThey want keys and Gs, and all those illy things\nIf you want to, I'll show you, just what the Ab can bring\nI keep a tight net with my brothers Ken and Kenny\nIf the question is of rhymes, then I'll tell ya, I got plenty\nThe thing that men and women need to do is stick together\nProgressions can't be made if we're separate forever\nI hooked this funky beat with the loop and the feature\nThis the funky singing by Miss Vinia Mojica\nSo listen because the Quest is led through the underground\nMy people have been oppressed too long, no more will we be down\nPeople tend to riff cause they don't know the mental\nPeople tend to bug cause the beats are hard but gentle\nAfricano lurks through the body of this youngun'\nPlay like Bobby Byrd on your back and you're coming to\nThe house of the jazz, of the funk, of the rhythm\nAll the goods are welcome, but if you're a villain\nI'll just wait and debate, contemplate your arrival\nIf flexing is your motive, then you don't like survival\nThe Abstract is speaking, the hard beats is reaching\nTo Black and Puerto Ricans cause they're butt naked streaking\nThrough the ever murky streets of the urbanized areas\nBlasting out the speakers is the hip hop hysteria\n\nCraig is in the house (ooohh, you know you got going on)\nPete Rock is in the house (this ain't a R&B song)\nCL is in the house (you got it going on)\nUltramag is in the house (and on and on and on)\nNice and Smooth is in the house\nBig Daddy Kane is in the house\nBeatnuts is in the house\nSpecial Ed is in the house\n\nYeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah\nAnd this one goes out to my man\nThanks a lot Ron Carter on the bass\nYes my man Ron Carter is on the bass\nAnd check it out, going into the '91 decade\nUp in until the 2000 decade\nYou gotta say the Quest is on\nAnd goddamn it, yes the Quest is on\nAnd we out!"}}, {"title": "Vibes and Stuff", "album": "The Low End Theory", "year": "1991-09-24", "lyrics": "Let me flaunt the style, I think that the time's near\nThat we drop Scuds, there won't be no duds here\nRappers play the dumb, kinda on the space tip\nBut when they hear the jams, they be on the dilsnick\nNow I'm not for the rock, I know the territory\nGo ahead and try, that's a different story\nSimilar to Grimm, I could tell a better one\nAll about a kid, who couldn't rap and didn't run\nStands on the side when the mic is getting dumb\nResorts to bagging Billy, asking could he have some\nNo never ever, go back and try again man\nIf you come back, I'll be the first to shake your hand\nCompetition's good, it brings out the vital parts\nThe Abstract Poetic, majors in recital arts\nDo it for the kids, the elders and the rap peers\nWe know the job is done when we hear a lot of cheers\nGotta feel the vibes, real from my creation\nIf the hands clap I'm filled with elation\nHere I am ghetto, full with a lot of steam\nThink I gotta, I think I gotta, I think I gotta scream\nCause that's how good it feels child\nLet your hair down, so we can get buckwild\nDo your ill dance, don't think about the next man\nWe must have unity and think of the bigger plan\nDivision we will fall, we must stick together, see\nI'd like to take this time to say what's up to Kool G\nThe name is Q-Tip, the Midnight Marauder\nGiving nuff respects to Afrika Bambaataa\nAs a man in the world, I must do my job\nTake care of Mama Duke, I won't resort to rob\nBob you'll get your dough, Mase is my witness\nObsessed with the rap, for it's the mental fitness\nLike shooting Cee-lo, and always hitting head cracks\nThe industry is luck, winning with the fake raps\nPeace to the crews who pump the real hip hop\nNot selling out, from hardrock to disc jock\n\nI don't know what to say, but here I go freak it\nIf the papes come, then you know I'll seek it\nI'm just a short brother, dark skin face\nWeigh a buck-fifty, 36 waist\nHair is crazy curly, flip like Mr. Furley\nTo this day I still believe that no MC can serve me\nBrothers try to front, but everybody know\nI get more props than the Arsenio Hall Show\nParty animal I was, but now I chill at home\nAll I do is write rhymes, eat, drink, shit and bone\nFound my thrill in Amityville, I'm always in the Island\nFudge and Lucky know the time, they know who keeps 'em smiling\nGo out on my own, something that I gotta do\nDo what the hell I want and have no one to listen to\nI'm prompt with my business and I do things on the double\nYo, I'm out like Buster Douglas, I say peace to MC Trouble\nRest in peace\n\nWord Up, rest in Peace, and you know what else?\nWe got, we got, we got the vibes\nAll the people in Long Island, we got the vibes\nBrooklyn and Queens, we got the vibes\nUptown and Now Rule, we got the vibes\nPeople Upstate, we got the vibes\nIf you're in DC, you got the vibes\nMaryland, Virginia, Carolina vibes\nOut West, we got the vibes\nIn the Bahamas, we got the vibes\nOver in Europe, you know what, we got the vibes\nAnd we gotta keep it alive, it goes um...\n\nOf rap I'm a fan, I've seen a whole lot of slums\nGood with the girls, I get a whole lot of 'em\nFrom fat to skinny, Freda to Winnie\nEmma to Cindy, Constance to Wendy\nCause I be real friendly, never on the snotty side\nI don't brag to brothers about the little papes I got\nMy vocal styles can vary, the sight is never scary\nIt's only legendary, my father well prepared me\nMy job ain't temporary, I'm here for the long shot\nBetter yet the long term, I don't have a perm\nIn a way I do, call 'em the perma-naps\nI'm crazy slap-happy and I'm scrappy and I'm nappy\nWhen I get the mic in my hand with the crowd in the stands\nIt's as good as grand like that\n\nYo, I wanna say peace and dedicate this joint to MC Trouble\nAnd to uh... Trouble T Roy\nAnd to um... Scott La Rock\nAnd to um... Cowboy, you know what I'm sayin?\nThis is for the slain rappers and the fallen rappers, you know what I'm saying?\nThis is a special, special, special, special, special dedication\nAnd also to my Pops and also to Vinia's Moms, you know what I'm saying?\nYou just gotta keep it happy and keep the vibes going\nCause this is vibes and stuff, and we out...", "image":

there won't be no duds here\nRappers play the dumb, kinda on the space tip\nBut when they hear the jams, they be on the dilsnick\nNow I'm not for the rock, I know the territory\nGo ahead and try, that's a different story\nSimilar to Grimm, I could tell a better one\nAll about a kid, who couldn't rap and didn't run\nStands on the side when the mic is getting dumb\nResorts to bagging Billy, asking could he have some\nNo never ever, go back and try again man\nIf you come back, I'll be the first to shake your hand\nCompetition's good, it brings out the vital parts\nThe Abstract Poetic, majors in recital arts\nDo it for the kids, the elders and the rap peers\nWe know the job is done when we hear a lot of cheers\nGotta feel the vibes, real from my creation\nIf the hands clap I'm filled with elation\nHere I am ghetto, full with a lot of steam\nThink I gotta, I think I gotta, I think I gotta scream\nCause that's how good it feels child\nLet your hair down, so we can get buckwild\nDo your ill dance, don't think about the next man\nWe must have unity and think of the bigger plan\nDivision we will fall, we must stick together, see\nI'd like to take this time to say what's up to Kool G\nThe name is Q-Tip, the Midnight Marauder\nGiving nuff respects to Afrika Bambaataa\nAs a man in the world, I must do my job\nTake care of Mama Duke, I won't resort to rob\nBob you'll get your dough, Mase is my witness\nObsessed with the rap, for it's the mental fitness\nLike shooting Cee-lo, and always hitting head cracks\nThe industry is luck, winning with the fake raps\nPeace to the crews who pump the real hip hop\nNot selling out, from hardrock to disc jock\n\nI don't know what to say, but here I go freak it\nIf the papes come, then you know I'll seek it\nI'm just a short brother, dark skin face\nWeigh a buck-fifty, 36 waist\nHair is crazy curly, flip like Mr. Furley\nTo this day I still believe that no MC can serve me\nBrothers try to front, but everybody know\nI get more props than the Arsenio Hall Show\nParty animal I was, but now I chill at home\nAll I do is write rhymes, eat, drink, shit and bone\nFound my thrill in Amityville, I'm always in the Island\nFudge and Lucky know the time, they know who keeps 'em smiling\nGo out on my own, something that I gotta do\nDo what the hell I want and have no one to listen to\nI'm prompt with my business and I do things on the double\nYo, I'm out like Buster Douglas, I say peace to MC Trouble\nRest in peace\n\nWord Up, rest in Peace, and you know what else?\nWe got, we got, we got the vibes\nAll the people in Long Island, we got the vibes\nBrooklyn and Queens, we got the vibes\nUptown and Now Rule, we got the vibes\nPeople Upstate, we got the vibes\nIf you're in DC, you got the vibes\nMaryland, Virginia, Carolina vibes\nOut West, we got the vibes\nIn the Bahamas, we got the vibes\nOver in Europe, you know what, we got the vibes\nAnd we gotta keep it alive, it goes um...\n\nOf rap I'm a fan, I've seen a whole lot of slums\nGood with the girls, I get a whole lot of 'em\nFrom fat to skinny, Freda to Winnie\nEmma to Cindy, Constance to Wendy\nCause I be real friendly, never on the snotty side\nI don't brag to brothers about the little papes I got\nMy vocal styles can vary, the sight is never scary\nIt's only legendary, my father well prepared me\nMy job ain't temporary, I'm here for the long shot\nBetter yet the long term, I don't have a perm\nIn a way I do, call 'em the perma-naps\nI'm crazy slap-happy and I'm scrappy and I'm nappy\nWhen I get the mic in my hand with the crowd in the stands\nIt's as good as grand like that\n\nYo, I wanna say peace and dedicate this joint to MC Trouble\nAnd to uh... Trouble T Roy\nAnd to um... Scott La Rock\nAnd to um... Cowboy, you know what I'm sayin?\nThis is for the slain rappers and the fallen rappers, you know what I'm saying?\nThis is a special, special, special, special, special dedication\nAnd also to my Pops and also to Vinia's Moms, you know what I'm saying?\nYou just gotta keep it happy and keep the vibes going\nCause this is vibes and stuff, and we out..."}}, {"title": "We Can Get Down", "album": "Midnight Marauders", "year": "1993-11-09", "lyrics": "We can get down, we can we can get down (Repeat x8)\nIt's like that man, it's like that (yes!)

mood\nWhen we get hungry we eat the same fucking food\nThe ramen noodle\nYour simple voodoo is so maniacal, we're liable to pull a juju\nThe irony is that this bad bitch in my lap\nShe don't love me, she make money, she don't study that\nShe gon' give it to me, ain't gon' tell me run it back\nShe gon' take the brain to wetter plains, she spit on that\nThe doors have signs with, don't try to rhyme with\nVH1 has a show that you can waste your time with\nGuilty pleasures take the edge off reality\nAnd for a salary I'd probably do that shit sporadically\nThe OG Gucci boots are smitten with iguanas\nThe IRS piranha see a nigga gettin' commas\nNiggas in the hood living in a fishbowl\nGentrify here, now it's not a shit hole\nTrendsetter, I know, my shit's cold\nAin't settling because I ain't so bold but ay\n\nAll you Black folks, you must go\nAll you Mexicans, you must go\nAnd all you poor folks, you must go\nMuslims and gays, boy, we hate your ways\nSo all you bad folks, you must go\n\nThe fog and the smog of news media that logs\nFalse narratives of Gods that came up against the odds\nWe're not just nigga rappers with the bars\nIt's kismet that we're cosmic with the stars\n\nYou bastards overlooking street art\nBetter yet, street smarts but you keep us off the charts\nSo motherfuck your numbers and your statisticians\nFuck y'all know about true competition?\nThat's like a AL pitcher on deck talking about he hittin'\nThe only one who's hitting are the ones that's currently spittin'\nWe got your missy smitten rubbing on her little kitten\nDreaming of a world that's equal for women with no division\nBoy, I tell you that's vision\nLike Tony Romo when he hitting Witten\nThe Tribe be the best in they division\nShaheed Muhammad cut it with precision\nWho can come back years later, still hit the shot?\nStill them tryna move we off the fucking block\nBabylon, bloodclaat\nTwo pon yuh headtop\n\nAll you Black folks, you must go\nAll

juju\nThe irony is that this bad bitch in my lap\nShe don't love me, she make money, she don't study that\nShe gon' give it to me, ain't gon' tell me run it back\nShe gon' take the brain to wetter plains, she spit on that\nThe doors have signs with, don't try to rhyme with\nVH1 has a show that you can waste your time with\nGuilty pleasures take the edge off reality\nAnd for a salary I'd probably do that shit sporadically\nThe OG Gucci boots are smitten with iguanas\nThe IRS piranha see a nigga gettin' commas\nNiggas in the hood living in a fishbowl\nGentrify here, now it's not a shit hole\nTrendsetter, I know, my shit's cold\nAin't settling because I ain't so bold but ay\n\nAll you Black folks, you must go\nAll you Mexicans, you must go\nAnd all you poor folks, you must go\nMuslims and gays, boy, we hate your ways\nSo all you bad folks, you must go\n\nThe fog and the smog of news media that logs\nFalse narratives of Gods that came up against the odds\nWe're not just nigga rappers with the bars\nIt's kismet that we're cosmic with the stars\n\nYou bastards overlooking street art\nBetter yet, street smarts but you keep us off the charts\nSo motherfuck your numbers and your statisticians\nFuck y'all know about true competition?\nThat's like a AL pitcher on deck talking about he hittin'\nThe only one who's hitting are the ones that's currently spittin'\nWe got your missy smitten rubbing on her little kitten\nDreaming of a world that's equal for women with no division\nBoy, I tell you that's vision\nLike Tony Romo when he hitting Witten\nThe Tribe be the best in they division\nShaheed Muhammad cut it with precision\nWho can come back years later, still hit the shot?\nStill them tryna move we off the fucking block\nBabylon, bloodclaat\nTwo pon yuh headtop\n\nAll you Black folks, you must go\nAll you Mexicans, you must go\nAnd all you poor folks, you must go\nMuslims and gays, boy, we hate your ways\nSo all you bad folks, you must go"}},

twelve, never ever goin for self\nTribe Called Quest situation\nCheck it out\nQ-Tip:\nPower. People really get caught with this on different levels\nPower controls your life\nMoney: The companion of the first. Some people tend to worship\nAnd we know this ain't right\nPhife:\nAttitude (attitude) is how I get my point across\nYou can't call yourself an MC if you know that you're soft\nAggressive...is how the stage is approached.

When the mind accept facts\nOn this plane of livin, knowledge be the key, black\nUnderstanding. Gettin a grip on what's revealed\nWhen shit be real, can't give understanding back\nPhife:\nAnalyze. That's what I do to MCs\nThat be talkin bout they this and that, money please\nEgo. I'm on my own jock skill\nCuz if I don't say I'm the best, tell me who the hell will\nConsequence:\nCheeba smoke y'all. That's what I use to get high\nWhen I'm in a rut and I don't know why\nTry.
