the scene changes with beats\nAnd now you ask yourself, how you want to be seen\nThere must be 50 ways to make a record\nHe's up inside the clubs, they like to lean and rock, oh\nStands around and looks intrigued by what he saw, now he asks me\nHow he can make hit songs to reach the top\nThere must be 50 ways to make a record\n50 ways to make a record\n\nYou got talent and your soul cannot be bought\nHe looked and smiled at me and told me \"Thanks a lot.\"\nSee I could use your help\nAnd would you please explain about the 50 ways\nIt's kind of easy if you have a open mind\nThis game is more than spending money and fucking dimes\nIt's all within your words, some shit that outlives time\nThere must be 50 ways to make a record\n50 ways to make a record"}}, {"title": "Adventures",

moon shines\nI become alive\nYeah\n\nI'm feeling strange in the night\nI'm not myself, I feel I'm thrown into a fight\nAh\nNowhere to run, nowhere to hide, nothing's right\nMy skin is burning and my heart begins to speed\nThere's something going wrong with me\nI am changing rapidly\nAy\nI'm feeling stronger, more alert, I'm on the move\nMm\nI smell her scent, and I know I will find her soon, soon, soon\nThe one to come and free me from this fate\nI'll find her, it's not too late\nHey-hey\n\nEvery time\nThe moon shines\nI become alive\nYeah\nAnd every time\nThe moon shines\nI become alive\nYeah\n\nI'm a beast in the night\nI'm on the prowl while I'm hoping to find some light\nYou call it Heaven, I do too, we feel the same\nAin't nothing wrong, I'll be feasting on something brave\nAy\nA sexy lady who's pure, she has the cure\nAh\nI hope she can find the man within the beast\nAnd\nI hope she saves me from the curse I have to beat\nHey\nI hope she figures out a way to save my soul\nYeah, to save my heart\nHey\n\nEvery time\nThe moon shines\nI become alive\nYeah\nAnd every time\nThe moon shines\nI become alive\nYeah\n\nNananananananana-na\nWhoa, nananananana-na\nNananananananana-na\nWhoa, nananananana-na\n\nI watch the sun collapse\nAnd took up in the clizzoud\nI am the lone wolf, go where I wanna\nLet the moon shine, be the guide to the lizzight\nEven when I stray away the light never left me\nUh\nI learn to follow my instinct\nBlinded by the light, rather that than the evil\nFeelin' out of place in a room full of people\nTry and be the same, but you know you're not a sequel\nYour fate will be whatever it shall be, be, be, be, be\nWon't fight no more, I let these things just be, be, be, be\n\nEvery time\nThe moon shines\nI become alive\nYeah\nAnd every time\nThe moon shines\nI become alive\nYeah\n\nNananananananana-na\nWhoooa, nananananana-na\nNananananananana-na\nWhoooa, nananananana-na"}}, {"title": "All Along", "album":

"2016-12-01", "lyrics": "Easy, back up, back up, back up\nTurn your radio, turn your radio, off\nWatch me now, baby, baby\nUh uh, uh uh\n\nBitches in my ear, they saying they love me\nYou don't love Scott, you love the Kid Cudi\nI ain't no fucking slouch, show you what I'm 'bout\nMy energy is a bit too precious, too drenched in them blessings\nTransitioning to my inner, I'm hearing their voice\nTell me stay in focus, keep focusing, boy\nFeeling like a trilli billi\nThe man everywhere I go, in any city\nI mean, damn the girls, girls, girls galore\nI mean, damn the girls, girls, girls adore\nMixing fluorescent to the core of the accouterment\nOff the tippy titty, setting off my groupie radar\nSipping Hen', dapping hands off the roof of my Porsche\nA fresh nigga at large, a fresh nigga go hard\nAll my youngins say \"keep it going\"\nAll my youngins, they dumb and repping, they always knowing\n\nGot some pride in your town, I'm spotting 'em lately\nThree-piece suit and I'm looking so cute\nSexy mama, send her way, you doing it honey\nThem hating fucks sideline and question what you do\nNot this, my nigga, you be here (be here)\nNot this, my nigga, you ain't here (ain't here)\nBig boss, I made your heart heavy\nCan't stop me, can't carry me, baby\n\nLife ain't easy sober, we live so geeky\nDid just what you taught us, kept peace, no drama\nPhoned home to the moon, did you change your number?\nIf and when you get this message, need you back home\nBig bro, big bro, big bro, big bro - back home\nBig bro, we need you, come home - back home\nBig bro, big bro, shit's fucked, come home\nHigh-igh-igher, high-igh, high-igh-igher\nHigh-igh-igher, high-igh, high-igh-igher\nHigh-igh-igher, high-igh, high-igh-igher\nHigh-igh-igher, high-igh, high-igh-igher\n\nNightmares kept a nigga from closing his lids\nSince a kid, I've been haunted by visions of death\nSuch a trip, now it's normal, I customed the grip\nThink they gone, nah, they just dormant the haunted ain't left\nNow tell me what's a young nigga to do\nWhen the zombies are coming for you?\nLoad up them Daryl Dixons\nSurvived the rage, turn the page, relaxing, I'm whippin'\nLast week I almost weaved right off of Mulholland\nChiefing good like I should, alone in my thoughts\nAll the awesome places I've gone to and witnessed\nIs it worth the paranoia, betrayal, or loss?\nNah nah, heroes can't simply have it all\nSacrifice, but see heroes don't sleep, we hear the call\nMy nieces know Uncle Scottie is so rock 'n' roll\nMy princess Vada know rock 'n' roll daddy got the glow\n\nGot some pride in your town, I'm spotting 'em lately\nThree-piece suit and I'm looking so cute\nSexy mama, send her way, you doing it honey\nThem hating fucks sidelining and question what you do\nNot this, my nigga, you be here\nNot this, my nigga, you ain't here\nBig boss, I made your heart heavy\nCan't stop me, can't carry me, baby\n\nLife ain't easy sober, we live so geeky\nDid just what you taught us, kept peace, no drama\nPhoned home to the moon, did you change your number?\nIf and when you get this message, need you back home\nBig bro, big bro, big bro, big bro - back home\nBig bro, we need you, come home - back home\nBig bro, big bro, shit's fucked, come home\nHigh-igh-igher, high-igh, high-igh-igher\nHigh-igh-igher, high-igh, high-igh-igher\nHigh-igh-igher, high-igh, high-igh-igher\nHigh-igh-igher,

you love the Kid Cudi\nI ain't no fucking slouch, show you what I'm 'bout\nMy energy is a bit too precious, too drenched in them blessings\nTransitioning to my inner, I'm hearing their voice\nTell me stay in focus, keep focusing, boy\nFeeling like a trilli billi\nThe man everywhere I go, in any city\nI mean, damn the girls, girls, girls galore\nI mean, damn the girls, girls, girls adore\nMixing fluorescent to the core of the accouterment\nOff the tippy titty, setting off my groupie radar\nSipping Hen', dapping hands off the roof of my Porsche\nA fresh nigga at large, a fresh nigga go hard\nAll my youngins say \"keep it going\"\nAll my youngins, they dumb and repping, they always knowing\n\nGot some pride in your town, I'm spotting 'em lately\nThree-piece suit and I'm looking so cute\nSexy mama, send her way, you doing it honey\nThem hating fucks sideline and question what you do\nNot this, my nigga, you be here (be here)\nNot this, my nigga, you ain't here (ain't here)\nBig boss, I made your heart heavy\nCan't stop me, can't carry me, baby\n\nLife ain't easy sober, we live so geeky\nDid just what you taught us, kept peace, no drama\nPhoned home to the moon, did you change your number?\nIf and when you get this message, need you back home\nBig bro, big bro, big bro, big bro - back home\nBig bro, we need you, come home - back home\nBig bro, big bro, shit's fucked, come home\nHigh-igh-igher, high-igh, high-igh-igher\nHigh-igh-igher, high-igh, high-igh-igher\nHigh-igh-igher, high-igh, high-igh-igher\nHigh-igh-igher, high-igh, high-igh-igher\n\nNightmares kept a nigga from closing his lids\nSince a kid, I've been haunted by visions of death\nSuch a trip, now it's normal, I customed the grip\nThink they gone, nah, they just dormant the haunted ain't left\nNow tell me what's a young nigga to do\nWhen the zombies are coming for you?\nLoad up them Daryl Dixons\nSurvived the rage, turn the page, relaxing, I'm whippin'\nLast week I almost weaved right off of Mulholland\nChiefing good like I should, alone in my thoughts\nAll the awesome places I've gone to and witnessed\nIs it worth the paranoia, betrayal, or loss?\nNah nah, heroes can't simply have it all\nSacrifice, but see heroes don't sleep, we hear the call\nMy nieces know Uncle Scottie is so rock 'n' roll\nMy princess Vada know rock 'n' roll daddy got the glow\n\nGot some pride in your town, I'm spotting 'em lately\nThree-piece suit and I'm looking so cute\nSexy mama, send her way, you doing it honey\nThem hating fucks sidelining and question what you do\nNot this, my nigga, you be here\nNot this, my nigga, you ain't here\nBig boss, I made your heart heavy\nCan't stop me, can't carry me, baby\n\nLife ain't easy sober, we live so geeky\nDid just what you taught us, kept peace, no drama\nPhoned home to the moon, did you change your number?\nIf and when you get this message, need you back home\nBig bro, big bro, big bro, big bro - back home\nBig bro, we need you, come home -

your network\nWhile the Tec squirt, jerk, there's holes inside your sweatshirt\nThrough your apparel, through your blood, through your bone marrow\nPrecise with this mic device, slice your pie like Sbarros\nYou falling nigga, and you can't get up\nYou been stalling motherfucker now your ass is stuck\nBrooklyn, Brownsville, baby, stay with the Killer Hill crazy\nAnkle strap above the boot, it conceals my three eighty\nAre you running for this money money? Hunting eggs like Easter Bunny\nGeeks trying to beast upon me, freak, I will eat a zombie\nCalm and double while you jumping through these hurdles\nSilly rabbit, the race is always won by the turtle\nMental machinery, purple herbal mixed with that greenery\nI don\u2019t write songs, grasshopper, I write sceneries\nEverything ain\u2019t what it seems to be\nWhat it means to you, it don\u2019t mean to me\nBzzz, a sting from the killer bees\n\nIn God I trust, now I don't give no fucks\n(Dropping them-them-them, motherfucking Beez)\nIn God I trust, now I don't give no

vicious, exotic nympho whore for the mistress\nLife is good, I live every day like it's Christmas\nHappy New Year, I does what the fuck I wanna do here\nI splash that Gucci shit from the shirt to the shoewear\nTrust the rings out, wife beater tee with the wings out\nLong dick stamina, I fuck a bird 'til she sings out\nLa la la la, Bobby could convert Lady Gaga\nBack to heterosexual, I'm classy like Impala\nPlus I'm federal, when it comes to making dollas\nLike Jigga nigga man, if you hear me then holla\nGold rings like the Green Lantern, you see me in the mean phantom\nPushing over there in Ohio, outside of Canton\nOr maybe in the grotty, rugged projects of Staten\nTall redbone in my shower, she looking like Paula Patton\n\nIn God I trust, now I don't give no fucks\n(Dropping

is marvelous\nYou Krusty Krab squad, y'all will rust, y'all ain't hard enough\nDemolition expert, I exert through your network\nWhile the Tec squirt, jerk, there's holes inside your sweatshirt\nThrough your apparel, through your blood, through your bone marrow\nPrecise with this mic device, slice your pie like Sbarros\nYou falling nigga, and you can't get up\nYou been stalling motherfucker now your ass is stuck\nBrooklyn, Brownsville, baby, stay with the Killer Hill crazy\nAnkle strap above the boot, it conceals my three eighty\nAre you running for this money money? Hunting eggs like Easter Bunny\nGeeks trying to beast upon me, freak, I will eat a zombie\nCalm and double while you jumping through these hurdles\nSilly rabbit, the race is always won by the turtle\nMental machinery, purple herbal mixed with that greenery\nI don\u2019t write songs, grasshopper, I write sceneries\nEverything ain\u2019t what it seems to be\nWhat it means to you, it don\u2019t mean to me\nBzzz, a sting from the killer bees\n\nIn God I trust, now I don't give no fucks\n(Dropping them-them-them, motherfucking Beez)\nIn God I trust, now I don't give no

them-them-them, motherfucking Beez on 'em)\nStings bitch, bzzzz...\nBzzzzZZZzzz\n\nI pass any test of litmus, I workout at 24 Fitness\nOn the weekends I sip Belvedere with that citrus\nMy dogs is vicious, exotic nympho whore for the mistress\nLife is good, I live every day like it's Christmas\nHappy New Year, I does what the fuck I wanna do here\nI splash that Gucci shit from the shirt to the shoewear\nTrust the rings out, wife beater tee with the wings out\nLong dick stamina, I fuck a bird 'til she sings out\nLa la la la, Bobby could convert Lady Gaga\nBack to heterosexual, I'm classy like Impala\nPlus I'm federal, when it comes to making dollas\nLike Jigga nigga man, if you hear me then holla\nGold rings like the Green Lantern, you see me in the mean phantom\nPushing over there in Ohio, outside of Canton\nOr maybe in the grotty, rugged projects of Staten\nTall redbone in my shower, she looking like Paula Patton\n\nIn God I trust, now I don't give no fucks\n(Dropping them-them-them, motherfucking Beez)\nIn God I trust, now I don't give no fucks\n(Dropping them-them-them, motherfucking Beez)\nIn God I trust, now I don't give no fucks\n(Dropping them-them-them,

nigga\nIf y'all fell out over a chick that ain't your real nigga\nBefore I be a house nigga be a field nigga\nI gotta Port Arthur chick, call it my trill nigga\nI met Duke in '92 and we still niggas\nRockin Hilfigers before they was like chill niggas\nLiving well me and my niggas gon' eat\nBefore you hate, hit the brakes with both feet\n\nHey yo, all right\nThis is how it's 'posed to

chains with another chain\nUpgraded to a better chain, that Beretta sing, I ain't playing\nShoes on the 'rari start to look like hooves\nPigs by the crib start to look like wolves\nMoney neva change me only change the situation\nThe paper I be chasin' got them sucka niggas hatin'\nStarted from the pavement, basement Satan\nCouldn't match my flames so they compare me to a mason\nFree like slaves but they based and crazy\nWe talkin' 'bout crack or we talkin' about blacks?\nSpliffing the blunt up, then they pickin' the gun up\nMotherfuckers is trippin', they fittin' to run up\nThen they gettin'

gave me in\nWhen I eternally have faith\nIn the choices you made, it's all by design\nGo with it, mmmm\nCome on, don't fuck up the feng shui\nFeng shui, feng shui, feng shui, feng shui\n\nI see everything with new beams, I do dream\nMy eyes are glowing mood rings, you're boring\nStop dueling with the true thing, I do think\nWhen you think too much you're removing what's moving\nStuck inside a statue, look at you\nGo ahead and pogo, something gon' catch you\nA petty logo, shed all my tattoos\nI read all the bad news that says I'm too careful\n\nOooh, tap in to the frequency, love\nOooh, tap in to the frequency, love\n\nThe universe never steered me wrong\nThe universe never lied\nTake me bound to the come me down\nThe fantasy in this remedy\nFree from where you don't belong in the concept of time\nNew levels, mmm, come on\n\nMoments don't pass me up, no, no\n'Cause I seize them in stride\nTell them winnin' never gave me in\nWhen I eternally have faith\nIn the choices you made, it's all by design\nGo with it, mmmm\nCome on, don't fuck up the feng shui\n\nSo twisted in emotional notions, oh yeah\nI savor your love, don't fuck up the feng shui\n\nI see every thing with new beams, I do dream\nMy eyes are glowing mood rings, you're boring\nStop dueling with the true thing, I do think\nWhen you think too much you're removing what's moving\nStuck inside a statue, look at

frequency, love\n\nFeel I'm being tested every minute\nFeel like yesterday I was blind, I've been lost\nSeems like I've stumbled on a path, no coincidence\nTruly in my essence, I've arrived\nWho am I? Who am I? Don't remind me\nToo alive, too alive, new arriving\nYou were right, I was left in it before\nTo the light, to the light, I am Carol Anne\nParallel to paradise\nI reach out for my lifeline\nThe angels laugh in paradise\nThey say I am my own lifeline, look in you\nTo the night, to the night I'm abandoned\nTo deny, to deny, what a sandpit\nCouldn't I, couldn't I have an angel?\nTo the light, to the light, I am Carol Anne\n\nSo twisted in emotional notions, oh yeah\nI savor your love, don't fuck up the feng shui\n\nI see every thing with new beams, I do dream\nMy eyes are glowing mood rings, you're boring\nStop dueling with the true thing, I do think\nWhen you think too much you're removing what's moving\nStuck inside a statue, look at you\nGo ahead and pogo, something gon' catch you\nA

stupid, your choice of technique is foolish\nBattle be strong the new kid\nDon\u2019t matter my scars were leaking\nI\u2019ll be standing still demanding, I\u2019ll be winner\nRapid punches delivered\nYour soul is feeling weaker by the moment\nI stood before opponents all my energy I\u2019m holding\nVictory to me you see those other main components\nPow Pow Pow I knock em down\nI am flawless in every round\n\nI'm ready to fight now, fire to fire\nHit for hit now, blow for blow\nThe road is vicious but I\u2019ll be victorious\nScar for scar, the way a nigga would flow\nI'm ready to fight now, fire to fire\nHit for hit now, blow for blow\n\nNo, no, no, I won't get bodied\nMy heart is powered with power from cowards\nI may be tired from steppin up to a champion\nHit them up and break them down\nI\u2019m aiming to break some bones\nI\u2019m focused and overdosed on adrenaline\nAnd I strengthen them with confidence\nEvery hit and every kick is rapid fire\nAnd my thoughts is sour if I feel there is no lighter\nHere, summon every single bit of courage\nIn my lion heart\nThey start it then I finish it\nWe\u2019ll finish it\n\nI'm ready to fight now, fire to fire\nHit for hit now, blow for blow\nThe road is vicious but I\u2019ll be victorious\nScar for scar, the way a nigga would flow\nI'm ready to fight now, fire to fire\nHit for hit now, blow for blow\nI'm ready to fight now, fire to fire\nHit for hit now, blow for blow\nThe road is vicious but I\u2019ll be victorious\nScar for scar, the way a nigga would flow\nI'm ready to fight now, fire to fire\nHit for hit

fronting, saying something\nUntil I, open my mothafuckin' mind and let it spill\nOver samples over sense over heavy kicks in the mix\nFigured I was all singing til I began ripping\nReady to die ever

wondered if I get this rappin' right\nHmm, I know why the bitches treat me oh so, politely\nI need the mushu and this occurs to\nI'll explain more after a blunt or two\nHey\n\nOh, will they come

Christ\nSo until I get my world right homie I'm Jesus chainless\nWaiting in the dungeon with the not many stainless\nI'll be buckin at my demons\nTruly for more reasons I couldn't put into words\nOnly assign melodies\nIf you ever hear a sweet sad sound\nThose are the profound tones of\nWhile I'm feeling lost, still waiting to found, down\nNot by a model bitch, in her peace and Carey Anne\nNew motivation for the new generation\nBorn in 96' watching reruns of Fresh Prince\nInspiration come from all different angles\nIt is tangled in between\nThe bullshit that can claim you\nAye LeBron play this song before\nYou step on the court\nThis could your alley-oop\nWhile you hop out the coupe\nNever made it on the team\nBut I'm pimpin for sport\nIgnorant to the fact I'm dying quick off this port\nIf any niggas set the goal for the sky to be the limit\nYou limit your role too stupid to even know\nDamn son, what the hell?\nWe all need to think intergalactic\nAs I style as I smile\nFinally after awhile, hold it now\nThey come around\n\nOh, will they come around?\nWonder if they'll come around, now\nOh, oh will they come around\nWill they ever come around, now\nNow come around\nNow do

(I've landed, nigga)\nI'm extra (Cleveland status)\nHello\n\nHello hello I bring the new era of terror\nSpeaking and its peaking but its cool you hear me clearly\nIn the lac' how it sound when it's up\nDon't act you ain't fuckin' with it\nCudi hate the fronters\nThey always in the back, fronting, saying something\nUntil I, open my mothafuckin' mind and let it spill\nOver samples over sense over heavy kicks in the mix\nFigured I was all singing til I began ripping\nReady to die ever since my father died\nInfatuated with death since my uncles left\nGo through the ghost of my family\nDancing in the valley when they hear the harps playin'\nDay 'n' Nite in the night\nOh, I ever wondered if I get this rappin' right\nHmm, I know why the bitches treat me oh so, politely\nI need the mushu and this occurs to\nI'll explain more after a blunt or two\nHey\n\nOh, will they come around?\nWonder if they'll come around, now\nOh, oh will they come around\nWill they ever come around, now\nNow come around\nNow do you get it, now do you get it\nHomeboy, mothafucka, do you get it?\nNow do you get it, do you get it\nHomeboy, mothafucka, do you get it (get it)\n\nSome niggas wear a Jesus piece\nTrying to show their passion for ice\nInstead of trying to show their passion for Christ\nSo until I get my world right homie I'm Jesus chainless\nWaiting in the dungeon with the not many stainless\nI'll be buckin at my demons\nTruly for more reasons I couldn't put into words\nOnly assign melodies\nIf you ever hear a sweet sad sound\nThose are the profound tones of\nWhile I'm feeling lost, still waiting to found, down\nNot by a model bitch, in her peace and Carey Anne\nNew motivation for the new generation\nBorn in 96' watching reruns of Fresh Prince\nInspiration come from all different angles\nIt is tangled in between\nThe bullshit that can claim you\nAye LeBron play this song before\nYou step on the court\nThis could your alley-oop\nWhile you hop out the coupe\nNever made it on the team\nBut I'm pimpin for sport\nIgnorant to the fact I'm dying quick off this port\nIf any niggas set the goal for the sky to be the limit\nYou limit your role too stupid to even know\nDamn son, what the hell?\nWe all need to think intergalactic\nAs I style as I smile\nFinally after awhile, hold it now\nThey come around\n\nOh, will they come around?\nWonder if they'll come around, now\nOh, oh will they come around\nWill they ever come around, now\nNow come around\nNow do you get it, now do you get it\nHomeboy, mothafucka, do you get it?\nNow do you get it, do you get it\nHomeboy, mothafucka, do you get it (get it)\n\nGet wit' it!"}}, {"title": "CONFUSED!", "album": "Speedin' Bullet 2 Heaven", "year": "2015-07-31", "lyrics": "I might go losing it and drive off of a cliff\nFall in the void\nAnd if I blow my brains out all over the scene\nThat's madness curing sadness\nThese walls ain't talking back, might as well finally paint them black\nI'm out of ideas\nThe ceiling is all I have, downward from here\nI'm ripping apart\n\nWho am I? Who are we?\nWho am I? Who are we?\nAll I want is to feel complete\nWho am I? Who are we?\n\nConfused, truth is what I choose\nHeal I never do\nAsking, \"Who are you?\"\nI don't have one clue\nSeems I hate him, too\nSeems my color's blue\nWho?\n\nI always end up back in a cycle of shame\nLooking in the mirror is hard\nSome days, I hurt myself to distract me from distraction\nThat's madness fixing sadness\nGo on adventures to find that the answers aren't plain\nBut there's comfort in tears\nDecoding my sacred heart, flying from here\nNo more falling apart, ah\n\nWho am I? Who are we?\nWho am I? Who are we?\nAll I want is to feel complete\nWho am I? Who are we?\n\nI hate the drugs, but I love the numb\nI hate the gun, but I want the sun\nI hate the drugs, but I love the numb\nI hate the gun, but I want the sun\n\nConfused, truth is what I choose

brains out all over the scene\nThat's madness curing sadness\nThese walls ain't talking back, might as well finally paint them black\nI'm out of ideas\nThe ceiling is all I have, downward from here\nI'm ripping apart\n\nWho am I? Who are we?\nWho am I? Who are we?\nAll I want is to feel complete\nWho am I? Who are we?\n\nConfused, truth is what I choose\nHeal I never do\nAsking, \"Who are you?\"\nI don't have one clue\nSeems I hate him, too\nSeems my color's blue\nWho?\n\nI always end up back in a cycle of shame\nLooking in the mirror is hard\nSome days, I hurt myself to distract me from distraction\nThat's madness fixing sadness\nGo on adventures to find that the answers aren't plain\nBut there's comfort in tears\nDecoding my sacred heart, flying from here\nNo more falling apart, ah\n\nWho am I? Who are we?\nWho am I? Who are we?\nAll I want is to feel complete\nWho am I? Who are we?\n\nI hate the drugs, but I love the numb\nI hate the gun, but I want the sun\nI hate the drugs, but I love the numb\nI hate the gun, but I want the sun\n\nConfused, truth is what I choose (truth is what I choose)\nHeal I never do (heal, I never do)\nAsking, \"Who are you?\" (asking, \"Who are you?\")\nI don't have one clue (I don't have one clue)\nSeems I hate him, too (seems I hate him, too)\nSeems my color's blue, ooh\nWho?\n\nI hate the drugs, but I love the numb\nI hate the gun, but I want the sun\nI hate the drugs, but I love the numb\nI hate the gun, but I want the sun"}},

Good\" by Mase\nI got three chicks, one in the back, it's never up\nTwo chicks up in the front with me\nThey love the midwest accent thing\nSo I'm steady on my game talk\nSteady on my good side\nLove the Cleveland swag\nDoors swinging, we some clowns right?\nGirlies all around as we pull up to the Mirage\nAnd I just open up the doors on 'em\nCudder lean got 'em in my Bathing Apes\nGot 'em all intrigued\nAll I can do is just smile and wave\nCause that's how it be, when you paid\n\nI've been cruisin' in my old school\nWhile I'm rolling all through Cleveland, in the evening\n\nNow the mood is good, the champagne's flowin'\nAnd she's feeling me, I'm digging where we goin' (and uh)\nAfter the club we headed straight to the IHOP (the IHOP)\nBut I'm sipping slow, trying to remain at ease\nWaving my hand, doing my dance at peeps (what it do)\nMe and my leaners we gon' party and all that, and all that (and we will)\nSo we gather on a zip, my shit rock\nI rap hard, Kid Cudi got that mean mean, the crackheads\nHoes look who when I whip whip the cutlass, the cutlass\nSo I can't even trip because I love it when I'm ridin'\nThat Cleveland city whip appeal I need it I ain't lyin'\nI love it just as much as model girls and Hennessy cognac\nAnd it's all that, so I be\n\nI've been cruisin' in my old school\nWhile I'm rolling all through Cleveland, in the evening\n\n(Cudi man we gotta tell 'em how we do it in the NY)\nHey hey, yeah your boy stay fade\nHigher than you sire, yes that's how I stay\nAbout to blow fast you could call it Minute Maid\nBut I've never been that minute man I'm in it to amaze\nCudi killed the track, the flowers in the vase\nDude so cold you could put him in a grave\nHere with some leaners\nDude's washed up, you could call us the cleaners\nAbout to see home boy, sitting in the Beamer\nWith a dime chick cause she love my demeanor\nCudi, that's my buddy\nHe get a full discount, nigga just like a senior\nFloatin', smoking on that funky cold me-haze\nYou see, we cruisin' like the Nina and the Pinta\nCrack the Dutch, got light green with magenta\nI'll show ya how to do this\nYes I'm the instructor\nCome ride with a nigga cuz I'm the

slow\nPlaying, \"Feel So Good\" by Mase\nI got three chicks, one in the back, it's never up\nTwo chicks up in the front with me\nThey love the midwest accent thing\nSo I'm steady on my game talk\nSteady on my good side\nLove the Cleveland swag\nDoors swinging, we some clowns right?\nGirlies all around as we pull up to the Mirage\nAnd I just open up the doors on 'em\nCudder lean got 'em in my Bathing Apes\nGot 'em all intrigued\nAll I can do is just smile and wave\nCause that's how it be, when you paid\n\nI've been cruisin' in my old school\nWhile I'm rolling all through Cleveland, in the evening\n\nNow the mood is good, the champagne's flowin'\nAnd she's feeling me, I'm digging where we goin' (and uh)\nAfter the club we headed straight to the IHOP (the IHOP)\nBut I'm sipping slow, trying to remain at ease\nWaving my hand, doing my dance at peeps (what it do)\nMe and my leaners we gon' party and all that, and all that (and we will)\nSo we gather on a zip, my shit rock\nI rap hard, Kid Cudi got that mean mean, the crackheads\nHoes look who when I whip whip the cutlass, the cutlass\nSo I can't even trip because I love it when I'm ridin'\nThat Cleveland city whip appeal I need it I ain't lyin'\nI love it just as much as model girls and Hennessy cognac\nAnd it's all that, so I be\n\nI've been cruisin' in my old school\nWhile I'm rolling all through Cleveland, in the evening\n\n(Cudi man we gotta tell 'em how we do it in the NY)\nHey hey, yeah your boy stay fade\nHigher than you sire, yes that's how I stay\nAbout to blow fast you could call it Minute Maid\nBut I've never been that minute man I'm in it to amaze\nCudi killed the track, the flowers in the vase\nDude so cold you could put him in a grave\nHere with some leaners\nDude's washed up, you could call us the cleaners\nAbout to see home boy, sitting in the Beamer\nWith a dime chick cause she love my demeanor\nCudi, that's my buddy\nHe get a full discount, nigga just like a senior\nFloatin', smoking on that funky cold me-haze\nYou see, we cruisin' like the Nina and the Pinta\nCrack the Dutch, got light green with magenta\nI'll show ya how to do this\nYes I'm the instructor\nCome ride with a nigga cuz I'm the conductor\n\nI've been cruisin' in my old school\nWhile I'm rolling all through Cleveland, in the evening"}}, {"title": "CudderIsBack", "album": null, "year": "2010-01-26", "lyrics":

portrait on the wall\nTo hang in the dark of some parliamentary hall\n\nStay home a lot, no TV\nJust thoughts, and a heap of good weed\nSame jeans, same old Converse\nBape tees and the Walees, so works\nI'm cool, some niggas mad at it\nLookin' in from the outside, fantastic\nCan't keep the negative alive\nThey be on my dick, if Kid Cudi die\nDon't cry hater, I forgive\nNow go and get my album and get off my dick\nI smile and I\u2019m pleasant, the weed is the essence\nBut if I\u2019m in the club, we gon\u2019 tear this shit up\nI\u2019m talkin' 'bout shots, ridiculous amounts\nCause if you\u2019re gonna rage, should be all about\nTake, take another shot or you\u2019re soft\nDream On campaign I\u2019m the mother lovin' boss\nHaters suck my balls, two time\nI never say goodbye 'cause I\u2019m on mine\nAll my life, wanna do some' major\nNow every little thing I do might make it in the paper\nCudi found y\u2019all nigga, po-po (whatever)\nMad drunk in the street, no photo (I rage)\nHatin' motherfuckas, don't know yo\nI guess this was the life I chose\nWanna get up in my mind\nWanna know about me and Amanda Bynes (Amanda please)\nWanna know really, really, really who I\u2019m datin'\nIs she civilian or super duper famous? (hmmm)\nIs she African American, Caucasian, or Asian? (so many)\nOr maybe Spanish\nIt don\u2019t matter my nigga, I love them all\nAs long as she don\u2019t need stupid amounts of makeup\nTo makeup the self esteem\nSelfish dreams can reflect the blessing\nI am tap dancing on a cloud\nSuccessful raps, I might scream out loud\nPuttin' it down, for all I met\nTalking fans, I won't quit\nI\u2019m puttin' it down, for all I met\nTalking fans, I won't quit\n\nHey hey hey, whoa whoa whoooa (come on, come on)\nHey, whoa whoa whoooa (come on, come on)\nHey, whoa whoa whoooa\nHey, whoa whoa whoooa\nNa na na na na na\nGoodbye", "image":

you to sit for a portrait on the wall\nTo hang in the dark of some parliamentary hall\n\nStay home a lot, no TV\nJust thoughts, and a heap of good weed\nSame jeans, same old Converse\nBape tees and the Walees, so works\nI'm cool, some niggas mad at it\nLookin' in from the outside, fantastic\nCan't keep the negative alive\nThey be on my dick, if Kid Cudi die\nDon't cry hater, I forgive\nNow go and get my album and get off my dick\nI smile and I\u2019m pleasant, the weed is the essence\nBut if I\u2019m in the club, we gon\u2019 tear this shit up\nI\u2019m talkin' 'bout shots, ridiculous

smile\nOn top of the dreams is where I'm found\nSome figured I was Satan bound\nUntil I came back with a style I found\nThen all of a sudden they fixed they faces\nCause of who I know and the trail of places\nThat I've stepped\nHow many niggas wanna hate cause I left?\nHow could you blame me and my plan of attack?\nCause I'm risking my soul intact\nNow I'm heard all over the map\nOnly rule of thumb \u2013\nIt don't really matter just where you from\nAll that really matter is where you gon' go\nMaybe upstate for some\nBut you can\u2019t rule out these cats for gone\nSecond chances given out for some\nAll you gotta do is take advantage\nThen maybe you can get yourself a horse and carriage\nDone pimpin' you can think about marriage\nUntil then get it in\nFind yourself and let's begin\nI'ma tell you how in a minute\nI'ma show you how I be livin'\nFrom a long time ago, a young nigga, he was timid\nNow I'm zoned, see things so vivid\nHide my soul? Naw, homie, not even\nI'ma zone out 'til I lose feeling, remember\nI'ma be gone way past November\nEven, stay up there, up there\nFloatin', floatin', hopin'\nI can find peace somewhere\n\nIn my mind\nIt sounds like oooooooh\nWhen I'm gone\nIt feels like oooooooh\nWhen I'm zoned\nI'm feeling alright\nI'm feeling alright\nI'm feeling alright\nWhen I'm zoned\nI'm feeling alright\nI'm feeling alright\nI forget about it all\n\nBallin', is this allowed?\nWithout feelin' like Shallow Hal\nDiamonds on the Jesus piece for style\nBack in Cleveland City we ride around\nGreetin' my niggas with dap and pound\nSo if I fall I won't hit the ground\nThese are the things that'll make me smile\nKnowin' this blunt might burn a while\nI keep myself so lifted\nI am accustomed to new heights\nI feel perfect though they think it's worthless\nSee without my flight, man\nEverybody wanna be a critic\nI have my life and I will live it\nShut your mouth before I fuck it\nHa, my jokes, they will love it\nIf I'm seen on the scene with my slim cut jeans\nMore than likely I am faded man\nYou are not the shit if everywhere you go\nNiggas ain't sitting, standing 'round hating, so\nMy vice is when the lights start flashin'\nI'll be zonin', all alone then\nAnd the place where my mind is goin'\nFilled with songs that no one's knowin'\nAnd the Devil in a hot pink dress\nTryna ask me for one dance\nHe think he slick\nBut my guardians protect me from his wrath\nSo, in my place no hate shall enter\nLivin' high up there, up there\nCopin', copin', floatin'\nI will find peace somewhere\n\nIn my mind\nIt sounds like oooooooh\nWhen I'm gone\nIt feels like oooooooh\nWhen I'm zoned\nI'm feeling alright\nI'm feeling alright\nI'm feeling alright\nWhen I'm zoned\nI'm feeling alright\nI'm feeling alright\nI forget about it all\n\nIn my mind\nIt sounds like oooooooh\nWhen I'm gone\nIt feels like oooooooh\nWhen I'm zoned\nI'm feeling alright\nI'm feeling alright\nI'm feeling alright\nWhen I'm zoned\nI'm feeling alright\nI'm feeling alright\nI forget about it all"}}, {"title": "Dance 4 Eternity", "album": "Passion, Pain & Demon Slayin'", "year": "2016-12-16", "lyrics": "Hey, it's so hard to trust anyone\nHmm, so this is awesome\nYou got me smilin', yeah you're a lot of fun\nHmm, so this is awesome\nI wanna dance with you for eternity\nSure like to see that body wet\nOoh, sure like to see that body wet\nLet's make moments we couldn't possibly forget\n\nWhat a pleasure, so much pleasure\nExplore the moment, savor the moment\nOur bodies, puzzle piece\nYou're excited, I can feel you dripping\nDrippin', drippin'\nOoh, I love to see that body wet\nHmm, don't be shy with it\nHard to trust anyone anyone, anyone, anyone, anyone\nYeah, you're a lot of fun, a lot of fun, a lot of fun, a lot of fun\nDance for eternity, eternity, eternity, eternity, eternity, eternity\nOoh, sure like to see that body wet, that body wet\nYou couldn't possibly forget, forget\n\nHey, it's so hard to trust anyone\nHmm, so this is awesome\nYou got me smilin', yeah you're a lot of fun\nHmm, so this is awesome\nI wanna dance with you for eternity\nSure like to see that body wet\nHmm, sure like to see that body wet\nLet's make moments we couldn't possibly forget\n\nWhat a pleasure, so much pleasure\nExplore the moment, savor the moment\nOur bodies, puzzle piece\nYou're excited, I can feel you dripping\nDrippin', drippin'\nOoh, I love to see that body wet\nHmm, don't be shy with it\n\nHey, it's so hard to trust anyone\nHmm, so this is awesome\nYou got me smilin', yeah you're a lot of fun\nHmm, so this is awesome\nI wanna dance with you for eternity\nSure like to see that body wet\nHmm, sure like to see that body wet\nLet's make moments we couldn't possibly forget\n\nHard to trust anyone, anyone, anyone, anyone, anyone\nYeah, you're a lot of fun, a lot of fun, a lot of fun, lot of fun\nDance for eternity, eternity, eternity, eternity, eternity, eternity\nHmmm, sure like to see that body wet, your body wet\nYou couldn't possibly forget, forget", "image": "https://images.genius.com/efae5867d6e39372f9815e5f28cde6a5.1000x1000x1.jpg", "artist": "Kid Cudi", "raw": {"annotation_count": 10, "api_path": "/songs/2867534", "description": {"dom": {"tag": "root", "children": [{"tag": "p", "children": ["\u201cDance For Eternity\u201d is the first song in ", {"tag": "a", "attributes": {"href": "https://genius.com/albums/Kid-cudi/Passion-pain-demon-slayin"}, "data": {"api_path": "/albums/152011"}, "children": [{"tag": "em", "children": ["Passion, Pain & Demon Slayin'"]}]}, "s third act."]}, "", {"tag": "p", "children": [{"tag": "strong", "children": ["Act III: Niveaux de l'Amour"]}, " translates to Act III: Levels Of Love.

Hahaha.\")\n\nI am the one that you might see around town\nGiving up daps and pounds\nSo high up but I'm holdin' it down\nScreamin' what up?

you can call me Cudi\nOr Mr. Extravagant 'cause I'm getting my money\nWay my doors are swayin' its like a bird on wheels\nYou can come to Ohio and you can see how it feels\nAnd this the premier of that new-new here\nIt's gonna take you beyond\nWhere a jet can't Lear\nBut all you gon' hear\nIs somethin' crazy in fact\nHow I be burnin' the booth\nWe'll get you looser than Yak\nYep-yep, you got it right\nNow don't get left\nGet on your good foot\nIt's only right that you step\nAnd keep boppin' to this shit unfamiliar\nIf your main line got time then I be drillin' her\nI keep you in my realm\nI keep you in the sound\nI keep myself up high\nBecause the haze by the pound\nAnd my imagination\nYou can look all over the nation\nBut they ain't see\n\nYou can look all over\nBut no, you'll never find\nHot shit like mine\nWoop, it blow your mind\nYou can look all over\nBut no, you'll never find\nHot shit like mine\n'Cause I provide\nThat new new\n\nSalutations my niggas\nI'm aware that I'm different\nYou can still keep it hood\nWhile you're smokin' just listen\nIt dont matter your race\nJust take a blunt to the face\nAnd we all gon' rock\nGot to keep up the pace\nAnd them girls gon' twerk\nBecause the vibe is poppin'\nAs well as the bottles\nKeep it rockin' don't stop 'em\nAt the Motel-8\nWe can park out front\nYeah the flow is unleaded\nYou sucka niggas will front\n'Cause I'm Super-Cudder-Realistic-Leaner-Alidocius\nAnd rap ferocious\nI been coaching the league\nI bobble head the public\nIf you love it, M dub it\nBlood, sweat, and tears; homie, I'm made of it\nFinish the class if you think nothing 'bout it\nTell 'em like grandpa, you don't know nothing 'bout it\nWear kicks once, then the Leaner come up out 'em\nI been sayin' it, you was playin' him\nNow you know\n\nYou can look all over\nBut no, you'll never find\nHot shit like mine\nWoop, it blow your mind\nYou can look all over\nBut no, you'll never find\nHot shit like mine\n'Cause I provide\nThat new new\n\nWhat it be to my ladies\nWith the bodies that kill\nWe ain't boppin on money\nFuck with me cause you real\nSee you shakin' it fast\nOn some Mystical shit\nYou could slap that nigga\nIf he call you a bitch\nYeah I see you with that\nBut you should be on this\nIt's that Henney and Coca-Cola\nCome over and sit\nWon't you tell me your name\nTell me where you be at\nI know you know that them hot\nBut I don't wanna hear that\nYou see I aim for a check\nBefore I aim for sex\nNiggas aim for death\nThey tryin' to fuck with the blessed\nAin't no fuckin' with amateurs\nRun passed the novice\nSip hella lean\nTo see who talks the slowest\nAin't no stoppin' me at all\nYou'd need a sawed-off, or maybe a chainsaw\nAnd even at that\nThe crack that I brew is still new\nY'all niggas think acute\nBut Cudi is obtuse\n\nYou can look all over\nBut no, you'll never find\nHot shit like mine\nWoop, it blow your mind\nYou can look all over\nBut no, you'll never find\nHot shit like mine\n'Cause I provide\nThat new new"}}, {"title": "Day and Night", "album": null, "year": null, "lyrics": "Day and night (what, what)\nI toss and turn, I keep stressing my mind, mind (what, what)\nI look for

high just like I'm born to fly (To the moon)\nI'm in the court with marijuana eyes (Sorry judge}\nWe hit the clubs until the morning rise (Cause of last night)\nCause day 'n' nite (Day 'n' nite))\nWe run the streets hope I don't pay that price (Pray for me)\nThey got the nerve to tell me press my brakes (What)\nAnd if I do then how will rent get paid, paid\nSo now I'm thinkin that (What's your thought)\nTwo hundred stacks what would it bring me back (Thinkin to flip)\nEspecially now that recessions here (It's hard out here)\nMy only answers to my questions is, is (Let me figure out)\nOk now here's a thought (One more thought)\nStreets is a marriage that you can't divorce\nLife is a bitch but I think I fell in love (I love that bitch)\nSo I treat the game just like I'm sellin drugs, drugs\nCause day 'n' nite...\nThe lonely stoner seem to free his mind at night\nHe's all alone through the day 'n' nite\nThe lonely loner seem to free his mind at night, ah-ah, at nite\nCause day 'n' nite...\nThe lonely stoner seem to free his mind at night\nHe's all alone, some things will never change\nThe lonely loner seem to free his mind at night, ah-ah, at nite\nDay 'n' nite...\nI toss and turn, I keep stress in my mind, mind\nI look for peace and see I don't attain\nWhat I need for keeps, this silly game we play...play..\nNow look at this...\nMadness to magnets keeps attractin me, me\nI try to run, but see I'm not that fast\nI think I'm first, but surely finish last...last...\n\nHold the phone, the lonely stoner Mr. solo dolo\nHe's on the move can't seem to shake the shade\nWithin his dreams he sees the life he made, made\nThe pain is deep, a silent sleeper you won't hear a peep, peep\nThe girl he wants don't seem to want him too\nIt seems the feelings that she had are through, through\n\nSlow mo, when the tempo slows up and creates that new, new\nHe seems alive, though he is feelin blue\nThe sun is shinnin man he's super cool, cool\nThe lonely nites, they fade away he slips into his white Nikes\nHe smokes a clip and then he's on the way\nTo free his mind in search of...\nTo free his mind in search of...\nTo free his mind in search of...\n\n\u00a0

I told you what that is, that's a alien bruv, believe it\n(Those guys didn't think I would do it, I told you I was gonna do it)\n\nSee, I could never have a desk job\nMy work take a nigga

a whim\nGot dinner in a few with prince Sheikh\nKanye changed a nigga life twice\nGotta ride, gotta rep, ay\nGetting rid of all the dead weight\nNiggas really want me dead, hate\nNot my fault I'm intriguing\nDrinkin' and drivin': no weavin'\nPop a molly, feelin' ten again\nProject X type weekend\nExcept a nigga damn near thirty\nLike twenty one had never ended\nHere I go with my second wind,

hitting corners hard\nYeah I gotta hit them corners hard\n\nI guess I'm just a lost cause\nJust a skinny nigga with so many flaws\nStarin' in that night, tight jawed\nFingers digging right inside my palm\nWaitin' waitin' for the calm\nSeem to think I know what's goin' on\nI'm finally comin' alive\nAnd it seems the ghost is movin' on\n\nYou know what that is? I told you what that is, that's a alien bruv, believe it\n(Those guys didn't think I would do it, I told you I was gonna do it)\n\nSee, I could never have a desk job\nMy work take a nigga abroad\nMeeting up late with foreign broads\nRelaxing cause a nigga hustle hard\nMan I gotta take a load off\nNeed a dime that'll take her clothes off\nTook a trip out to Doha\nFilmin' short films on a whim\nGot dinner in a few with prince Sheikh\nKanye changed a nigga life twice\nGotta ride, gotta rep, ay\nGetting rid of all the dead weight\nNiggas really want me dead, hate\nNot my fault I'm intriguing\nDrinkin' and drivin': no weavin'\nPop a molly, feelin' ten again\nProject X type weekend\nExcept a nigga damn near thirty\nLike twenty one had never ended\nHere I go with my second wind, bitch\nYou already know I'm goin' in\nAnd I've been waitin'\nI've been waitin' to shit on you\n\nYeah, G.O.O.D. music we the family\nKid motherfuckin' Cudi"}}, {"title": "Destination: Mother Moon", "album": "Satellite Flight: The Journey To Mother Moon ", "year": "2014-02-25", "lyrics": "", "image": "https://images.genius.com/f93aafaafd092a8bb9b2224aea7385f6.670x670x1.jpg", "artist": "Kid Cudi", "raw": {"annotation_count": 2, "api_path": "/songs/369622", "description": {"dom": {"tag": "root", "children": [{"tag": "p", "children": ["Another epic intro to the Moon Man\u2019s album from the man himself with nothing but vibes that are out of this world.

Scott, last name Mescudi\nI will say it now so you all can say it properly\nEven for awhile lotta people stayed mocking me\nThen I went G.O.O.D. cause of 'ye now they jocking me\nI have the same sound, same old fire, same lion heart\nAnd I stayed smoking sour, every single minute now, gotta say an hour\nI feel I am cross of John Lennon and my father\nI remember when I finally left Cleveland\nBeing cool, it wasn't the only reason\nMy heart had urges, the feelings\nSomething special you could feel up in the evening\nWhen the moons full and the drink is poured\nAnd most of the real pretty girls are whores\nNow I gotta say get the fuck outta here, I don't know you\nNo, you can't chill in here\nNa na na na\nYeah yeah yeah\nNow\nDo you, do you, do you\nDo you get it, get it\nNa na na na\nWhoa.. na na\nNow\nDo you, do you, do you\nDo you get it, get it\nMy last name Mescudi, first name Scott\nI was the kid you knew who liked to joke and clown a lot\nBut when I went home school work to the side\nI'mma go and study how to finish up these rhymes\nMaybe hit a kidney and my family hit the grind\nBefore I feel I'll never ever find my own mind\nLosing my pops really fucked me up\nAt the time in my mind I thought my luck was up\nIts mostly cause I never got to show what I dream\nI guess its cause I never had the time to let it show\nBut now I got an op im bout to give to the public\nI know he lookin' down, I know he gotta love it\nOhio got a spokesman\nThey wanna know if I really smoke\nCome on fam\nAre you lookin at these black lips?\nAll the time im flatlined stoned bitch\nNa na na na\nYea yea yea\nNow\nDo you, do you, do you\nDo you get it, get it\nNa na na na\nWhoa.. na na\nNow\nDo you, do you, do you\nDo you get it (Yea) , get it\nI'm scott mescudi\nNever let the sucker motha' fuckers get the best of me\nGoin back to Cleveland, dap and pound her is my ?\nStand up nigga\nWhen people hate on Cleveland I stand up nigga\nWOW in my A.P.C\nAA get the best plain tees\nWhen I head to the grammys I might dress tacky\nCause all the people care about is what im wearing\nIn the bag it should be about the sweet fuckin album\nLets talk about the fact you want a sweet fuckin album\nSome talk shit makin' videos and jokin\nNow your all fans of my shaft think I stroke em\nI told you, I was not playin'\nFrom here on believe the words that im sayin'\nBut know I won't lead you astray\nJust take heed to the words that I say\nNa na na na\nYea yea yea\nNow\nDo you, do you, do you\nDo you get it, get it\nNa na na na\nWhoa.. na na\nNow\nDo you,

oh\nSee 'em in the ditch, see 'em out, hit the exit\nCan't stand to hear a bitch nigga mouth\nI took a hook in the road to get in the mode, geronimo\nGet in my jeans, white tee, Cleveland fitted\nHoes know me 'round the map, I can't hide the old summers\nHit the fuse and I lit it, the rest unfolds\nTell me how the fuck does he does it?\nLevels unreachable, can't pin him to a mold\nIt's like a nigga been here before\nShit is a bore, my thoughts soar in the AM\nSlay them like a machine round the clock\nWith the 12 gauge aim, telling Satan to fuck off\nHated the hand I was given\nTossed that shit back, like God must be kidding\nAnd not for a nigga like me, not for the family\nNot for the similar plans I just dumped\nAnd I made me some choices, heard voices follow\nNo, can't stop a man with passion\nThese hoes don't distract a god, I am no clown\nGrown man laying the stones all around in my throne\nMy kingdom, throwing from space\nFuck all expressions on face, this is the case\nI'm in place to be great, hmm\nNo fakes, raising the stakes\nI'm in place to be great, hmm, hmm, hmm\n\nUh, doing music, TV and movies\nSitting on the floors we ain't heard of\nAnd the media wanna act like I ain't out here (I'm out here)\nRunning laps around these hoes (for years)\nRunning the game with no cheat codes\nUnfuckwittable with two T's nigga, who else but Cud?\nGive a motherfuck\n\nI does it, I, I, I does it and, I does it, yeah\nI, I, I does it yeah, I, I does it yeah, oh, oh, oh\nNigga, I does it, yeah, oh, I, nigga, I does it, yeah\nOh, oh, oh, I does it, yeah, I does it, yeah, oh, oh\n\nThought the kid dough cause I'm in a oven often\nThe kush in the lungs, a bushel of nugs\nAwaken the dope, but they never dissolve the coke\nGot the homies in the hood and they wanna rage on\nFast lane, pushing to the limit\nUh, enjoy the spoils, but don't bask in it\nBut see, I really wanna get me a farm and grow crop\nLive with some girls who love me and this cock\nThe more I grow, the more I double in powers\nNon-ambitious for cowards, trippy go for toe\nWon't be a drone clone, half-hearted\nSheep in the herd, brainwashed at what cost\nI'm a raise some hell, you know this\nAnd if I piss people off along the way, bonus\nCause these niggas are stale chips\nAll around thinking they're fresh with the stale shit\nAnd corny bitches need corny niggas, that's well fit\nGod has a plan for everybody but I'm it, Chosen\nScotty 'bout to even the mood, get lost in the tune\nForget it all, take flight my doves\nSay we are the, we are the knights in the world\nListen baby can you see in the club, we gettin' bent up\nThe sun up, egg, cheese, sunny-side up\nI'm waiting for you, and taking the cue\nHaving a drink, let's make it a few\nHere's to you, you, you, and you\nSalute, hmmm, I bid you adieu\nSalute\n\nUh, doing music, TV and movies\nSitting on the floors we ain't heard of\nAnd the media wanna act like I ain't out here (I'm out here)\nRunning laps around these hoes\nWinning the game, no cheat codes\nUnfuckwittable with two T's nigga, who else but Cud?\nGive a mother fuck\n\nI does it, I, I, I does it and, I does it yeah\nI, I, I does it yeah, I, I does it yeah, oh, oh, oh\nNigga, I does it yeah, oh, I, nigga I does it yeah\nOh, oh, oh, I does it yeah, I does it yeah, oh, oh"}}, {"title": "Don't Play This Song", "album": "Man on the Moon II: The Legend

take the trip unless I'm sloppy drunk\nI pray for my mom, how a teach had a son\nThat never gave a fuck about a Scantron\nAll I wanted was to be a human being\nAnd show all the world some new colors and scenes\nImagine all types of beautiful scenery\nI remember when I first had trees\nSmoked out a Black and Mild, so dumb of me\nNow, I'm grape Cigarillo man\nAny young black kid, guaranteed fan\nHold it down, humble pie on the humble\nAnd I treat normal girls like models\nReckless and young and my, my mom's calling\nThink I should hit decline\nI'm numb faced while I'm thinking 'bout suicide\n\nWanna know what it sound like when I'm not on drugs\nPlease, please don't play this song\nR-r-r-r-right, r-right, r-right-right-right\nTryin to get my mind, my mind, my mind right

high just like we should\nYou know the saying, ain't no delaying\nGotta gets the getting while the getting's good\nYeah demented, my brain was forced to transform\nWise up, I'm checking the gate\nOn humble tales and minimum wage\nThe blogs tell it \u2013 Cudi's lame\nWearing a kilt, he must be gay\nLet's keep it trill, fuck being discreet\nBut some girls tweet how they miss my meat\nYeah, Cudders \u2013 HBO, that Vitamin Water\nThat's money to blow 'cause it's money for blow\nDon't take no shit, you can blame my ma\nI'm in the maze, I'm in a daze, I'm losing it\nI'm lockin' in my rocketship\nI'll be a blip on your radar bitch\nFeels like things can be covered\nUntil the day I'm above myself hovered\n\nWanna know what it sound like when I'm not on drugs\nPlease, please don't play this song\nR-r-r-r-right, r-right, r-right-right-right\nTryin to get my mind, my mind, my mind right right\nPeople think they really being helpful\nBy tellin me to please be careful, yeah

headed nigga ever since I was wild, a child\nBut my ambitions made bitches beg for attention\nDJ\u2019s un-mixin' their mixes, just to toss in some Cudder\nAnd I tried to tell my mother\nBut she ain't underdig, figure me on some other\nBut see my mommy 'ain't a fronter\nSo nowadays she calls me a bad motherfucker\n\nAnd, just when it seemed that the game is hopeless\nWe arranged some thing for a dose of dopeness\nI, I do, what I do\nAnd, I, I do, what I do\nAnd, just when it seems that the game is hopeless\nRearrange some things for a dose of dopeness\nI, I do, what I do\nAnd, I, I do, what I

monumental\nAnd I don't need much but Dot instrumentals\nThat's how I lay the stencil, me smilin' up out the window\nI'm in the leaner dome, that's my crib on the moon\nAnd I'm livin' in hotel rooms\nIn the mirror, laughing at my crooked tooth\nHow a nigga eat, is how a nigga speak\nAnd how a nigga live, is sacrifice was big\nAnd I'mma say it right before the hook\nMaybe in due time, Pimpin', I'mma write a book\nBut now I'mma play my Andre 3000\nAnd dream about an island wit model girls eyein'\n\nUm... hello\nHey baby\nUm... yeah\nSome people call me Cudi, some people call me Scott\nIt don't matter what you wanna call me, as long as you call me something\nAs long as you call me, baby\nBut um...\nYou know...\nYou seem real pretty\nAnd I ain't talkin' bout how you look\nI'm

I feel like that\u2019s holding us back as a culture, as black people; it doesn\u2019t advance us in any way, shape or form. We\u2019ve been doing that same thing for years now, it\u2019s like like, what, four decades of the same old . Sorry for my language. And I feel like, you know, if you\u2019re gonna be an artist, there\u2019s a time when you just have to embrace the responsibility and understand that the power of music is something so special, and to be able to do in on this magnitude where you reach millions of people, it\u2019s like why not use that for good, why not tell kids something that they can connect with in their life.\nAnd really, my mission statement since day one - And I'm getting so worked up talking about this. All I wanted to do was help kids not feel alone and stop kids from comitting suicide. *Applause* Thank you.\nAnd I'm never trying to be political, and I'm actually like shaking, I can't believe I'm saying this, but- *Arsenio interrupts*\nArsenio: Those two specific things, where does that come from?\nCudi: Well, I've dealt with suicide for the past 5 years, you know? Like, it wasn't a week or day that didn't go by where I was just like \"You know? I want to check out\" You know? I know what that feels like, and I know it comes from loneliness. I know it comes from not having self-worth, not loving yourself. And these are things that - you know, kids don't have music that can coach them and give them that guidance.\nI didn't have that. I had to listen to Jay-Z and take certain things from it and the other shit, I just didn't know what he was talking about. *laughter* And like, now I'm 30  and I'm like, \"Oh! that's what Hov was talking about, I get it now\"\nBut what about the kids who- you never really had an artist where you connected with them all across the board. And I think that that's my job, I'm just really trying to guide people and help people, cause loneliness is a terrible, terrible thing man, and if you don't know how to conquer it, it can eat you

I feel like that\u2019s holding us back as a culture, as black people; it doesn\u2019t advance us in any way, shape or form. We\u2019ve been doing that same thing for years now, it\u2019s like like, what, four decades of the same old . Sorry for my language. And I feel like, you know, if you\u2019re gonna be an artist, there\u2019s a time when you just have to embrace the responsibility and understand that the power of music is something so special, and to be able to do in on this magnitude where you reach millions of people, it\u2019s like why not use that for good, why not tell kids something that they can connect with in their life.\nAnd really, my mission statement since day one - And I'm getting so worked up talking about this. All I wanted to do was help kids not feel alone and stop kids from comitting suicide. *Applause* Thank you.\nAnd I'm never trying to be political, and I'm actually like shaking, I can't believe I'm saying this, but- *Arsenio interrupts*\nArsenio: Those two specific things, where does that come from?\nCudi: Well, I've dealt with suicide for the past 5 years, you know? Like, it wasn't a week or day that didn't go by where I was just like \"You know? I want to check out\" You know? I know what that feels like, and I know it comes from loneliness. I know it comes from not having self-worth, not loving yourself. And these are things that - you know, kids don't have music that can coach them and give them that guidance.\nI didn't have that. I had to listen to Jay-Z and take certain things from it and the other shit, I just didn't know what he was talking about. *laughter* And like, now I'm 30  and I'm like, \"Oh! that's what Hov was talking about, I get it now\"\nBut what about the kids who- you never really had an artist where you connected with them all across the board. And I think that that's my job, I'm just really trying to guide people and help people, cause loneliness is a terrible, terrible thing man, and if you don't know how to conquer it, it can eat you alive.\nArsenio: How are you right now?\nCudi: I'm good, I'm alright."}}, {"title": "Edge of the Earth / Post Mortem Boredom", "album": "Speedin' Bullet 2 Heaven", "year": "2015-12-04", "lyrics": " Part 1: Edge of the Earth\nThis is a special presentation\nHello everybody\nHello everybody\nHello everybody\nHello everybody\nHello everybody\nCome on down\n\nHanging on the edge of the earth\nOh, what a beautiful scene\nOh, what a beautiful end scene to see\nLaying on a cliff, staring at the stars\nOh, what a beautiful scene\nOh, what a beautiful ending\n\nBits and pieces are wrong with me\nIf so won't you sing along with me?\nHere's one more for the people lost in insanity\nCover your wounds, don't show your scars\nSmile for friends and carry on\nHere's one more for the people lost in insanity\n\nHanging on the edge of the earth\nOh, what a beautiful scene\nOh, what a beautiful end scene to see\nLaying on a cliff, staring at the stars\nOh, what a beautiful scene\nOh, what a beautiful ending\n Part 2: Post Mortem Boredom\n\"There is an epidemic of mass murder being committed by a virtual army of unidentified assassins.

me\n\nI once used to dream of peace until I found you\nOnce upon a time baby\nI once used to dream so sweet until I had a taste of you\nOnce upon a time baby\nReachin' out to outer space, dancin' to awesome sounds\nThis all new to you\nI'm reachin' out to hold you close so I don't slip away\nExplore a new approach, a whole new free I'd say\n\nGet ready, pop it, let's go\nIntergalactic you and me\nIntergalactic you and me\nGet ready, pop it, let's go\nIntergalactic you and me\nIntergalactic you and me\nGet ready, pop it, let's go\nIntergalactic you and me\nIntergalactic you and me\nGet ready, pop it, let's go\nIntergalactic you and me\nIntergalactic you and me\n\nI know it's easy to imagine\nBut it's easier to just do\nSee, if you can't do what you imagine\nThen what is imagination to you?\nJust a waste of space in your brain\nTo take the place of hate or things all the same\nTell me your secrets, the things that make you tick\nI like when you talk, because your voice is angelesque\nAy, I want to kiss you on your space below you navalette\nThe place that you keep neat, so moist, like a towelette\nThis will mark the day our minds and souls will connect\nLet's not forget the sex, my heart you can collect, now, now\nMy heart you can collect, now, now\nMy heart you can collect, now, now\nHave just one more cap, babe, babe, babe\nHave just one more stem, babe\n\nGet ready, pop it, let's go\nIntergalactic you and me\nIntergalactic you and me\nGet ready, pop it, let's go\nIntergalactic you and me\nIntergalactic you and me\n\nPop it, ready, go\nLet it, take, take, take, take over\nGet ready, pop it, let's go\nGet ready, let, let, it take you over\nGet ready, pop it, let's go\nTake it, just let it, take, take, you over\nGet ready, let's go, let's go, hey\n\nGet ready, pop it, let's go\nIntergalactic you and me\nIntergalactic you and me\nGet ready, pop it, let's go\nIntergalactic you and me\nIntergalactic you and me\nGet ready, pop it, let's go\nIntergalactic you and me\nEnter galactic you and me\nGet ready, pop it, let's go\nEnter galactic you and me\nEnter galactic you and me\n\nSoon after falling into a deep and psychedelic state\nTo escape the prison of our reality\nOur hero becomes trapped in his own peaceful place\nWhich immediately becomes his sanctuary\nA place filled with his wildest dreams\nThis is his new home"}},

told my baby\nThis what this bitch tells me\n\nShe said: I keep on running, keep on running, and nothing works\nI can't get away from you, no\nI keep on ducking, keep on ducking you, nothing helps\nI

you before, but don't know where I seen ya\nOh I remember now, it's something that I dreamed of\nDon C says she cool, but don't let her fuck your cream up\nMonica Lewinsky on the dress, you take her

helps\nI can't stop missing you\n\nIt's like I'm her new nightmare, she ain't escaping\nIt makes me feel a bit complete\nKnowing someone you love don't feel the same way about ya\nMemories they soon delete\nA couple weeks, no talking, I see my baby\nI missed you so damn much\nHey, I wish we could start over, I told my baby\nThis what this bitch tells me\n\nShe said: I keep on running, keep on running, and nothing works\nI can't get away from you, no\nI keep on ducking, keep on ducking you, nothing helps\nI can't stop missing you\n\nYeah, cause I'm in the magazines, on the TV\nNo matter where you are, you might hear me\nI'm in the magazines, on the TV\nNo matter where you go, you might see me\n\nI'm Yeezy, she say \"Hi, I'm Aria\"\nNo, you a angel, you wave \"Hi\" to Aaliyah\nI got a show in Korea, they built a new arena\nWhy don't you come and watch a nigga tear the whole scene up\nI know I seen you before, but don't know where I seen ya\nOh I remember now, it's something that I dreamed of\nDon C says she cool, but don't let her fuck your cream up\nMonica Lewinsky on the dress, you take her to the cleaners\nSure enough, a week later, I'm in extra love\nAnd everybody know she's mine so she extra plugged\nEvery bouncer, every club show her extra love\nWe just praying the new fame don't get the best of us\nBut all good things gotta come to a en-a\nShe let it go to her head, \"No, not my Aria\"\nThe height of her shopping was writer's blocking me\nI couldn't get my shit out anyway, I hope you die Aria!\n\nI keep on running, keep on running\nAnd nothing works, I

it, and even if I'm never weeded\nThey will still seek it\nI write it on crypt leaf\nSo the, the people read it, when I'm gone and dead\nWhat is in his head, Complex magazine\nCouldn't craft a better sketch of the depths that linger above\nI talk to my dads corpse when I'm stoned enough\nI be rollin' up, he see me shine see me holdin' up\nThey wasn't lyin' bout me takin' the train\nBefore I had the chain catch me on the jmc\nI know some niggas hate me, I see you muggin' hard\nAh, you can't deny me, they all salute the underdog\nI ain't gotta say it, I'm kinda like a big kid\nYeah\n\nExcuse me, excuse my mood my nigga, yeah\nExcuse my mood baby, yeah\nExcuse my mood baby\n\nNow, we told you all a year ago\nThat we weren't playin' anymore\nAnd we mean what we say at dream on GOOD\nThis is

yeah\n\nGotta get it through my thick head\nI was so close to being dead, yeah\nLife, live it, with nobody's help tips\nMan, I'm just walking without being led\nSee the world is so crazy and filled with such risk\nAnd man, I just know I gotta dodge them, yeah\nThe beginning is always followed by an end\nIn the in-between time I'm not running or hiding\n\nSee things do come around\nAnd make sense eventually\nThings do come around\nBut some things trouble me\n\nThe people I've met, and the places I've been\nAre all what make me the man I so proudly am\nBut I wanna know one thing, when did I become a ghost?\nI'm mostly confused about the world I live in\nYou think that I'm lonely, well I probably am\nOne thing that still gets me, when did I become a ghost?\n\nTried to fight it, but soon that gave in\nWent down a road with no lights on\nCan't describe it, and you don't move like them\nYou become their worst nightmare\nYou remember the things that your parents had said\nAnd well, rather find out the hard way\nYou should tell a friend to tell a friend to tell a friend\nI keep with my stroll, I'm not running or hiding\n\nSee things do come around\nAnd make sense eventually\nThings do come around\nBut some things still trouble me\n\nThe people I've met, and the places I've been\nAre all what make me the man I so proudly am\nBut I wanna know one thing, when did I become a ghost?\nI'm mostly confused about the world I live in\nYou think that I'm lonely, well I probably am\nOne thing that still gets me, when did I become a ghost?\n\nOhh\nI hope they understand, that I really understand\nThat they don't understand\nI hope they understand, that I really understand\nThat they don't understand\nI really understand that they...\nI really think I, umm...\nI hope they understand that I really understand\nThat they don't understand\nWhoa\nListen to me\nOhh\nListen to me\nWhoa"}}, {"title": "Girls", "album": "Indicud", "year": "2013-04-12",

and smoke this tree\nDown for doing acid\nSlim up on that waist, but that ass fit\nLet me feel your skin on mine unwind speak whats on your mind\nAnd tell me somethin that moves me\nSeen all types, different continents\nNothing more intriguing than an accent\nThat's a one, two, double up, get it up\nSo many surprises, so many colors and sizes\nLove it (mmh) they're so dope, they're so

existing on the moon.\"\n\nHmm, hmm, alright\nHmm, hmm, hmm\n\nDrinking again, drinking again\nBottles up, I'm in it to win\nWith none of my friends, just me and this bottle\nPeople say that I'm off, say that I'm off\nI wouldn't doubt it if you were me\nFree as a bird, flying over mountains\nAnd I don't know where I'm going\nBut I'm going\n\nIt's all happening\nI'm going\nIt's all happening\n\nHate what I see, hate what I see\nI'm over it, I need me some change\nSomething to feel good, get me on a level\nNo, no, no need to cry, no need to cry\nYou straighten up, you're such an adult\nYou pay all your bills, yet you are a zombie\nAnd you don't know where you're going\nBut you're going\n\nIt's all happening\nI'm going\nIt's all happening\nWe're going\nIt's all happening"}},

You're crazy, man. You know what? When you said that last time, I was kinda trippin', right? But now, you're right. I am crazy. But you know what else? I don't give a fuck. I don't give a fuck about myself. You remember that, motherfucker. Cause I'm the one y'all need to be worried about\n\nYou knowin' I'm vicious\nDaddy home niggas ain't doing the dishes\nWhat is this?\nFor years I've been feelin' suspicious\nBout certain niggas motives and morals\nAnd such, and like that\nI done landed the ship\nParallel parked in the park in the dark\nDon't be concerned if I'm makin' a grip\nOwn half of my masters, so muthafuck you bastards\nClones all a fuckin' round\nWhen I step on the scene don't hear a sound\nWhat more could I do?\nSo much, too much\nThe Chosen One has said stand up, be proud of you\nAnd I'm here, no fear\nBeen hearin' all the calls, the chants, the cheers\nWe're clear\nWhen I'm leavin' the show\nYou knew I was gon' be back to go yam on these hoes\n\nI hear the madness\nI pray I lean towards the light, ya know?\nI'm just livin'\nTryna stay outta' trouble, minding my own\nThe angels they protect me from the horror in my dome\nI don't wanna have to tell you again friend\nPlease, leave a real nigga alone\n\nGoodbye cruel world\nI'm leaving you today\nGoodbye, Goodbye\n\nPsych ya mind, who hit'cha?\nThought I would be dead\nYea, I figured\nNah, I'll be pullin' the trigger\nUntil then I'm coastin', roastin', leavin' you Ghostin'\nNow, Check the approach\nFinesse, the best, hittin' reps\nSets, gains\nCall me whatever you like\nBut remember one thing\nForever no matter what, I reign\nWe don't care about your money\nYou corny on and off the cob\nA shame, A 1 lame\nA cover-up, you got no personality\nHide behind your wealth to hide oneself, sad\nThe shit is so twilight zone\nBatman left Gotham now shits all wrong\nJokes on you Luke\nHere is the Demolition Man\nA nigga got a plan and I gotta\nGet em 1 by 1, 2 by 2\nThe kids need the guidance\nThat real life\nAll in bitch you know my face\nMy name\nThe style\nThe catalog\nAhhhh\nCud Life the #1, 1\nCud Life the #1, 1\nCud Life the #1, 1 under the sun\nThe Chosen\nFucker\n\nI hear the madness\nI pray I lean towards the light, ya know?\nI'm just livin'\nTryna' stay outta trouble, minding my own\nThe angels they protect me from the horror in my dome\nI don't wanna have to tell you again friend\nPlease, leave a real nigga

recent in time, made me sad\nWhen I recollect how it use to be like David and Goliath\nKinda like me and the Devil\nTryna rip out my soul\nTryna catch a nigga on sleep, no-no\nYou can try again and I'll be ready\nWon't let you kill me in my dream like Freddy Krueger\nNo, I'm not no loser, I'll see you in Hell\n\nAt the end of the day, day\nMy momma told me don't let no one break me\nLet no one break me\nAt the end of the day, day\nNobody, nobody ever could stop me\nEver could stop me\nAt the end of the day, day\nYou can't regret it if you were trying\nIf you were trying\nAt the end of the day, day\nI'm walking with a heart of a lion\nYeah\n\nPlease save a kid that needs some help\nAnd I can't see ahead of me so I move in stealth\nHide and seek within a dream I seem to glide above my horror\nThough I feel I'll never be complete inside the dark I borrow\nTo proceed and remain intact my mental is so unstable\nAnd they talk and judge a man\nThey have no clue of what I'm capable\n'Til I show a side of me no one had thought could be within\nI told you, no I'm not a loser, I'll see you in Hell\n\nAt the end of the day, day\nMy momma told me don't let no one break me\nLet no one break me\nAt the end of the day, day\nNobody, nobody ever could stop me\nEver could stop me\nAt the end of the day, day\nYou can't regret it if you were trying\nIf you were trying\nAt the end of the day, day\nI'm walking with a heart of a lion\nYeah\n\nNo, no, no, no, no, no, no\nYeah, no, yeah\nNo, no, no, no, no, no, no\nYeah, no, yeah\nNo, no, no, no, no, no, no\nYeah, no, yeah\nNo, no, no, no, no, no, no\nYeah, no, yeah\n\nI'm just a kid who needs no help\nI've achieved a bigger thing\nNo cash or check could be more blessed\nAnd if you had ever seen the things I've seen up in my slumber\nYou'd be shook, stay awake\nNo need to run, your fate would follow\nYou should know, not for the faint at heart\nThis world understands no coward\nIt's a goal, a simple code\nI stay on the grind to the 25th hour\nAnd I know\nThe fight in me is somewhere hiding deep within\nI told you\nNo, I'll never let you drag me down to Hell\n\nAt the end of the day, day\nMy momma told me don't let no one break me\nLet no one break me\nAt the end of the day, day\nNobody, nobody ever could stop me\nEver could stop me\nAt the end of the day, day\nYou can't regret it if you were trying\nIf you were trying\nAt the end of the day, day\nI'm walking with a heart of a lion\nYeah\n\nNo, no, no, no, no, no, no\nYeah, no, yeah\nNo, no, no, no, no, no, no\nYeah, no, yeah\nNo, no, no, no, no, no, no\nYeah, no,

night? Night\nHave you ever been to heaven at night?\n\nHeaven at night\nHave you ever been to heaven at night?\nClosing your eyes\nThe feeling so right\nAt first you might see just one bright beam of light\nClutching your soul to the toll of the bright\nHappy unites\nAnd feelings take flight\nBlind to the evils, you give them no sight\nFocus on floating, your focus is tight\nLike you rewrote an essay for a class to pass in the night\nHave you ever seen an ending so nice?\nYou feel so free, like you're high as a kite\nLike how you feel if you drink some Bud Light\nFollowed by yay\nModels who smile, then tilt their head back\nThese are a few of the visions I like\nMixed in with light\nThese are my favorites to dream in the night\nThis is my heaven at night\n\nHave you\nEver been to heaven at night?\nHeaven at night\nOh, have you\nEver been to heaven at night?\nHeaven at night\n\nMan, oh, I need\nWhat the world can't give me\nCan't give me\nMan, oh, I see\nWhat the world can't show me\nCan't show me\nDog, oh, I lack\nWhat the world can't give me\nCan't give me\nDog, oh, I sing it\nBut the world can't hear me\nCan't hear me\nHeaven at night\nHeaven at night\n\nHave you\nEver been

even if I could bra\nI do it all again real shit bra\nAdvocate rappin' and doing me\nI ended up rapping renewing me\nEnded up being better then the last\nWhole new Cudi for the new class\nEvery time I think about the first step I ever took alone made me realize this prince was made for the throne\nDefeated the beast, Sword from the stone, smoking so much weed I'm better off alone\nIn my own zone, in my own zone, I'm so gone never the less\nI can't disappear stress, my life is way beyond your momma knows best\nYou can't forget I'm blessed, the feel is so curse, I can't stop the verse from spitting\nWhen I'm feeling like I'm phony cause I speak my thoughts every time I think them up\nI guarantee I will win if I was ever wrong this moment ain't it\nSo I am psychic in the in end, I think my thoughts and reality lets them\nIn, in, in\nTell me who, is all ready to go\nTell me who... is all ready to go\nTell me who is all ready, to go higher up say higher up"}}, {"title": "Highs N'

I be high when I'm shopping for expensive clothes\nI be high when I get what I couldn't before\nI be high in the club while I'm poppin bub\nI be high when I'm cruisin, sittin' on them dubs\nBut I be low at the shows in my dressing room\nI be low when I see that I'm a different dude\nI be low on the plane looking at the sky\nI be low but my highs keep a nigga tight\n\nI be high, then I be low\nI

I'm high when I know the places we can go\nI be high when I think of what the future hold\nI be high when she ask for my room number\nI be high but my lows keep a nigga humble\n\nI be high, then I be low\nI be low, then I be high\nIt's like a battle knife to a gun fight\nBut I be cool, this the story of my life\nI be high, then I be low\nI be low, then I be high\nIt's like a battle knife to a gun fight\nNo need to worry, this the story of my life\n\nI was high when the label said that I was dope\nI was high in my eyes cause I had hope\nI was high When I first had the taste of love\nI was high when I left the city I was from\nAnd I was low when I had a recent heartbreak\nI was low cause I truly thought I had a mate\nI was low when I lost her over silliness\nI was low cause she twisted what my words meant\nBut I was high when I finally had the chance to see\nEverything that's pretty ain't always good for me\nI was high when she first said I like you\nMan I must be too high to even write, dude\nAnd these things show you growth\nSome niggas show a little\nBut I'll show you the most\nHighs and lows and succeed for sho\nThe only thing left to do is say a toast\nCause...\n\nI be high, then

Okay. Just wanna check the mic first (?) get the sound right. This is not comedy hour, I promise.\nThe funny thing is: I used to go to this school. And my class used to sit like in this area, here. Yeah, O2, who\u2019s an O2er?\nKendra, come here! Kendra, come on! Kendra (?) everybody! Come, give me a hug! I mean, how long has it been, two decades? Come up here! I was at all doing me. (?). How about that \u2013 reunion!\nOkay. So, it\u2019s just a little surreal, I haven\u2019t been in this room since 1999, 2000 maybe. So, I\u2019m 31, I just turned 31 on January 30th, how about that? Oh, thank you, thank you.\nAnd, when I was approached to do this Ted Talk, I was immediately like: Why? And, then it was kinda like, put in perspective by me, in \u2013 I\u2019m not really one to do speeches, I\u2019m really weird, if you can imagine as I do the performing and I\u2019m on stage, doing this is my job. It\u2019s different to stand up in front of people like this when there\u2019s this light and speak and, you know, express yourself in this way.\nBut, I told myself, okay, how am I gonna be able to do this, let me just talk about my life. That\u2019s something I know, better than anyone else. And, I feel like coming from Cleveland, coming from Shaker, you know, such a diverse place, and just looking in the audience from the people I can\u2019t see, it\u2019s still \u2026 very diverse. But, I believe that my upbringing in this town, the school, district, is what made me the man I am today.\nAnd when I moved away when I was 20 years old, my mom was extremely sad \u2013 where\u2019s my mom at? Yeah. She was crying. Hey Mommy. My first big fan was my mom. And, it was really interesting, I remember leaving home, and she\u2019s giving me a hug at the airport, and she leans and she goes: \u201cYou can always come back around, you can go right back home, you can change your mind, everything will be fine.\u201d I\u2019m like: \u201cNo, I\u2019m going, this is happening.\u201d And you know, walk into security and then looking back and just seeing her like: \u201cOhhh...\u201d And me just being like: \u201cErrr\u2026\u201d\nHowever, as soon as I turned back around, I knew I was on a mission, on this very specific quest. You know? It was bigger than just wanting to be a musician, or do movies. It was about: Finally showing the world what Scott could do. I wasn\u2019t the best student, I\u2019mma be honest with you, Kendra knows this. If Kendra was in my class and she was sitting next to me I probably would have tried to cheat off her.\nBut that\u2019s not the point. The point is, it\u2019s like: When I think about it, you know, I wish I applied myself as much as I applied all the energy into music as I did, as in music as, you know, as in music, I wish I could have applied that same energy into my academics when I was in school. So a lot of people look at me now and they go: \u201cOh man, this must be dope to be a rapper.\u201d And it is dope, it\u2019s awesome. (?)\nBut, you know, I can\u2019t say that I don\u2019t wanna sometimes go back and relearn some things. I can\u2019t say I don\u2019t feel out of certain conversations that my friends have. You know, and these are things that I think about, you know, cause being at school is all about being cool and wearing the fresh \u2013 I was gonna curse but \u2013 wearing fresh clothing. And being popular. And, when you go out into the real world, you realize that that moment is just a little beep of your life. High school, you know. Now I remember Kendra (?), but everything else I don\u2019t remember. No I\u2019m just joking. But I\u2019m just saying: At that moment in life you feel like that\u2019s all that matters. High school, it\u2019s like: Oh this girl doesn\u2019t like me, this guy here and there\u2019s all this drama, this drama, and you go into the real world and you know it\u2019s about just trying to make your mark in the world. And I never got the chance to do that academically.\nSo I had this fire, I had this fire to pursue this musical career. I had no idea how to go about it. I was living with my uncle who was up in the age at the time. 80 years old. Older uncle. So when I moved to New York it\u2019s not he could show me around, show me all the cool spots, you know, he was just kinda like: \u201cThere\u2019s the train and you get a metro card, and you go.\u201d And I was: \u201cYeah okay, we got the Rapid, I can do this. It\u2019s all right.\u201d I was immediately wrong for that, for assuming that it was gonna be the same. It is not the same.\nUm, but, I embraced it. I embraced the fear, the danger. I enjoyed the fact that I was going in uncharted territory. It was like a sense of wonder for me. And, I can\u2019t say I was one of those people that was into like having thrills and, you know, getting some type of stimulation from that, but it was nothing like saying, like: \u201cY\u2019all I\u2019m gonna out and pursue something and I know I\u2019m gonna do it. And nobody\u2019s gonna tell me I can\u2019t. And everybody that doesn\u2019t believe it I\u2019mma prove it to \u2018em sooner or later. And that\u2019s just what it is.\u201d Because I won\u2019t point I didn\u2019t feel like I was smart enough to pass that test. Or I didn\u2019t feel like I was smart enough to go to this college.\nBut with music it was like: Nobody\u2019s gonna take that from me. You know what I\u2019m saying? Because it was things that I was dealing with as a youth at this school that I didn\u2019t talk to people about. That probably kept me from put my best foot forward with my academics. You know? And with music, it was a platform for me to express myself and also realize that I\u2019m not that crazy. That there\u2019s other kids out there that might me depressed or lonely, dealing with suicide, things like this.\nAnd, it was one of those things that, you know, I just feel really blessed to just have my mom who has been my supporter forever, who supplied that trip financially, first couple of months or whatever. Um, to have the support of my home town, I can come back in this room and just feel the love and energy, you guys got me really nervous, my palms are sweaty. But, um, it\u2019s really just the clock, it\u2019s like: 11 minutes, 24 seconds, 23 seconds, 22 seconds \u2026 It\u2019s like what\u2019s gonna happen when that clock\u2019s over with? It\u2019s like somebody gon\u2019 just pull me off stage? Geez.\nUm. But um, really, I, first thing I did when I went to New York, and most people think it was kinda like this amazing adventure \u2013 it wasn\u2019t. It was pretty much finding a job. And for the first couple years I was working everywhere. You know, whether it was like at this clothing store here, or Abercrombie & Fitch, or American Apparel, or Dean & DeLuca, I always had a job. I was a hustler. And, you know, I still apply that same work ethic with the music.\nYou know what I mean, like, I\u2019m almost in a way don\u2019t know how to relax because my whole life has been just a grind. You know what I mean? And, I think that, when people ask me: \u201cMan, how do you do it\u201d, you know, I\u2019m just kinda like: \u201cI don\u2019t know, like I was just \u2026 focused?\u201d You know? Because it\u2019s hard to put it into words because I can\u2019t say that it\u2019s just something I flipped, a switch I just flipped when I turned 20. Like I was always this guy.\nYou know, I was always outspoken and creative and artsy, I used to draw when I was a kid, it was before all the musical stuff came along. I was an artist. You know, I used to draw all my stuff, I used to draw all my tattoos and I said: \u201cOh when I get 18, I\u2019mma draw, I\u2019mma get these tatted.\u201d It was about being a cartoonist up until I was like 15. And then I just wanted to be a rapper. And then it was all uphill from that.\nBut, you know, \u2026 if I could really just give people one piece of advice, you know, and it just passes along, and one thing I want you to take from this, is that like, we are all the commanders of our own destiny.\nYou know what I mean?\nIt\u2019s like you see these movies where they say, like that one movie with \u2026 Lucy, where she has 100 percent of her brain power and she can do anything she wants. You know, and you realize that the average human doesn\u2019t use at \u2026 two, three percent. You know what I mean? Some weird small percentage like that.\nI really just told myself from jump like: \u201cHey man, I\u2019m gonna do this, and I apply the information that I needed to execute that and in places, times of my life where I didn\u2019t have the answers, I make sure to get the information or surround myself with people that had the information.\u201d You know what I mean? You can\u2019t hang out with people that ain\u2019t doing nothing. How you gon\u2019 get money, hanging around with people that ain\u2019t got no money? You know what I\u2019m saying?\nLike, how you gon\u2019 be inspired by people who aren\u2019t at least trying to go the same way, at least, whether it\u2019s music, or schooling, like I would be inspired by all my friends, cause, I went to college, I went to University Toledo for one year for film \u2013 it sucked, I hated it. You know, it wasn\u2019t for me. But my film class, my film classes were amazing, um, and now that I\u2019m doing acting, producing shows, writing shows, I wish I wrote that whole couple, three more years out, cause I would have information that I needed, and I wouldn\u2019t have to go through so many hoops, to be able to direct or create my own film or TV show. Um, I don\u2019t know why I said that, let me get back on track \u2026 Okay.\nSo, um, really, you know, people, like I say, come up to me all the time and they like: \u201cMan but you did it man, you\u2019re special, you\u2019re different\u201d \u2013 and I\u2019m not. Any different. From you, you \u2013 we\u2019re all the same. I came from this town. I went to this school. All my buddies, we all had the same opportunities, you know? It\u2019s kinda just like: Having that self-confidence. You know? And it was a lot of areas in my personality where I wasn\u2019t as confident. You know? Definitely with the chicks. Early on. I don\u2019t know if Kendra knows this.\nBut the music, me doing something, where I was like: \u201cWow, I made this!\u201d Like my first album, when that came out, I was like: \u201cWow! I made this, this is something that I put all my energy into, and it\u2019s out and it\u2019s released to the world on a professional level.\u201d I was so proud of myself. But: \u201cLet\u2019s do it again.\u201d I didn\u2019t have time to be like: \u201cYeah, my first album, yeah, yeah, people like it\u201d, it was like: \u201cOkay, we did good, it didn\u2019t suck, what are we gonna do again, we gotta do another one.\u201d And then I did that one: \u201cOkay, people like it, let\u2019s do a third one.\u201d You can\u2019t get caught up in just all the other things, you know, I really was like, even still to this day, I have my front, but it\u2019s focused, you know, it\u2019s never, you know, even when I do straight, I\u2019m still working. I\u2019m still writing a song, I\u2019m still doing something. I\u2019m persistent.\nYou know, um, and that\u2019s also another part, you know, I believe that some people get lazy. Some people might have that one painting that they started to paint and never finish it. Because they get caught up in their head and it\u2019s: \u201cOh, I can\u2019t do this, maybe I can\u2019t do this.\u201d It\u2019s like sticking to something. One goal at a time. You know, that was like, that\u2019s still big for me. I never put too much on my plate. You know, at first it was like the music, and then the acting kinda came into play, early on, and I, it was unexpected, but it was a blessing, that I was prepared for. I was like: \u201cMan. I\u2019ve been a class clown since forever, let\u2019s do this.\u201d And I used to do it for free, now I\u2019m getting paid for, this is great. Um, so, you know, I\u2019m glad you guys like my jokes, I\u2019m not even a comedian, this is just\u2026\nUm, so, you know, just kinda fast forward cause it\u2019s so much I\u2019m tryna squeeze into 5 minutes, 56 seconds. Um, but, you know man, there are a lot of haters, there are a lot of doubters, there are a lot of people that would telling me: \u201cMan you ain\u2019t gon\u2019 do that.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s not gon\u2019 happen.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019ll be back.\u201d I would tell all my buddies: \u201cI\u2019m moving to New York\u201d \u2013 \u201cAll right! You\u2019ll be back!\u201d Nah. Nah. I\u2019m not coming back. And if I do come back, it\u2019s for a concert. You know? And everybody be like: \u201cAlright, whatever.\u201d\nAnd when I came back it was for a concert. It was for a concert, and it was the most beautiful homecoming I\u2019ve ever had. It\u2019s no show more important than this show. And I\u2019m not just saying that because it was like: In Cleveland, and it\u2019s like, my home town. It was the first time I saw my peers, friends I went to school with, being proud of me. I didn\u2019t get the moment to walk across stage with everybody. I didn\u2019t get the cap and gown. You know what I mean? I didn\u2019t get the chance to see these guys because I moved to Solon, 11th grade. It\u2019s like even seeing Kendra is wild, because I haven\u2019t seen anybody in so long. Um, but, that\u2019s the beautiful moment, still to this day, I do shows and I see a class mate in the crowd and I forget my raps, I\u2019m gonna: \u201cOh \u2026 oh \u2026 happy, you got any kids, I\u2019m sorry, I gotta \u2026\u201d, you know? It\u2019s wild. You know?\nAnd, I didn\u2019t get that at school. I didn\u2019t play on the football team \u2013 I tried, but I was terrible. I didn\u2019t play on the basketball team \u2013 I tried, but I was terrible. I didn\u2019t wrestle. I tried \u2013 no, no. I did try. But I tried outside of the Shaker Heights High School, in another district in Cleveland Heights, where none of my peers could see me and me be embarrassed. It was kinda just like: \u201cOkay I try this in 7th grade and be terrible and then nobody in Shaker will know about it \u2013 cause it\u2019s in Cleveland Heights, they\u2019re just talking over there.\u201d\nBut my point is also like music was my plan G. You know, it wasn\u2019t like I didn\u2019t try anything else, like I tried everything else. I tried everything I thought, you know, was a traditional thing a young boy should do \u2013 sports, you know, and even going to college was me just tryna fulfill a destiny where I thought it was my own destiny, but also I wanted to make my mom happy. You know? And sometimes guys, we gotta do that. You know, there\u2019s a lot of things that we don\u2019t wanna do stuff, but it\u2019s like, man, like, your parents (?), they really have to deal with a lot of our shit. And you know it\u2019s like, and now I\u2019m at 31 and I\u2019m just like: I have to apologize to my mom, was it like seven years ago, I was like: \u201cMom, I am sorry.\u201d Like: \u201cI was a nightmare. But we got money now, so let\u2019s just go like\u2026\u201d And we\u2019re okay. We\u2019re good now.\nUm, and it\u2019s funny, too, cause I took my mom to get her first tattoo ever, I forced her to get a tattoo, and it\u2019s so funny, cause she \u2013 are you, are you embarrassed, I\u2019m sorry. But this is big, you know, because our relationship from the kid I was at high school, it\u2019s the best it\u2019s ever been. You know, I used to put my mom through hell. But, she was my supporter. And that\u2019s what parents are there to do. To give you the devil\u2019s advocate, even when, I\u2019m not gon\u2019 say, every time I told my mom I was moving to New York, she was like: \u201cPff. Okay. Aight.\u201d You know, but that was more so like the fear of letting your child go out into the world, more so like the people in the street that are just hating on you don\u2019t wanna see you win.\nParents care. Now I got a four-and-a-half-year-old, she\u2019ll be five in march. She\u2019s the apple of my eye. She\u2019s my little baby. And, she\u2019s so funny, you know, cause, I\u2019m the one who gets emotional when she has to leave, you know, and I\u2019m kinda just like, when she\u2019s leaving, I\u2019m like: \u201cYou know I\u2019mma miss you, right?\u201d And then she\u2019s like: \u201cYeah.\u201d And I\u2019m like: \u201cYou gon\u2019 miss Daddy?\u201d \u2013 \u201cYeah.\u201d \u201cOh my \u2026 You know you can call me and stuff, when you miss me? And I\u2019m just sad you\u2019re leaving.\u201d She\u2019s like: \u201cIt\u2019s okay. We always come back.\u201d And I was just like: \u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m saying, all that, that\u2019s why I\u2019m crying, I\u2019m so emotional!\u201d But it was just like beautiful to just see, you know like, me be the parent now. You know what I\u2019m saying? And to see that confidence of my child, and the same confidence I gave my mom and you gotta just kinda take it backseat and go: \u201cOkay.\u201d Cause I literally like follow my daughter\u2019s lead. I mean, I just, whatever she is telling me to do, I just follow whatever she \u2013 well I mean, obviously not in every way. Or else like, I would be broke, but \u2026 in some ways I do what she asks me to do or what she tells me to do.\nBut, that\u2019s the beauty of life y\u2019all. You know what I\u2019m saying? I used to come in this room, I used to sit right in that section. Sometimes I\u2019d pay attention \u2013 sometimes I wouldn\u2019t. Most of the time I\u2019d be checking out chicks. Some chick I probably never talk to cause I never had the confidence, maybe if a \u2013 what\u2019s the day that we would send carnations, Kendra? Valentine\u2019s Day. That wasn\u2019t a joke. I was the king of like, sending, like, carnations to chicks that I never talk to. I would be asking my mom for like: \u201cMom, can you give me five bucks, you know it\u2019s (?) today, I wanna (?).\u201d And, she would just be like: \u201cOkay\u201d, you know? Not knowing that I was buying carnations for all these chicks, you know, but, thanks for supplying that, Mom.\nBut, with 23 seconds left. I just what y\u2019all know that life will throw you through shit ton of curve balls, it\u2019s scary, but like, if you believe man. You know? I you believe. And if you want it. And if you wanna work hard enough for it. You can be so. Cause it\u2019s no difference from me and you. I just really wanted this shit. I wanted it bad. You know? And I didn\u2019t want to be a failure. And nobody\u2019s a failure in this room. Don\u2019t ever think that. We can all win. And that\u2019s it.\nThanks.", "image": "https://images.genius.com/e4b6cffbcfbd231e11a0a3d0769476e6.900x900x1.jpg", "artist": "Kid Cudi", "raw": {"annotation_count": 2, "api_path": "/songs/2473463",

Okay. Just wanna check the mic first (?) get the sound right. This is not comedy hour, I promise.\nThe funny thing is: I used to go to this school. And my class used to sit like in this area, here. Yeah, O2, who\u2019s an O2er?\nKendra, come here! Kendra, come on! Kendra (?) everybody! Come, give me a hug! I mean, how long has it been, two decades? Come up here! I was at all doing me. (?). How about that \u2013 reunion!\nOkay. So, it\u2019s just a little surreal, I haven\u2019t been in this room since 1999, 2000 maybe. So, I\u2019m 31, I just turned 31 on January 30th, how about that? Oh, thank you, thank you.\nAnd, when I was approached to do this Ted Talk, I was immediately like: Why? And, then it was kinda like, put in perspective by me, in \u2013 I\u2019m not really one to do speeches, I\u2019m really weird, if you can imagine as I do the performing and I\u2019m on stage, doing this is my job. It\u2019s different to stand up in front of people like this when there\u2019s this light and speak and, you know, express yourself in this way.\nBut, I told myself, okay, how am I gonna be able to do this, let me just talk about my life. That\u2019s something I know, better than anyone else. And, I feel like coming from Cleveland, coming from Shaker, you know, such a diverse place, and just looking in the audience from the people I can\u2019t see, it\u2019s still \u2026 very diverse. But, I believe that my upbringing in this town, the school, district, is what made me the man I am today.\nAnd when I moved away when I was 20 years old, my mom was extremely sad \u2013 where\u2019s my mom at? Yeah. She was crying. Hey Mommy. My first big fan was my mom. And, it was really interesting, I remember leaving home, and she\u2019s giving me a hug at the airport, and she leans and she goes: \u201cYou can always come back around, you can go right back home, you can change your mind, everything will be fine.\u201d I\u2019m like: \u201cNo, I\u2019m going, this is happening.\u201d And you know, walk into security and then looking back and just seeing her like: \u201cOhhh...\u201d And me just being like: \u201cErrr\u2026\u201d\nHowever, as soon as I turned back around, I knew I was on a mission, on this very specific quest. You know? It was bigger than just wanting to be a musician, or do movies. It was about: Finally showing the world what Scott could do. I wasn\u2019t the best student, I\u2019mma be honest with you, Kendra knows this. If Kendra was in my class and she was sitting next to me I probably would have tried to cheat off her.\nBut that\u2019s not the point. The point is, it\u2019s like: When I think about it, you know, I wish I applied myself as much as I applied all the energy into music as I did, as in music as, you know, as in music, I wish I could have applied that same energy into my academics when I was in school. So a lot of people look at me now and they go: \u201cOh man, this must be dope to be a rapper.\u201d And it is dope, it\u2019s awesome. (?)\nBut, you know, I can\u2019t say that I don\u2019t wanna sometimes go back and relearn some things. I can\u2019t say I don\u2019t feel out of certain conversations that my friends have. You know, and these are things that I think about, you know, cause being at school is all about being cool and wearing the fresh \u2013 I was gonna curse but \u2013 wearing fresh clothing. And being popular. And, when you go out into the real world, you realize that that moment is just a little beep of your life. High school, you know. Now I remember Kendra (?), but everything else I don\u2019t remember. No I\u2019m just joking. But I\u2019m just saying: At that moment in life you feel like that\u2019s all that matters. High school, it\u2019s like: Oh this girl doesn\u2019t like me, this guy here and there\u2019s all this drama, this drama, and you go into the real world and you know it\u2019s about just trying to make your mark in the world. And I never got the chance to do that academically.\nSo I had this fire, I had this fire to pursue this musical career. I had no idea how to go about it. I was living with my uncle who was up in the age at the time. 80 years old. Older uncle. So when I moved to New York it\u2019s not he could show me around, show me all the cool spots, you know, he was just kinda like: \u201cThere\u2019s the train and you get a metro card, and you go.\u201d And I was: \u201cYeah okay, we got the Rapid, I can do this. It\u2019s all right.\u201d I was immediately wrong for that, for assuming that it was gonna be the same. It is not the same.\nUm, but, I embraced it. I embraced the fear, the danger. I enjoyed the fact that I was going in uncharted territory. It was like a sense of wonder for me. And, I can\u2019t say I was one of those people that was into like having thrills and, you know, getting some type of stimulation from that, but it was nothing like saying, like: \u201cY\u2019all I\u2019m gonna out and pursue something and I know I\u2019m gonna do it. And nobody\u2019s gonna tell me I can\u2019t. And everybody that doesn\u2019t believe it I\u2019mma prove it to \u2018em sooner or later. And that\u2019s just what it is.\u201d Because I won\u2019t point I didn\u2019t feel like I was smart enough to pass that test. Or I didn\u2019t feel like I was smart enough to go to this college.\nBut with music it was like: Nobody\u2019s gonna take that from me. You know what I\u2019m saying? Because it was things that I was dealing with as a youth at this school that I didn\u2019t talk to people about. That probably kept me from put my best foot forward with my academics. You know? And with music, it was a platform for me to express myself and also realize that I\u2019m not that crazy. That there\u2019s other kids out there that might me depressed or lonely, dealing with suicide, things like this.\nAnd, it was one of those things that, you know, I just feel really blessed to just have my mom who has been my supporter forever, who supplied that trip financially, first couple of months or whatever. Um, to have the support of my home town, I can come back in this room and just feel the love and energy, you guys got me really nervous, my palms are sweaty. But, um, it\u2019s really just the clock, it\u2019s like: 11 minutes, 24 seconds, 23 seconds, 22 seconds \u2026 It\u2019s like what\u2019s gonna happen when that clock\u2019s over with? It\u2019s like somebody gon\u2019 just pull me off stage? Geez.\nUm. But um, really, I, first thing I did when I went to New York, and most people think it was kinda like this amazing adventure \u2013 it wasn\u2019t. It was pretty much finding a job. And for the first couple years I was working everywhere. You know, whether it was like at this clothing store here, or Abercrombie & Fitch, or American Apparel, or Dean & DeLuca, I always had a job. I was a hustler. And, you know, I still apply that same work ethic with the music.\nYou know what I mean, like, I\u2019m almost in a way don\u2019t know how to relax because my whole life has been just a grind. You know what I mean? And, I think that, when people ask me: \u201cMan, how do you do it\u201d, you know, I\u2019m just kinda like: \u201cI don\u2019t know, like I was just \u2026 focused?\u201d You know? Because it\u2019s hard to put it into words because I can\u2019t say that it\u2019s just something I flipped, a switch I just flipped when I turned 20. Like I was always this guy.\nYou know, I was always outspoken and creative and artsy, I used to draw when I was a kid, it was before all the musical stuff came along. I was an artist. You know, I used to draw all my stuff, I used to draw all my tattoos and I said: \u201cOh when I get 18, I\u2019mma draw, I\u2019mma get these tatted.\u201d It was about being a cartoonist up until I was like 15. And then I just wanted to be a rapper. And then it was all uphill from that.\nBut, you know, \u2026 if I could really just give people one piece of advice, you know, and it just passes along, and one thing I want you to take from this, is that like, we are all the commanders of our own destiny.\nYou know what I mean?\nIt\u2019s like you see these movies where they say, like that one movie with \u2026 Lucy, where she has 100 percent of her brain power and she can do anything she wants. You know, and you realize that the average human doesn\u2019t use at \u2026 two, three percent. You know what I mean? Some weird small percentage like that.\nI really just told myself from jump like: \u201cHey man, I\u2019m gonna do this, and I apply the information that I needed to execute that and in places, times of my life where I didn\u2019t have the answers, I make sure to get the information or surround myself with people that had the information.\u201d You know what I mean? You can\u2019t hang out with people that ain\u2019t doing nothing. How you gon\u2019 get money, hanging around with people that ain\u2019t got no money? You know what I\u2019m saying?\nLike, how you gon\u2019 be inspired by people who aren\u2019t at least trying to go the same way, at least, whether it\u2019s music, or schooling, like I would be inspired by all my friends, cause, I went to college, I went to University Toledo for one year for film \u2013 it sucked, I hated it. You know, it wasn\u2019t for me. But my film class, my film classes were amazing, um, and now that I\u2019m doing acting, producing shows, writing shows, I wish I wrote that whole couple, three more years out, cause I would have information that I needed, and I wouldn\u2019t have to go through so many hoops, to be able to direct or create my own film or TV show. Um, I don\u2019t know why I said that, let me get back on track \u2026 Okay.\nSo, um, really, you know, people, like I say, come up to me all the time and they like: \u201cMan but you did it man, you\u2019re special, you\u2019re different\u201d \u2013 and I\u2019m not. Any different. From you, you \u2013 we\u2019re all the same. I came from this town. I went to this school. All my buddies, we all had the same opportunities, you know? It\u2019s kinda just like: Having that self-confidence. You know? And it was a lot of areas in my personality where I wasn\u2019t as confident. You know? Definitely with the chicks. Early on. I don\u2019t know if Kendra knows this.\nBut the music, me doing something, where I was like: \u201cWow, I made this!\u201d Like my first album, when that came out, I was like: \u201cWow! I made this, this is something that I put all my energy into, and it\u2019s out and it\u2019s released to the world on a professional level.\u201d I was so proud of myself. But: \u201cLet\u2019s do it again.\u201d I didn\u2019t have time to be like: \u201cYeah, my first album, yeah, yeah, people like it\u201d, it was like: \u201cOkay, we did good, it didn\u2019t suck, what are we gonna do again, we gotta do another one.\u201d And then I did that one: \u201cOkay, people like it, let\u2019s do a third one.\u201d You can\u2019t get caught up in just all the other things, you know, I really was like, even still to this day, I have my front, but it\u2019s focused, you know, it\u2019s never, you know, even when I do straight, I\u2019m still working. I\u2019m still writing a song, I\u2019m still doing something. I\u2019m persistent.\nYou know, um, and that\u2019s also another part, you know, I believe that some people get lazy. Some people might have that one painting that they started to paint and never finish it. Because they get caught up in their head and it\u2019s: \u201cOh, I can\u2019t do this, maybe I can\u2019t do this.\u201d It\u2019s like sticking to something. One goal at a time. You know, that was like, that\u2019s still big for me. I never put too much on my plate. You know, at first it was like the music, and then the acting kinda came into play, early on, and I, it was unexpected, but it was a blessing, that I was prepared for. I was like: \u201cMan. I\u2019ve been a class clown since forever, let\u2019s do this.\u201d And I used to do it for free, now I\u2019m getting paid for, this is great. Um, so, you know, I\u2019m glad you guys like my jokes, I\u2019m not even a comedian, this is just\u2026\nUm, so, you know, just kinda fast forward cause it\u2019s so much I\u2019m tryna squeeze into 5 minutes, 56 seconds. Um, but, you know man, there are a lot of haters, there are a lot of doubters, there are a lot of people that would telling me: \u201cMan you ain\u2019t gon\u2019 do that.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s not gon\u2019 happen.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019ll be back.\u201d I would tell all my buddies: \u201cI\u2019m moving to New York\u201d \u2013 \u201cAll right! You\u2019ll be back!\u201d Nah. Nah. I\u2019m not coming back. And if I do come back, it\u2019s for a concert. You know? And everybody be like: \u201cAlright, whatever.\u201d\nAnd when I came back it was for a concert. It was for a concert, and it was the most beautiful homecoming I\u2019ve ever had. It\u2019s no show more important than this show. And I\u2019m not just saying that because it was like: In Cleveland, and it\u2019s like, my home town. It was the first time I saw my peers, friends I went to school with, being proud of me. I didn\u2019t get the moment to walk across stage with everybody. I didn\u2019t get the cap and gown. You know what I mean? I didn\u2019t get the chance to see these guys because I moved to Solon, 11th grade. It\u2019s like even seeing Kendra is wild, because I haven\u2019t seen anybody in so long. Um, but, that\u2019s the beautiful moment, still to this day, I do shows and I see a class mate in the crowd and I forget my raps, I\u2019m gonna: \u201cOh \u2026 oh \u2026 happy, you got any kids, I\u2019m sorry, I gotta \u2026\u201d, you know? It\u2019s wild. You know?\nAnd, I didn\u2019t get that at school. I didn\u2019t play on the football team \u2013 I tried, but I was terrible. I didn\u2019t play on the basketball team \u2013 I tried, but I was terrible. I didn\u2019t wrestle. I tried \u2013 no, no. I did try. But I tried outside of the Shaker Heights High School, in another district in Cleveland Heights, where none of my peers could see me and me be embarrassed. It was kinda just like: \u201cOkay I try this in 7th grade and be terrible and then nobody in Shaker will know about it \u2013 cause it\u2019s in Cleveland Heights, they\u2019re just talking over there.\u201d\nBut my point is also like music was my plan G. You know, it wasn\u2019t like I didn\u2019t try anything else, like I tried everything else. I tried everything I thought, you know, was a traditional thing a young boy should do \u2013 sports, you know, and even going to college was me just tryna fulfill a destiny where I thought it was my own destiny, but also I wanted to make my mom happy. You know? And sometimes guys, we gotta do that. You know, there\u2019s a lot of things that we don\u2019t wanna do stuff, but it\u2019s like, man, like, your parents (?), they really have to deal with a lot of our shit. And you know it\u2019s like, and now I\u2019m at 31 and I\u2019m just like: I have to apologize to my mom, was it like seven years ago, I was like: \u201cMom, I am sorry.\u201d Like: \u201cI was a nightmare. But we got money now, so let\u2019s just go like\u2026\u201d And we\u2019re okay. We\u2019re good now.\nUm, and it\u2019s funny, too, cause I took my mom to get her first tattoo ever, I forced her to get a tattoo, and it\u2019s so funny, cause she \u2013 are you, are you embarrassed, I\u2019m sorry. But this is big, you know, because our relationship from the kid I was at high school, it\u2019s the best it\u2019s ever been. You know, I used to put my mom through hell. But, she was my supporter. And that\u2019s what parents are there to do. To give you the devil\u2019s advocate, even when, I\u2019m not gon\u2019 say, every time I told my mom I was moving to New York, she was like: \u201cPff. Okay. Aight.\u201d You know, but that was more so like the fear of letting your child go out into the world, more so like the people in the street that are just hating on you don\u2019t wanna see you win.\nParents care. Now I got a four-and-a-half-year-old, she\u2019ll be five in march. She\u2019s the apple of my eye. She\u2019s my little baby. And, she\u2019s so funny, you know, cause, I\u2019m the one who gets emotional when she has to leave, you know, and I\u2019m kinda just like, when she\u2019s leaving, I\u2019m like: \u201cYou know I\u2019mma miss you, right?\u201d And then she\u2019s like: \u201cYeah.\u201d And I\u2019m like: \u201cYou gon\u2019 miss Daddy?\u201d \u2013 \u201cYeah.\u201d \u201cOh my \u2026 You know you can call me and stuff, when you miss me? And I\u2019m just sad you\u2019re leaving.\u201d She\u2019s like: \u201cIt\u2019s okay. We always come back.\u201d And I was just like: \u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m saying, all that, that\u2019s why I\u2019m crying, I\u2019m so emotional!\u201d But it was just like beautiful to just see, you know like, me be the parent now. You know what I\u2019m saying? And to see that confidence of my child, and the same confidence I gave my mom and you gotta just kinda take it backseat and go: \u201cOkay.\u201d Cause I literally like follow my daughter\u2019s lead. I mean, I just, whatever she is telling me to do, I just follow whatever she \u2013 well I mean, obviously not in every way. Or else like, I would be broke, but \u2026 in some ways I do what she asks me to do or what she tells me to do.\nBut, that\u2019s the beauty of life y\u2019all. You know what I\u2019m saying? I used to come in this room, I used to sit right in that section. Sometimes I\u2019d pay attention \u2013 sometimes I wouldn\u2019t. Most of the time I\u2019d be checking out chicks. Some chick I probably never talk to cause I never had the confidence, maybe if a \u2013 what\u2019s the day that we would send carnations, Kendra? Valentine\u2019s Day. That wasn\u2019t a joke. I was the king of like, sending, like, carnations to chicks that I never talk to. I would be asking my mom for like: \u201cMom, can you give me five bucks, you know it\u2019s (?) today, I wanna (?).\u201d And, she would just be like: \u201cOkay\u201d, you know? Not knowing that I was buying carnations for all these chicks, you know, but, thanks for supplying that, Mom.\nBut, with 23 seconds left. I just what y\u2019all know that life will throw you through shit ton of curve balls, it\u2019s scary, but like, if you believe man. You know? I you believe. And if you want it. And if you wanna work hard enough for it. You can be so. Cause it\u2019s no difference from me and you. I just really wanted this shit. I wanted it bad. You know? And I didn\u2019t want to be a failure. And nobody\u2019s a failure in this room. Don\u2019t ever think that. We can all win. And that\u2019s it.\nThanks."}}, {"title": "Hyyerr", "album": "Man on the Moon: The End of Day", "year": "2009-09-15", "lyrics": "Easy, ahh\nThis is Easy Sunday Morning\nAnd we're right here on a beautiful morning\nIn Cleveland, Ohio, and it's chilly today\nThe kids are going to school, the grass is frosty\n(This should be my) Let's take it on, on the ride-ide out\n(Theme song) In the morning\n(To life) Hello Cleveland\n(Hahah) Yeah\n\nA nigga like me be so gone\nEyes so low that a nigga gotta throw his locs on\n\"Wonder what them folks on?\" That's what they be askin'\nDumb kush we smokes on, smell it when a nigga passin'\nWe gettin' to the cash, and you can see a nigga shinin'\nJust a little gold, a couple hoes, couple, two, three diamonds\nUp in the hood where you find him, unless he out on the road\nEvery show got a bag full of blow and Patron\nAll my niggas getting throwed like they 'posed to\nCause life is short and filled with lots of grief and doubt\nSo I just pull that bag of colorful frosty leaves on out\nAnd free my scalp, I need to free my mind a puff at a time\nI'm up all the time, I'm up on the grind\nSo a Red Bull and a blunt would be fine\nJust wanna feel fine, just wanna kill time\nJust wanna relax and think of a rhyme\nDon't really like sippin' cause I get to trippin'\nMy nigga, just roll up a heap of that pine\nAnd only bring a little bit for the trip\nJust in case we get blurped by 5-0\n\"Sir, you look high\", I know, but I prefer my eyes low\n\nAnd we get higher, and higher\nAnd higher, and higher\nAnd we get higher, and higher\nAnd higher, and higher\nYou know we get higher, and higher\nAnd higher, and higher\nYou know we get higher, so higher\nOh-oh-oh, oh yeah, we get so high\n\nYeah, they say, \"Easy friend\nThere he go talking about weed again\nProbably cause of all that weed in him\", yes and no\nCause and effect is what most don't know\nDoing bad or like Mike said could be doing wrong\nForget about the obvious context of song\nPut your brain where it belong\nCan't we just all get a bong and tag along?\nAnd we float, we kids with hope\nBetter to cope when you smoke\nDawg, please don't miss\nWhat a nigga tryna get you thinking 'bout\nWe outside because my mama in the house\nPuff puff pass with your bitch ass\nBack in high school, smoked weed when I cut class\nAnd now I'm an addict, tragic\nStay rolling up while reclining\nI be looking down, see my Jesus piece shining\nGood look Yeezy, now I stay blinded by that light\nSomebody pass me that shell to the right\nYes, I'm going, I'll be outtie, and you can find me\nI'll be chilling back, I'll be chilling Jack\nLet's go\n\nAnd we get higher, and higher\nAnd higher, and higher\nAnd we get higher, and higher\nAnd higher, and higher\nYou know we get higher, and higher\nAnd higher, and higher\nYou know we get higher, so higher\nOh-oh-oh, oh yeah, we get so high", "image": "https://images.genius.com/efc07c09f2ac2b595d950ffcf79a1a73.1000x1000x1.jpg", "artist": "Kid Cudi", "raw": {"annotation_count": 37, "api_path": "/songs/2329", "description": {"dom": {"tag": "root", "children": [{"tag": "p", "children": ["Just a song about smoking marijuana.

morning\nIn Cleveland, Ohio, and it's chilly today\nThe kids are going to school, the grass is frosty\n(This should be my) Let's take it on, on the ride-ide out\n(Theme song) In the morning\n(To life) Hello Cleveland\n(Hahah) Yeah\n\nA nigga like me be so gone\nEyes so low that a nigga gotta throw his locs on\n\"Wonder what them folks on?\" That's what they be askin'\nDumb kush we smokes on, smell it when a nigga passin'\nWe gettin' to the cash, and you can see a nigga shinin'\nJust a little gold, a couple hoes, couple, two, three diamonds\nUp in the hood where you find him, unless he out on the road\nEvery show got a bag full of blow and Patron\nAll my niggas getting throwed like they 'posed to\nCause life is short and filled with lots of grief and doubt\nSo I just pull that bag of colorful frosty leaves on out\nAnd free my scalp, I need to free my mind a puff at a time\nI'm up all the time, I'm up on the grind\nSo a Red Bull and a blunt would be fine\nJust wanna feel fine, just wanna kill time\nJust wanna relax and think of a rhyme\nDon't really like sippin' cause I get to trippin'\nMy nigga, just roll up a heap of that pine\nAnd only bring a little bit for the trip\nJust in case we get blurped by 5-0\n\"Sir, you look high\", I know, but I prefer my eyes low\n\nAnd we get higher, and higher\nAnd higher, and higher\nAnd we get higher, and higher\nAnd higher, and higher\nYou know we get higher, and higher\nAnd higher, and higher\nYou know we get higher, so higher\nOh-oh-oh, oh yeah, we get so high\n\nYeah, they say, \"Easy friend\nThere he go talking about weed again\nProbably cause of all that weed in him\", yes and no\nCause and effect is what most don't know\nDoing bad or like Mike said could be doing wrong\nForget about the obvious context of song\nPut your brain where it belong\nCan't we just all get a bong and tag along?\nAnd we float, we kids with hope\nBetter to cope when you smoke\nDawg, please don't miss\nWhat a nigga tryna get you thinking 'bout\nWe outside because my mama in the house\nPuff puff pass with your bitch ass\nBack in high school, smoked weed when I cut class\nAnd now I'm an addict, tragic\nStay rolling up while reclining\nI be looking down, see my Jesus piece shining\nGood look Yeezy, now I stay blinded by that light\nSomebody pass me that shell to the right\nYes, I'm going, I'll be outtie, and you can find me\nI'll be chilling back, I'll be chilling Jack\nLet's go\n\nAnd we get higher, and higher\nAnd higher, and higher\nAnd we get higher, and higher\nAnd higher, and higher\nYou know we get higher, and

couldn't speak anything of real hope\nAnd the day came when it hit me like lightning through my veins\nA sudden change in my groove, in my walk (hmmm)\nI got my lion heart and electric flowing through my brain\nShocking waves make me feel I can float\nIt's like the city is mine and the dark is my cape\nI can't explain this sudden peace in my walk, I sure hope\n\nI'm living my life as if I got powers\nAnd tonight I feel immortal\nI said tonight I feel immortal\nTonight I feel immortal\nHmmm hmmm, hmmm hmmm, hmmm hmmm\nHmmm hmmm, hmmm hmmm, hmmm hmmm\n\nBet you want to see me weak\nNot sort of my thing you see\nI'm too damn cool, my mojo too dope\nIt's the same old thing getting lost Day N' Nite, young and lost in the pain\nSo many times I've broke this vicious cycle\nI got my lion heart and electric flowing through my brain\nShocking waves make me feel I can float\nSurely I'mma do what I want, ain't got no one to blame\nI can't explain this sudden peace in my walk, I sure hope\n\nI'm living my life as if I got powers\nAnd tonight I feel immortal\nI said tonight I feel immortal\nTonight I feel immortal\nHmmm hmmm, hmmm hmmm, hmmm hmmm\nHmmm hmmm, hmmm hmmm, hmmm hmmm\nI'm living my

that I had powers\nAnd nobody wanted to believe me\nAll right\n\n\nSpent the last month feeling bad 'bout myself\nI couldn't speak anything of real hope\nAnd the day came when it hit me like lightning through my veins\nA sudden change in my groove, in my walk (hmmm)\nI got my lion heart and electric flowing through my brain\nShocking waves make me feel I can float\nIt's like the city is mine and the dark is my cape\nI can't explain this sudden peace in my walk, I sure hope\n\nI'm living my life as if I got powers\nAnd tonight I feel immortal\nI said tonight I feel immortal\nTonight I feel immortal\nHmmm hmmm, hmmm hmmm, hmmm hmmm\nHmmm hmmm, hmmm hmmm, hmmm hmmm\n\nBet you want to see me weak\nNot sort of my thing you see\nI'm too damn cool, my mojo too dope\nIt's the same old thing getting lost Day N' Nite, young and lost in the pain\nSo many times I've broke this vicious cycle\nI got my lion heart and electric flowing through my brain\nShocking waves make me feel I can float\nSurely I'mma do what I want, ain't got no one to blame\nI can't explain this sudden peace in my walk, I sure hope\n\nI'm living my life as if I got powers\nAnd tonight I feel immortal\nI said

on the beat\nYeah\nLet's go\nLet's beat this motherfucker\n\nCudi in the spot, all the lames ice-grillin'\nMad cause their girl call me Mr. Nice-feelin'\nMust stay clear from the sneaks to the fade\nI ain't even in the game and the nigga look paid\nCockroach niggas get sprayed with the Raid\nNo time for the drama, tryna get laid\nSippin', my mellow, Kid Mesc lady killer\nYo girl, I'm a fill her like gas to the tank\nNice skin, college girl, wanna come to Scotty's world\nLike to wear it straight, wanna cut her hair like \nI wanna pop, but you're a bad bitch\nSays she a magician, wanna show me tricks\nTold her I'm a beast in the sheets and the booth\nSays she ain't believe me, need to see some proof\nPulled out my demo, then pulled out a condom\nTold her let's go, while we listen to my album\n\nI'm that boy\nI'm that\nNiggas need to know\nI spit high, high\nI'm that boy\nI'm that\nNiggas need to know\nI spit high, high\n\nMet a older ho, birth name \n this nigga had a dealer\nAll the motherfuckers run game just to keep it\nBut the bitch \nYa boy had to delete it\nI said: These are the things I'm on\nNiggas see the potential, wreck shit King Kong\nBeat bot tiller, he a beat Godzilla\nI'm that nigga, boy boy, told you before\nScrewed up shit in the deck and move slow\nGot a neck from a chick and neck move slow\nPerform on stage, hoes in the front row\nThey try to take that like i was Sean Combs\nBitch get down\nYou need to go home or you get dick down\nI use slump, let the base line thump\nAnd it bumps and it thumps that all the cops get mad\nI chill cause I'm ill, up in the game all smacks\nThe races for cake, doing a hundred meters dash\nSit back and I laugh, cause these others are jokes\nThey might just get slapped and those will get choked\n\nI'm that boy\nI'm that\nNiggas need to know\nI spit high, high\nI'm that boy\nI'm that\nNiggas need to know\nI spit high, high"}}, {"title": "Indicud [Album Art + Tracklist]", "album": "Indicud", "year":

here in my dreams\nEverything is A-okay\nI don't worry 'bout anything\nCause every day, every day, every day is sunny\nHere in my dreams, now\nWelcome\nYeah\nWelcome\nYou're in my dreams\nThis is\nA dream come true\nFinding the perfect words to sing to you\nHere in my dreams\nEverything plays out\nExactly how I want them to\nEverything turns out dope\nRight here in my dreams\nWelcome\nYeah\nWelcome\nYou're in my dreams, nahh\n\nLong before we know ourselves, our paths are already set in stone\nSome may never figure out their purpose in life and some will\nThere are a lot of us who are caught up in this hell we all live in\nContent with being blinded by rules and judgment\nWe live in a world where it's more okay to follow than to lead\nIn this world being a leader is trouble for the system we are all accustomed to\nBeing a leader in this day and age is being a threat\nNot many people stood up against the system we all call life\nBut toward the end of our first ten years into the millennium we heard a voice\nA voice who was speaking to us from the underground for some time\nA voice who spoke of vulnerabilities and other human emotions and issues never before heard so vividly and honest\nThis is the story of a young man who not only believed in himself, but his dreams too\nThis is the story of the Man On The Moon", "image":

everything I ever needed\nRight here in my dreams\nEverything is A-okay\nI don't worry 'bout anything\nCause every day, every day, every day is sunny\nHere in my dreams, now\nWelcome\nYeah\nWelcome\nYou're in my dreams\nThis is\nA dream come true\nFinding the perfect words to sing to you\nHere in my dreams\nEverything plays out\nExactly how I want them to\nEverything turns out dope\nRight here in my dreams\nWelcome\nYeah\nWelcome\nYou're in my dreams, nahh\n\nLong before we know ourselves, our paths are already set in stone\nSome may never figure out their purpose in life and some will\nThere are a lot of us who are caught up in this hell we all live in\nContent with being blinded by rules and judgment\nWe live in a world where it's more okay to follow than to lead\nIn this world being a leader is trouble for the system we are all accustomed to\nBeing a leader in this day and age is being a threat\nNot many people stood up against the system we all call life\nBut toward the end of our first ten years into the millennium we heard a voice\nA voice who was speaking to us from the underground for some time\nA voice who spoke of vulnerabilities and other human emotions and issues never before heard so vividly and honest\nThis is the story of a young man who not only believed in himself, but his dreams too\nThis is the story of the Man On The Moon"}},

don't understand it\nSome people fake\nAnd some of them underhanded\nSome underrated\nMost of them stranded\nI wish life had a guide and came with a pamphlet\nTo show me where to go\nAnd the things that is tragic\nWho really knows what you doing everyday\nAnd if you made the wrong moves that lead to your fate\nAnd tell me about them asses\nAnd how we eat in classes\nThe first time offenders\nThat's never given chances\nAnd the people need justice\nThe one's living honest\nWe go ? man\nAnd they ever take my life man\nI give you the promise\nI did it for the love\nNever for the dollars\nStay based for life\nAnd minimize the losses\nI realize that I'm a living prophet\nWe are gods\n\nI hear them calling me\nWill I answer, answer\nI see them chasing me\nWill I run from them,

them\nI hear them calling me\nWill I answer, answer\nI see them chasing me\nWill I run from them, run from them\nVerse 2 Lil B:\nI still so based\nAnd people still in panic\nWhat going on\nI just don't understand it\nSome people fake\nAnd some of them underhanded\nSome underrated\nMost of them stranded\nI wish life had a guide and came with a pamphlet\nTo show me where to go\nAnd the things that is tragic\nWho really knows what you doing everyday\nAnd if you made the wrong moves that lead to your fate\nAnd tell me about them asses\nAnd how we eat in classes\nThe first time offenders\nThat's never given chances\nAnd the people need justice\nThe one's living honest\nWe go ? man\nAnd they ever take my life man\nI give you the promise\nI did it for the love\nNever for the dollars\nStay based for life\nAnd minimize the losses\nI realize that I'm a living prophet\nWe are gods\n\nI hear them calling me\nWill I answer, answer\nI see them chasing me\nWill I run from them, run from them\nI hear them calling me\nWill I answer, answer\nI see them chasing me\nWill I run from them, run from them"}}, {"title": "Is There Any Love?", "album": "A Kid Named Cudi", "year":

a slave who imagined being free\nAnd made it all happen for his family and his seed\nAnd now me, you can call me Mr. Friendly\nOne life to live, but no acting on my nigga Friendy\nCan't stand evil bitches with they Fendi\nAll they do is envy and plot up on my loins\nI give you options baby flip a coin\nYou get McDonald's, forget the sirloin\nHating my macking, they asking\n\nIs there any love\nIn this world?\nIs there any love\nIn this world?\nIs there any love\nIn this world of ours?\nIs there any love\nIn this world?\n\nFolarin, the muse of the hater\nThat music is greater, stupid nigga, bring your face up\nBamas surprised, deprived from attention\nPride of the district all rise so they listenin'\nFrom where gorillas territorial for inches\nWhen it come to pistols, these niggas don't John Lynch them\nOff rip that's genius\nYou niggas so-so like seamstress\nNo more amore, I refuse to force you\nMaybe I lack the fortitude to try to court you\nOf course, they all hate\nEarly

Cleveland were plain dealers, uh\nWho whipped Supremes, the candy-painted eyes\nBut the love from the boppers had 'him watchin they rise\nWasn't no love for a nigga in the smug\nSipping out a cup, a concoction for cruising\nHigh off life? My nigga not even\nI'mma go to war with the devil 'til we're even\nBobbing and weaving, spiritual hymn singing\nNo commentary my man, I come out swinging\nAnd this will be the song that we sing\nAny young nigga with visions when he's sleeping", "image": "https://images.genius.com/4fb504d5b4dda8a236c224bb1cc11e2a.800x800x1.jpg", "artist": "Kid Cudi", "raw": {"annotation_count": 20, "api_path": "/songs/2086", "description": {"dom": {"tag": "root", "children": [{"tag": "p", "children": ["Famous for being featured in the 2011 Danny McBride movie \u201c30 Minutes or Less\u201d, this song is from Kid Cudi\u2019s 2008 Mixtape, ", {"tag": "em", "children": ["A Kid Named Cudi"]}, ".

tryin' to get me some, bad bitches wanna get me sprung\nEarly in the morning, I'm wakin' bakin', drinkin', contemplatin'\nAin't no such thing as Satan, evil is what you make it\nThank the Lord for that burning bush, that big body Benz I was born to push\nOn my way I'm burning kush, nigga don't be worried 'bout us\nNeighbors knockin' on the door, asking can we turn it down\nI say, \"Ain't no music on\" she said, \"Naw, that weed is loud\"\nNigga, we ballin', straight swaggin', lost Hawk, but I'm maintainin'\nI've been told that I'm amazing, make sure keep that fire blazin', we livin'\n\nI need smoke\nI need to smoke\nWho gon' hold me down now?\nI wanna get high y'all\nI wanna get high y'all\nNeed it need it to get by y'all\nCan you get me high y'all?\nI wanna get high y'all\nI wanna get high y'all\nNeed it need it to get by y'all\nCan you get me high y'all?\n\nI'm just what you made God, just what you made God (Nee-need it)\nI'm just what you made God, I'm just what you made\n(Nee-need it) I'm just what you made God\nI'm just what you made God, I'm just what you made God\n\nLet me tell you \u2018bout my month y'all, in the shop and I had a ball\nI had to ball for therapy, my shrink don\u2019t think that helps at all\nWhatever, that man ain\u2019t wearing these leather pants\nI diagnose my damn self, these damn pills ain\u2019t working fam\nIn my spare time, punching walls, fucking up my hand\nI know that shit sound super cray but if you had my life you\u2019d understand\nBut, I can\u2019t fold, some poor soul got it way worse\nWe\u2019re all troubled, in a world of trouble\nIt\u2019s scary to have a kid walk this Earth\nI\u2019m what you made God, fuck yes I\u2019m so odd\nThinking 'bout all my old friends who weren\u2019t my friends all along\nHm, when it rains it pours, whiskey bottles on the sinks and floors\nEveryday to find sane\u2019s a chore, amidst a dream with no exit doors\n\nI need smoke\nI need to smoke\nWho gon' hold me down now?\nI wanna get high y'all\nI wanna get high y'all\nNeed it need it to get by y'all\nCan you get me high y'all?\nI wanna get high y'all\nI wanna get high y'all\nNeed it need it to get by y'all\nCan you get me high y'all?\n\nI'm just what you made God, just what you made God (Nee-need it)\nI'm just what you made God, I'm just what you made\n(Nee-need it) I'm just what you made God\nI'm just what you made

never take me alive\nKing Wizard!\n\nYou love that little bit of new, now throwback\nCleveland City snakeskin snapback\nNiggas know the uniform, keep the brim low\nYou doubt him, don't know a damn thing about him\nWhat is hip hop without him, y'all niggas just really don't know\nGo, all day every day, hold on with all might\nI gave the world my heart and they gave the kids insight\nYup now fuck you I ain't left\nI'm outta my mind like all the time\nAnd a nigga ain't missed one step (yet, yup)\n\nI can\u2019t decide\nWhat if life\u2019s a lie?\nI push the lames aside\nThey\u2019ll learn\nI

tell a nigga nothing, man I wish you would\nNiggas ain't working, like me I had to put my bid in\nAll this rose gold I'm dipped in\nJuste un clou, while I coast through clouds\nThat's my life babe, crystal clear, no cascade\nI'm going, going I'm on a crusade\nTo save the kids from the weak shit\nIt's finally gonna be my world\nHere all the girls can be my girls\nJust sit back count stacks girl\nHold a nigga down all the time girl\n\nI can\u2019t decide\nWhat if life\u2019s a lie?\nI push the lames aside\nThey\u2019ll learn\nI can never front, know why?\nIt\u2019s not my style, no

lames aside\nThey\u2019ll learn\nI can never front, know why?\nIt\u2019s not my style, no lie\nFuck all the talk\nIn time, they\u2019ll burn\nI can\u2019t decide\nWhat if life\u2019s a lie?\nI push the lames aside\nThey\u2019ll learn\nI can never front, know why?\nIts not my style, no lie\nThey\u2019ll never take me alive\nKing Wizard!\n\nYou love that little bit of new, now throwback\nCleveland City snakeskin snapback\nNiggas know the uniform, keep the brim low\nYou doubt him, don't know a damn thing about him\nWhat is hip hop without him, y'all niggas just really don't know\nGo, all day every day, hold on with all might\nI gave the world my heart and they gave the kids insight\nYup now fuck you I ain't left\nI'm outta my mind like all the time\nAnd a nigga ain't missed one step (yet, yup)\n\nI can\u2019t decide\nWhat if life\u2019s a lie?\nI push the lames aside\nThey\u2019ll learn\nI can never front, know why?\nIt\u2019s not my style, no lie\nFuck all the talk\nIn time,

alive\nKing Wizard!\n\nMy head hurt, gotta give me something that'll make me feel good\nI remember couldn't tell a nigga nothing, man I wish you would\nNiggas ain't working, like me I had to put my bid in\nAll this rose gold I'm dipped in\nJuste un clou, while I coast through clouds\nThat's my life babe, crystal clear, no cascade\nI'm going, going I'm on a crusade\nTo save the kids from the weak shit\nIt's finally gonna be my world\nHere all the girls can be my girls\nJust sit back count stacks girl\nHold a nigga down all the time girl\n\nI can\u2019t decide\nWhat if life\u2019s a lie?\nI

far\nAll he needed was some rockets on the side of a car\nMaybe a little weed to intensify the scene\nTo provide a solid answer to the question \u201cwhy I lean?\u2019\nA bonafide fiend that be taking by the beams of light\nMan on the moon ain\u2019t a name it\u2019s a way of life\nAnd it\u2019s a swag I hated\nUntil I found myself and embraced it\nIts something I denied\nWhy lie to my soul\nTruth be told\u2026\n\nOh no\nI thought my mind was capped\nUntil I open my eyes\nAnd see what finally happened for me\nI know you made me different for a reason god\nI think I know why (why)\nI know you put me to it for a reason god\nI think I know why (why)\nOh no\nThese niggas thought I was capped\nUntil they open their eyes\nAnd see what finally happen for me\nI know you made me different for a

scenes\nWhile them other niggas ride watching screens\nI was getting off of work daydreaming all alone\nDaydream till I\u2019m home\nIn my bed in my zone\nNobody would call\nNot a ring on my phone\nRaps so boring\nI can\u2019t buy ringtones\nI\u2019d rather have the Nokia alert\nI\u2019m so gone\nMan I\u2019m never alert\nBut I feel so good\nNo more hurt\nI\u2019m whole completely

leave her\nMy life is much bigger\nThe plan I mean\nIts all set in motion, the plan I\u2019ve seen\nCouldn\u2019t figure out my purpose till the sky changed scenes\nWhile them other niggas ride watching screens\nI was getting off of work daydreaming all alone\nDaydream till I\u2019m home\nIn my bed in my zone\nNobody would call\nNot a ring on my phone\nRaps so boring\nI can\u2019t buy ringtones\nI\u2019d rather have the Nokia alert\nI\u2019m so gone\nMan I\u2019m never alert\nBut I feel so good\nNo more hurt\nI\u2019m whole completely complete\nRainy days completely delete\nI see\u2026\n\nOh no\nI thought my mind was capped\nUntil I open my eyes\nAnd see what finally happened for me\nI know you made me different for a reason god\nI think I know why (why)\nI know you put me

Ruin niggas hopes of success\nAfter LeBron, I'm what's next\n\nLook up at da stars (3x)\n\nNow I'm back on my grizzle, A plethora of strippers\nI'm throwin around broads playing monkey in the middle\nI'm curious Jorge, Fuck what dem whores say\nMost of them is faker than the horse hair they forced in\nI be in the club looking for a couple more of dem\nSorta like my first date.

No big chains\nJust Plain Pat visions with some sick aim\nCool Beans though, 10 Deep Jeans ho\nStampede fitted in the range with a knitted\nNo gimmick: Real time, Real heart\nReal words...Elegant: A piece of art\nNo famous name vouch and I'm still the shit\nNigga first couple songs, no guest appearances\nNow you sick, mayne. I ain't takin stabs\nI'm just taking names, then I'm kickin' ass\nI'll never be retro like a Cool Kid\nWith only two songs, look at what I did\nMe and my nigga Wale let them suckas pass\nTill we fed up and wet up Where niggas keep they swag\nTo the 'R'. Ruin niggas hopes of success\nAfter LeBron, I'm what's next\n\nLook up at da stars (3x)\n\nNow I'm back on my grizzle, A plethora of strippers\nI'm throwin around broads playing monkey in the middle\nI'm curious Jorge, Fuck what dem whores say\nMost of them is faker than the horse hair they forced in\nI be in the club looking for a couple more of dem\nSorta like my first date. Fresher by the hullin'\nI don't need your girl. Man I got a lot\nThey say he got a lot of whips, well I got A LOT\nYou can't unwind it. Rising and climbing\nAin't nobody brighter...

the dick, gold on the ring finger\nNot the one to play dumb, see I'm from Cleveland bitch\nI'm up in the hills still keep it way triller than most\nWanna relax, someone tell me how that feels\nI say that now until I go an pop this pill\nI say out loud 'you wanna let me cop a feel?'\nNow I don't pray out loud but I know my god heals\nBounce with me If you dont give a fuck simply\nFed up won't let up on the overtime\nThe more I work, the more they wanna sweat mine\nI can feel those lames they love to speak my name\nSometimes dreams of breakin niggas whole faces\nIn front of the precinct, ain't scared of catchin\u2019 cases\nSky might fall, but I ain't worried at all\nGot me some xannies and a couple adderall\nPlus these racks we distribute at the mall\nWith the spirit of god and some Gandalf balls, yahm!\nLord of the sad and lonely\nAnd the ones that feel like shit on the daily\nDont let these phony niggas and hoes\nBe the ones that bring you low\nLet it be from the fatigue from making a pussy bleed\nAll of the things I've seen and survived\nMake a nigga feel way more than just alive\nYou know my name you know my face\nAll hail King Wizard in your motherfucking space\nYou love it\n\nYep, yep, yep\nLord of the sad and lonely\nYep, yep, yep\nLord of the sad and lonely\nAnd the ones that feel like shit on the daily\nI got you\n\nNow I can show you how to make it, no Domingo Dean\nIn a way in which this universe has never seen\nI feel the attention when I'm struttin' in my Prada boots\nCheck with my fresh, if you want I can style you\nSo unearthly, my profession is to wow you\nNigga how you not better than me? Listen I swear to Jesus\nI feel like Baby back in 99\nIn the SLS stunting and it's all mine\nShitting on these nigga sipping on some Swiss Kriss\nI got jewelry that is sitting on ma' slit wrist\nMy label fucking up my flow, see I'm getting pissed\nWork too damn hard fam, for the shenanigans\nDon't hang around bums, and that's how I win, fe fi fo fum\nHaters, how do my cum taste? No more fun, no jokes, no smile\nJust a grin that suggest I'm the best\nLiving like I got a motherfucking pump on my left at all times\nSo many kids live their life through my rhymes\nSee I'm in love with you all 'til the end\nWhen shit was dark for me you were my only friends\nOn the realer, so smoke some tree for your nigga\nAin't nobody got my bounce, know my juicy ounce\nWalk in rooms and fuckboys close their mouth\nThe Cud life, you know what we about\nLord of the Sad and Lonely"}}, {"title": "Love.", "album": null, "year": "2015-03-03", "lyrics": "I am happy to be alive\nCause I know I could not be in a place that's filled with lies\nCan't stand no quiet nights, while I fill up my glass with pride\nHopeful is all I know, how to keep me from silent cries\nNothing I can say\nFacing all this pain in my way\nI fight it every day\nWhy am I this way?\nA nigga tryna maintain\nI sit and tell myself, \"Okay\"\nWe gotta find another way\nYou gotta find another way\nYou gotta find another way\n\nDon't be so down, c'mon young homie\nYou'll be okay, you'll find real love\nAll of the stories, the hero gets lonely\nNow is the time to show what you're made of\nDon't be so down, c'mon young homie\nYou'll be okay, you'll find real love\nAll of the stories, the hero gets lonely\nNow is the time to show what you're made of\n\nI am happy to be alive\nCause I know I could not be in a place so filled with lies\nCan't stand no quiet nights, while I fill up my glass with pride\nHopeful is all I know, how to keep me from silent cries\nNothing I can say\nDone running from this pain in my way\nI'm fighting every day\nWhy am I this way?\nA nigga tryna maintain\nI sit and tell myself, \"Okay\"\nWe gotta find another way\nYou gotta find another way\nYou gotta find another way\n\nDon't be so down, c'mon young homie\nYou'll be okay, you'll find real love\nAll of the stories, the hero gets lonely\nNow is the time to show what you're made of\nDon't be so down, c'mon young homie\nYou'll be okay, you'll find real love\nAll of the stories, the hero gets lonely\nNow is the time to show what you're made of\n\n\nDon't be so down, c'mon young homie\nYou'll be okay, you'll find real love\nAll of the stories, the hero gets lonely\nNow is the time to show what you're made of", "image": "https://images.genius.com/f0891e406273fedeec5ecb48d2e678c7.1000x1000x1.jpg", "artist": "Kid Cudi", "raw": {"annotation_count": 12, "api_path": "/songs/716442", "description": {"dom": {"tag": "root", "children": [{"tag": "p", "children": ["Released to his ", {"tag": "a", "attributes": {"href": "https://soundcloud.com/cudderland/love", "rel": "nofollow"}, "children": ["Soundcloud"]}, " March 3rd, \u201cLove\u201d marked Cudder\u2019s first offering in ", {"tag": "a", "attributes": {"href": "https://genius.com/albums/Kid-cudi/Satellite-flight-the-journey-to-mother-moon"}, "data": {"api_path": "/albums/67138"}, "children": ["quite a while"]}, ".

keep it rolling now\nAin't no thing, you don't really need me\nThe pressure is growing\nHard times they mold you\nInto someone way colder\nLet the world see how you win\nNo matter how you seem to them\nFuck 'em\nFuck 'em\nFuck 'em\nFuck 'em\n\nAnd people think I'm mad (Or on one)\nThen won't you tell them I'm mad, solar\nAll the things that bother me\nAin't no other way I can be\nAnd people

in the mind\nEverything would be fine\nMaybe if I was a jerk to girls\nInstead of being nice and speaking kind words\nThen maybe it would be OK to say then\nI wasn't a good guy to begin with\n\nBut my mind is all crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy\nThey got me thinking I ain't human\nLike I came in from above, above, above, above\nFeeling like an airplane in the sky\nBut then they say I'm crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy\nThey got me thinking I ain't human\nLike I came in from above, above, above, above\nFeeling like a bird sitting high, high\n\nI be that man on the moon, I'm that man on the moon\nAnd I'mma do what I do, so do you, hey-hey\nI be posted with my blunt and a brew, my dude\nI'm that man on the moon, I'm up-up on the moon\n\nIt's like, I'mma play all my stuff for everybody\nAnd you know, and all my people they give me feedback\nYou know, and they'll be like\n\"Yo, yo, why your shit sound so different?\"\nYou know what I'm saying?\n\"Why your shit, like on another level--\nWhy's, why's it sound so different?\"\nLike that's a bad thing\nAnd I be like\n\"Why not? Nigga\"\n\nClose my eyes, hide in the dark\nIt's a curtain call; come one, come all\nAll I do is try to make it simple\nThe ones that make it complicated\nNever get congratulated\nI'm something different, all aspects\nDon't want a woman just to love her assets\nI'll still wife her up, even with her flat chest\nThe type to get hurt, but that's the past tense\n\nMy mind is all hazy, hazy, hazy, hazy\nI be thinkin' that I'm wrong\n'Cause they used to call me lame, lame, lame, lame\nMy swag was a little different\nBut then my mind is hazy, hazy, hazy, hazy\nI be thinkin' that I'm wrong\nBut they the ones who lame, lame, lame, lame\nI got the last laugh, nigga\n\nI be that man on the moon, I'm that man on the moon\nAnd I'mma do what I do, so do you, hey-hey\nI be posted with my blunt and a brew, my dude\nI'm that man on the moon, I'm up-up on the moon"}}, {"title": "Man on the Moon II: The Legend of Mr. Rager [Tracklist + Album Cover]", "album": "Man on the Moon II: The Legend of Mr. Rager", "year": "2010-11-09", "lyrics": "Tracklist: (Click links for lyrics)\nAct I: The World I Am Ruling\n1.

never look, rather read a book\nKnow I'm semi-wrong, got 'em shook\nNow they know Scott, and they know I plot\nDon't trust hoes, they just want the knot\nTill I abuse it, baby I love music,

they ain't get where I was going\nTook a turn to the worse when my father left me lonely\nLonely in my room, I-I mean me, up on the moon\nEntertained myself, laughed at myself\nAs I grew to be a teen I disguised myself\nHad the lowest self-esteem, especially with the girls\nTried every sport just to impress all the girls\nInstead of all the ladies, 'cause they talk down\nI was too artsy, known to be a clown\nAnd now my Facebook poppin'\n'Cause I told the same girls I would be the hot shit\nOne day\n\nThis will be my world\nI told you so\nThis will be my world\nI told you so\nThis will be my world\nI told you so\nThis will be my world\n\nBig homie, made the move\nMade-made the move, flew off the moon\nStill (had no-no one), no one to hang out with\nTalk that shit to just my Brooklyn niggas\nAll I would wonder is when will my time come\nHad mad jobs and I lost damn near all of them\nThink about my bosses, yep I hated all of them\nStudio at night had me hustlin' to most of them\nNigga I was late, damn near every day\nBut I'ma be on time when my stars align\nWhen my soul was happy on my Ramen diet\nFollowed by a loosey was the meal of grinders\nIf you knowin' the truth all you think about is that thing\nAlways be a hater tryna shoot down any dream\nUntil you meet a kid like K-I\nNiggas thought I was crazy, my mama know I stay high\nWe're getting money, mom\n\nThis will be my world\nI told you so\nThis will be my world\nI told you so\nThis will be my world\nI told you so\nThis will be my world\n\nI was heavy-heavy-heavy on my grizzle\nAnd none of y'all had a clue about me\nAnd none of y'all had a clue about me\nAnd none of y'all really knew about me\nI was heavy-heavy-heavy on my grizzle\nAnd none of y'all really cared about me\nAnd none of y'all really cared about me\nNow, guess what? I'm all you see, I'm all you see\n\nThis will be my world\nI told you so\nThis will be my world\nI told you so\nThis will be my world\nI told you so\nThis will be my

get enough sticky\nAnd if you don't get it I'll explain it to you simply\nAnd iffy iffy, then homie probably never get me\nNothin' really special about lil' ol' Cudder\nExcept the fact I'd slit my own throat for my mother\nIf it could make it stress free and then my brother could sacrifice\nA meal best served raw with a little steak sauce\nOh no, I bet you probably think I'm looney tune\nAfter big big country bought an album from a leak through\nHe was cool but just seems some type whatchamacall\nOther worldly, but I'm more of a worldly other\nSucker niggas like to state they undercover\nBut I'll peep ya, I'll see you from my cloud sanctuary\nAnd there's something about Mary\nShe made me un-tame\nThere was issues way before I smoked the phillies\n\nYou, you, you can look up, I never come down\nHome boy, I tap dance on the clouds\nWho, who, who is it?\nYou, you, you can look up, I never come down\nHome boy, I tap dance on the clouds\nWho, who, who is it?\nYou, you, you can look up, I never come down\nHome boy, I tap dance on the clouds\nWho, who, who is it?\nYou, you, you can look up, I never come down\nI tap dance on the clouds\n\nExpedited for you so homie run to it\nWe makin' the damn dough, who knew it\nAnd everybody in the game with the same ol'\nNo-no's I'll be doin' it, but Cudi from a different mode\nYou can keep it goin' though, no I will never slow\nOl' girl want purp, she is silly, yo\nI ain't trippin', I'm skippin' while I'm sippin' in\nWhile I go in though (again and again)\nTell them motherfuckin' let somebody tell new ones\nIf you get high still strive to be someone\nI am not a role model but I am the blueprint\nSuperstar concerts and honors when I spit\nOnly can be me, Scott, no one can do it, K\nOnly, I don't mean to be, I do it the CuDi way\nNo need to be mad if you not me\nLookin' for ill shit, you know where to find KC\nYeah, you know where to find KC\n\nYou, you, you can look up, I never come down\nHome boy, I tap dance on the clouds\nWho, who, who is it?\nYou, you, you can look up, I never come down\nHome boy, I tap dance on the clouds\nWho, who, who is it?\nYou, you, you can look up, I never come down\nHome boy, I tap dance on the clouds\nWho, who, who is it?\nYou, you, you can look up, I never come down\nI tap dance on the clouds"}}, {"title": "No One Believes Me", "album": null, "year": "2011-08-22", "lyrics": "Have you ever

Nothing\nYou don't really care about the trials of tomorrow\nRather lay awake in the bed full of sorrow\n\nI'm on the pursuit of happiness, and I know\nEverything that shine ain't always gonna be gold\nHey, I'll be fine once I get it\nI'll be good\nI'm on the pursuit of happiness, and I know\nEverything that shine ain't always gonna be gold\nHey, I'll be fine once I get it\nI'll be good\n\nI'm on the pursuit of happiness\nI know everything that shine ain't always gold\nI'll be fine once I get it\nI'll be good\n\n\nI'm on the pursuit of happiness, and I know\nEverything that shine ain't always gonna be gold\nHey, I'll be fine once I get it\nI'll be good\nI'm on the pursuit of happiness, and I know\nEverything that shine ain't always gonna be gold\nHey, I'll be fine once I get it\nI'll be good\n\nPursuit of happiness, yeah\nI gon' get it, I'll be good\nOh... oh man, oh, ugh\nRoom's spinning, room's spinning\nPat, Zuli...\nOh fuck, oh my God\nWhy'd I drink so much and smoke so much?

same\nCause I'm a just deal with the rain!\n\nI'm a Deal With The Rain\nTell God Just To Keep It The Same", "image": "https://images.genius.com/f0891e406273fedeec5ecb48d2e678c7.1000x1000x1.jpg",

mistakes, yes\nNo worries I just kill a bitch with success\nWhile she at home stressed out eating ice cream\nI'm at the Grammys living out a nice dream\nNo bitch on arm, just my words and my stoner charm\nWith my dimples deep, I smile at peace\nCause I went out and got what most y'all seek\nNow I'm the one you meet\nWho throws you the peace sign, missed not one step\nAnd this is just the first step\nGod walks with me, but I'm still vexed\n\nOh, how could this be?\nAll this time, I've lived vicariously\nWho's gonna save my soul now?\nWho's gonna save my soul now?\nHow will my story ever be

seller who I left with\nParallel levels in the dark, dark place\nTricked all you niggas to a dark, dark fate\nAnd guided you all with a smile upon my face\nAs the sun kisses us on the foreheads gently\nGentle with the drugs, heavy with the love\nAnd my speeches on stage rock mountains from a club\nMoney doesn't move me except on the literal\nG4 flights, now we're off to Australia\nI wanna see more of the world\nThese are more than just words\nThese are facts from a winner\n\nThis is a journey into the horizon\nYou can see past if it's real to you\nWe can meet on the other side\nOn the other side, ay\nThis is a journey into the horizon\nYou can see past if it's real to you\nThen we can meet on the other side\nOn the other side\n\nWhat up, how is everyone feeling?\nI hope you understand what you're hearing\nTake a minute to roll up for the wonderous\nClusterfuck of darkness and evil\nI will paint the Yin and the Yang for you\nAnd my jeans are Dior for the love of skinnies\nUpgraded, fitted it into the T\nWork hard, makin' sure I don't become a memory\nHard to press on when the memories remember me\nAnd they always find the perfect moment\nHigh speed, my momentum won't slow up none\nLost in the wind, I've lost all my friends\nMaybe they were never meant to be acquainted\nMoney seems to make everything tainted\nEverybody mad 'cause they stuck where I knew 'em last\nTook what I wanted and I did it all blunted\nOh, oh\n\nThis is a journey into the horizon\nYou can see past if it's real to you\nWe can meet on the other side\nOn the other side, ay\nThis is a journey into the horizon\nYou can see past if it's real to you\nWe can meet on the other side\nOn the other side", "image":

some Generation-Next shit\nSpeak for the seller who I left with\nParallel levels in the dark, dark place\nTricked all you niggas to a dark, dark fate\nAnd guided you all with a smile upon my face\nAs the sun kisses us on the foreheads gently\nGentle with the drugs, heavy with the love\nAnd my speeches on stage rock mountains from a club\nMoney doesn't move me except on the literal\nG4 flights, now we're off to Australia\nI wanna see more of the world\nThese are more than just words\nThese are facts from a winner\n\nThis is a journey into the horizon\nYou can see past if it's real to you\nWe can meet on the other side\nOn the other side, ay\nThis is a journey into the horizon\nYou can see past if it's real to you\nThen we can meet on the other side\nOn the other side\n\nWhat up, how is everyone feeling?\nI hope you understand what you're hearing\nTake a minute to roll up for the wonderous\nClusterfuck of darkness and evil\nI will paint the Yin and the Yang for you\nAnd my jeans are Dior for the love of skinnies\nUpgraded, fitted it into the T\nWork hard, makin' sure I don't become a memory\nHard to press on when the memories remember me\nAnd they always find the perfect moment\nHigh speed, my momentum won't slow up none\nLost in the wind, I've lost all my friends\nMaybe they were never meant to be acquainted\nMoney seems to make everything tainted\nEverybody mad 'cause they stuck where I knew 'em last\nTook what I wanted and I did it all blunted\nOh, oh\n\nThis is a journey into the horizon\nYou can see past if it's real to you\nWe can meet on the other side\nOn the other side, ay\nThis is a journey into the horizon\nYou can see past if it's real to you\nWe can meet on the other side\nOn the other side"}}, {"title": "Screwed", "album": "Speedin'

thousand thank you's way too late (what's the case?)\n\nThrough the agony and strife, I see my so called stinking life\nThrough the agony and strife, I see my so called stinking life\nThrough the

sicker plan\nSicker than any other nigga could be thinking, and\nI can't be a loser, could've figured that\nI can't be a lame, I'm cooler than that\nI feel I love the fame, then I hate it back, hmm\nThinking now what I should be twitterin'\nWhy'd big bro take all the hot bitches?\nDear God, me too, I like the hot bitches\nI'll be the underdog, all along, 'til I'm gone\nI will live through a song, I'll be strong through the haters\n\nAs simple as that, as simple as that\nAs simple as that for your simple ass\nAs simple as that, as simple as that\nAs simple as that for your simple ass\nAs simple as that, as simple as that\nAs simple as that for your simple ass\nAs simple as that\nAs simple as (1, 2, 3)\n\nUh, simple as that for your simple ass\nSimple way I wish you would've called it how it should've been\nThey try to tell me they don't get it, they don't underdig\nNow I'll be damned I came this far to let a fool live\nI gotta terminate the hate, spread the positive\nWithout it being wack and cheesy to the little kids\nSo I curse like a sailor and I smoke weed\nI am exactly who an older rapper's kids be\nAnd who they love, hands to the universe\nProbably think they drug addicts if they spit a Cudi verse\nMad lil mama switch to Converse without a purse\nLong as the booty lookin' juicy and he stylin' on 'em\n\nAs simple as that, as simple as that\nAs simple as that for your simple ass\nAs simple as that, as simple as that\nAs simple as that for your simple ass\nAs simple as that, as simple as that\nAs simple as that for your simple ass\nAs simple as that\nAs simple as (1, 2, 3)\n\nAs our hero seems to be dreaming in peace\nA dark chapter unfolds\nThrowing Scott into the most eerie\nAnd unstable part of his imagination\nSo intense he cannot tell his dreams from reality\nThis is the Rise of the Night Terrors"}}, {"title": "Skit 1", "album": "Rap Hard", "year": null, "lyrics": "Yeah man, this sh-\n\nYo man.

very, very familiar to me\nLike I've seen him before\nI've met him once before\nBut when I met him for the first time, I was like man\nI feel like I've seen this nigga somewhere\nBut, I couldn't really put my finger on it\nBut I realised, that I've never seen him before\nBut, I've seen somebody, that looked like the nigga\nBut then it hit me, this motherfucker looks like Tom Cruise\nAnd I'm not talking about -\nHe look like motherfucking, Mission impossible 2, Tom Cruise\nMotherfucking, Jerry Maguire, Tom Cruise, ya know what I'm saying\nNot The Last Samurai, Tom Cruise\nBut I'll talk about this Tom Cruise\nYa know what I'm saying like, before he went crazy Tom Cruise\n(DJ E-V)\nBut naw, if you ever see DJ E-V\nCome up to him be like, wassup Tom\nYou what I'm saying, give him dap\nTell him that you love his movies\nAnd he would definently appreciate that\nYou heard it from me, heard it from\nKid Cudi, it's the K.I.D\nYou can call me moon man"}}, {"title": "Sky High",

clouds up above man\nMetaphor to my life man\nStill I feel my\nHeart stronger than it's ever been\nStrong will 'til my journey ends\nUntil then I roll\nMore than I ever rolled\nNot pills, but the Mary though\nStill I feel my\nEyes heavy when the day goes\nNothing helping when my head doze\nBut I ain't sleep\nAwake in another state\nLiving in a new space\nStill I feel my\nMind running at a steady pace\nGod help me so I'll win the race\nUntil then I go\n\nThe sky might fall\nThe sky might fall\nBut I'm not worried at all\nC'mon, c'mon\nThe sky might fall\nThe sky might fall\nBut I'm not worried at all\n\nHey, hey\nI let 'em know somethin'\nI let 'em know somethin'\nI let 'em know somethin'\nYou can listen up, listen up, listen up, listen up\nHey, I let 'em know somethin'\nI let 'em know somethin'\nI let 'em know somethin'\nYou can listen up, listen up, listen up, listen up\n\nGrey clouds stuck together, fam\nLightning piercing through another land\nOver the desert where the lost play\nSoul searching each and every way\nAnd then you see the\nAwesome sound, so profound\nWhen it \u2013 it'll grip you\nYou can see it\nIf you hear it you can feel it too\nSomething special I am running to\nUntil then I go\nAway, very far away\nTo another universe\nWhere all the people say\nIt's the new-new place\nFor the special to embrace\nLike a Martian who seemingly\nWandered out of place\nTake what you need\nFrom the valley of the hope, where\nEven if you drown\nYou'll be floating higher up, and\nYou can say bye, bye, bye\nSky might be falling\nBut remember you can fly, high\n\nThe sky might fall\nThe sky might fall\nBut I'm not worried at all\nC'mon, c'mon\nThe sky might fall\nThe sky might fall\nBut I'm not worried at all\n\nHey, hey\nI let 'em know somethin'\nI let 'em know somethin'\nI let 'em know somethin'\nYou can listen up, listen up, listen up, listen up\nHey, I let 'em know somethin'\nI let 'em know somethin'\nI let 'em know somethin'\nYou can listen up, listen up, listen up, listen up\n\nI keep running, yeah\nI gotta keep up, I gotta keep up, yeah\nGotta keep up, I gotta keep up\nAnd I keep running, yeah\nI gotta keep up, I gotta keep up, yeah\nGotta keep up, I gotta keep up, yeah\n'Cause I'm gone\nYeah, na-na na-na, na-na na-na\nI'm up, and away\nNa-na, na-na\nKnow what I'm talkin' 'bout?\nHey, hey"}}, {"title": "Solo Dolo

to know, yes, I am on acid\nWho could it be? K-I-D\nSearching all day in the streets for DMT\nDon't sip it, though - it couldn't answer\nDrip, trip all day - bumpin' MGMT, homie\nWatch on who you hate on, fam', without the facts\nSad niggas back in the hood bumpin' Ratatat\nTo me it was a dream, a fiend to understand that\nYou never seen a nigga like me?\nI just tell 'em I'm an oxymoron when I open my mouth\nCause people talk shit before knowing what I'm about\nBut for sure these Cleveland boys is ill\nBut pretty soon your gutter bitches wildin' for real, it's such a trip\nHoes around the globe, I'm known to have a fet'\nI don't do a thing and these bitches lickin' they lips\nMe and Chip reflect on all the hate and jibber jabber\nMmm, you almost got me, but sucker I'm not a sucker\nBetter get on back\nYou pussy motherfuckers get the Will Smith smack\nAnd I am not a fronter, better look up the facts\nThe world know what it be: Mr. Rager, Solo Dolo, C.U.D., repeat it\n\nCome, come now, last call, who want some?\nIt's just me, two bitches and dirty drums\nTwo lips to kiss, 22 mother nuns\nGod blessed my tongue, I need it for life\nAwkward like Cartwright, twiddling my thumbs\nPondering my next accomplishments\nIt's condescending to say I won\nTwo lips, you kiss my ass tonight, huh?\n\nI really want it - need it\nBreak bread - or break fast\nBefore I blast and break legs, ride past\nAnd they scream out \"little Johnny is dead!\" (oh you dead nigga)\nYou wish me well, I wish you Hell\nEternity, no such thing as time will tell\nInfirmary, burn like magnetic combustion\nBad credit with me, and paramedics are hustlin'\nWhat's the definition of water?\nSherm sticks, sipped a gallon of it when you caught us\nTurn quick, I don't wanna play this for my daughter\nIf my son heard it, probably look at you as his father\nI'm proud of myself in a bad way\nHalfway house, tell it to meet me halfway\nI'm passin' out, ass whoopin'\nYour ass lookin' for Michelle Obama 'til I bang on you\nThey couldn't\n\nCome, come now, last call, who want some?\nIt's just me, two bitches and dirty drums\nTwo lips to kiss, 22 mother nuns\nGod blessed my tongue, I need it for life\nAwkward like Cartwright, twiddling my

K-I-D\nSearching all day in the streets for DMT\nDon't sip it, though - it couldn't answer\nDrip, trip all day - bumpin' MGMT, homie\nWatch on who you hate on, fam', without the facts\nSad niggas back in the hood bumpin' Ratatat\nTo me it was a dream, a fiend to understand that\nYou never seen a nigga like me?\nI just tell 'em I'm an oxymoron when I open my mouth\nCause people talk shit before knowing what I'm about\nBut for sure these Cleveland boys is ill\nBut pretty soon your gutter bitches wildin' for real, it's such a trip\nHoes around the globe, I'm known to have a fet'\nI don't do a thing and these bitches lickin' they lips\nMe and Chip reflect on all the hate and jibber jabber\nMmm, you almost got me, but sucker I'm not a sucker\nBetter get on back\nYou pussy motherfuckers get the Will Smith smack\nAnd I am not a fronter, better look up the facts\nThe world know what it be: Mr. Rager, Solo Dolo, C.U.D., repeat it\n\nCome, come now, last call, who want some?\nIt's just me, two bitches and dirty drums\nTwo lips to kiss, 22 mother nuns\nGod blessed my tongue, I need it for life\nAwkward like Cartwright, twiddling my thumbs\nPondering my next accomplishments\nIt's condescending to say I won\nTwo lips, you kiss my ass tonight, huh?\n\nI really want it - need it\nBreak bread - or break fast\nBefore I blast and break legs, ride past\nAnd they scream out \"little Johnny is dead!\" (oh you dead nigga)\nYou wish me well, I wish you Hell\nEternity, no such thing as time will tell\nInfirmary, burn like magnetic combustion\nBad credit with me, and paramedics are hustlin'\nWhat's the definition of water?\nSherm sticks, sipped a gallon of it when you caught us\nTurn quick, I don't wanna play this for my daughter\nIf my son heard it, probably look at you as his father\nI'm proud of myself in a bad way\nHalfway house, tell it to meet me halfway\nI'm passin' out, ass whoopin'\nYour ass lookin' for Michelle Obama 'til I bang on you\nThey couldn't\n\nCome, come now, last call, who want some?\nIt's just me, two bitches and dirty drums\nTwo lips to kiss, 22 mother nuns\nGod blessed my tongue, I need it for life\nAwkward like Cartwright, twiddling my

boys\nYou know how it be when you start living large\nI control my own life, Charles was never in charge\nNo sitcom could teach Scott about the dram\nOr even explain the troubles that haunted my mom\nOn Christmas time, my mom Christmas grind\nGot me most of what I wanted, how'd you do it mom, huh?\nShe copped the toys I would play with in my room by myself\n\"Why he by himself?\"\nHe got two older brothers, one hood, one good\nAn independent older sister kept me fly when she could\nBut they all didn't see, the little bit of sadness in me, Scotty\n\nI've got some issues that nobody can see\nAnd all of these emotions are pouring out of me\nI bring them to the light for you\nIt's only right\nThis is the soundtrack to my life, the soundtrack to my life\n\nI'm super paranoid, like a 6th sense\nSince my father died, I ain't been right since\nAnd I tried to piece the puzzle of the universe\nSplit an eighth of shrooms just so I could see the universe\nI tried to think about myself as a sacrifice\nJust to show the kids they ain't the only ones who up at night\nThe moon will illuminate my room and soon I'm consumed by my doom\nOnce upon a time nobody gave a fuck\nIt's all said and done and my cocks been sucked\nSo now I'm in the cut, alcohol in the wound\nMy heart's an open sore that I hope heals soon\nI live in a cocoon opposite of Cancun\nWhere it is never sunny, the dark side of the moon\nSo it's more than right, I try to shed some light on a man\nNot many people of this planet understand... fam\n\nI've got some issues that nobody can see\nAnd all of these emotions

would be slitting my throat\nIgnorance to cope man, ignorance is bliss\nIgnorance is love, and I need that shit\nIf I never did shows, then I'd probably be a myth\nIf I cared about the blogs, then I'd probably be a jackass\nDon't give a shit what people talkin' bout fam\nHaters shake my hand but I keep the sanitizer on deck\nHope I really get to see 30\nWanna settle down, stop being so flirty\nMost of the clean faces be the most dirty\nI just need a thoroughbred, cook when I'm hungry\nAss all chunky, brain is insanity\nOnly things that calm me down, pussy and some Cali trees\nAnd I get both, never truly satisfied\nI am happy, that's just the saddest lie\n\nI've got some issues that nobody can see\nAnd all of these emotions are pouring out of me\nI bring them to the light for you\nIt's only right\nThis is the soundtrack to my life, the soundtrack to my life", "image": "https://images.genius.com/efc07c09f2ac2b595d950ffcf79a1a73.1000x1000x1.jpg", "artist": "Kid Cudi", "raw":

how it be when you start living large\nI control my own life, Charles was never in charge\nNo sitcom could teach Scott about the dram\nOr even explain the troubles that haunted my mom\nOn Christmas time, my mom Christmas grind\nGot me most of what I wanted, how'd you do it mom, huh?\nShe copped the toys I would play with in my room by myself\n\"Why he by himself?\"\nHe got two older brothers, one hood, one good\nAn independent older sister kept me fly when she could\nBut they all didn't see, the little bit of sadness in me, Scotty\n\nI've got some issues that nobody can see\nAnd all of these emotions are pouring out of me\nI bring them to the light for you\nIt's only right\nThis is the soundtrack to my life, the soundtrack to my life\n\nI'm super paranoid, like a 6th sense\nSince my father died, I ain't been right since\nAnd I tried to piece the puzzle of the universe\nSplit an eighth of shrooms just so I could see the universe\nI tried to think about myself as a sacrifice\nJust to show the kids they ain't the only ones who up at night\nThe moon will illuminate my room and soon I'm consumed by my doom\nOnce upon a time nobody gave a fuck\nIt's all said and done and my cocks been sucked\nSo now I'm in the cut, alcohol in the wound\nMy heart's an open sore that I hope heals soon\nI live in a cocoon opposite of Cancun\nWhere it is never sunny, the dark side of the moon\nSo it's more than right, I try to shed some light on a man\nNot many people of this planet understand... fam\n\nI've got some issues that nobody can see\nAnd all of these emotions are pouring out of me\nI bring them to the light for you\nIt's only right\nThis is the soundtrack to my life, the soundtrack to my life\n\nI was close to go and trying some coke\nAnd a happy ending would be slitting my throat\nIgnorance to cope man, ignorance is bliss\nIgnorance is love, and I need that shit\nIf I never did shows, then I'd probably be a myth\nIf I cared about the blogs, then I'd probably be a jackass\nDon't give a shit what people talkin' bout fam\nHaters shake my hand but I keep the sanitizer on deck\nHope I really get to see 30\nWanna settle down, stop being so flirty\nMost of the clean faces be the most dirty\nI just need a thoroughbred, cook when I'm hungry\nAss all chunky, brain is insanity\nOnly things that calm me down, pussy and some Cali trees\nAnd I get both, never truly satisfied\nI am happy, that's just the saddest lie\n\nI've got some issues that nobody can see\nAnd all of these emotions are pouring out of me\nI bring them to the light for you\nIt's only

why all they girlfriends be wanting pictures\nI be flyer then a hundred navis, worth a hundred hundred-stacks\nI ain't gonna stop shoppin' till I hit a hundred sacks\nPolo that's a given I ain't even gotta mention\nCandy old-school put you niggas in detention\nSlabbed niggas deeped-up tool in the clothes\nI'm just a young fresh fly fool with some gold\n\nAy-ay, what it do my dude?\nI'm living life, dawg, what about you?\nAnd I ain't even gotta tell a lie\nMy swag, my steez got a nigga sky-high\nSo I'm, watchin' my moves\nFrom the shoes on the coupe\nBe damned if a nigga ain't high to the roof\nPimp tight get it right, homey, more or less\nI gotta thank God I'm fresh\n\nOh, I rearrange faces when I drop\nI'm super duper Cudi candy-paint the rag-top\nCan't nobody even tell me I don't sip 'em when I lean\nBut get me to my fans, I'm country to the seas\nPlease, I stay up on my creep so to come up\nGotta look the part superstar, no stunnas\nI'mma say some shit that make you think I lost my mind\nI'm the only nigga that could watch the sun and don't go blind\nShe fine as she wanna be, but she wanna check, though\nDodging and popping pictures like the ho's was working with the law\nBack in Shaker bitches, trynna play me to the left\nNow I pick the hoes that I want and give my niggas what is left\nI don't know if it's the name or the Bape gum bottoms\nKeep them on salute them 501's you can't knock 'em\nUse to have the Honda with the thirty-day tags\nThat was in the past now I'm bout to throw 'em on the Jag\n\nAy-ay, what it do my dude?\nI'm living life, dawg, what about you\nAnd I ain't even gotta tell a lie\nMy swag, my steez got a nigga sky-high\nSo I'm, watchin' my moves\nFrom the shoes on the coupe\nBe damned if a nigga ain't high to the roof\nPimp tight

Glover\nIn tune with my roots like the Reading Rainbow nigga\nI'm here to give the kids new li-ter-ature\nI am the cure to the wack juice over flow\nGettin' a new beat, recycle' their old flows\nWhat were they thinkin' when they wrote it?\nThe Lord knows, but I suppose raps hungry hungry hippos\nDecided to look over Kid Cudi with the glow\nCool beans though, 10 Deep jeans hoes\nStampede fitted, in the Range with a knitted\nNo gimmick, real time, real heart, real words, elegant, a piece of art\nI never be retro or like a cool kid\nWith only two songs, look at what I did\nNo famous name vouch and I'm still the shit\nNigga, first couple songs, no guest appearances\nNo big names, no big chains\nJust Plain Pat visions with some sick aim\nNow you sick mane, I ain't taking stabs\nI'm just taking names then I'm kickin' ass\nMe & my nigga Wale let them suckas pass\nUntil we fed up & wed up\nWhere niggas keep they swag to the heart\nRuin niggas hopes for success\nAfter Lebron, I'm what's next\nNext, next... to pass the baton of success\nI pass an event, hoes seem to forget\nMy only cash flow was from bape\nNow these hoes can't stunt pictures of my face\nThey know\n\nI'm the biggest

had to do it Mr. Ross\nI had to\n\nI am the man so proud I am\nCame here as a boy, staying here as a man\nPeople they don't get it, try to see it if you can\nLivin' in la la land ain't all that bad\nBecause...\n\nI'm the biggest grinder that you've seen this far\nI'm the biggest grinder that you've seen this far\nI'm the biggest grinder that you've seen this far\nI'm the biggest grinder that you've seen this far\nWant to look for me my nigga\nYou can look up at the stars\n\nI tap dance on the cloud like I'm Savion Glover\nIn tune with my roots like the Reading Rainbow nigga\nI'm here to give the kids new li-ter-ature\nI am the cure to the wack juice over flow\nGettin' a new beat, recycle' their old flows\nWhat were they thinkin' when they wrote it?\nThe Lord knows, but I suppose raps hungry hungry hippos\nDecided to look over Kid Cudi with the glow\nCool beans though, 10 Deep jeans hoes\nStampede fitted, in the Range with a knitted\nNo gimmick, real time, real heart, real words, elegant, a piece of art\nI never be retro or like a cool kid\nWith only two songs, look at what I did\nNo famous name vouch and I'm still the shit\nNigga, first couple songs, no guest appearances\nNo big names, no big chains\nJust Plain Pat visions with some sick aim\nNow you sick mane, I ain't taking stabs\nI'm just taking names then I'm kickin' ass\nMe & my nigga Wale let them suckas pass\nUntil we fed up & wed up\nWhere niggas keep they swag to the heart\nRuin niggas hopes for success\nAfter Lebron, I'm what's next\nNext, next... to pass the baton of success\nI pass an event, hoes seem to forget\nMy only cash flow was from bape\nNow these hoes can't stunt pictures of my face\nThey know\n\nI'm the biggest grinder that you've seen this far\nI'm the biggest grinder that you've seen this far\nI'm the biggest grinder that you've seen this far\nI'm the biggest grinder that you've seen this far\nWant to look for me my nigga\nYou can look up at the stars\n\nI am the man so proud I am\nCame here as a boy, staying here as a man\nPeople they don't get it, try to see it if you can\nLivin' in la la land ain't all that bad\nBecause...\n\nI'm the biggest grinder that you've seen this far\nI'm the biggest grinder that you've seen this far\nI'm the biggest grinder that you've seen this far\nI'm the biggest grinder that you've seen this far\nWant to look for me my nigga\nYou can look

(hey)\nI\u2019d never do it again (hey)\nCuz this is the end\n\nMy brother told me a long time ago\nDon't focus where you been, G, focus where you tryna go\nI swear the game make you cold like abominable snow man\nOld man when you trying to shine like gold\nWhen its my time to blow partner I'mma know\nIn the midst of getting dough I was hit with highs and lows\nMy Melo tried to play me like my fucking eyes was closed\nNow I'm sittin here wishing that my guys didn\u2019t know\nThey love a G, so they despise a soul\nWhat they gon\u2019 do to him, beyond my control\nWhen the reaper calls, it's your time to go\nNever play a nigga when you see that he is trying to grow\nI'm Benny Blanco when he knocked out Carlito\nAnd Pachanga so I'm watching every angle\nUnder the moonlight with the devil I've tangoed\nChurch on the move like Jesus in the manger\nBetter control the money, it's better to control the anger\nSo now I watch a friend the way that I watch a stranger\n(Chu'ch)\n\nI\u2019d never do it again\nDo it again\nI\u2019d never do it again\nCuz this is the end\nThis is the end\nThis is the end\nI\u2019d never do it again(hey)\nDo it again (hey)\nI\u2019d never do it again (hey)\nCuz this is the end\n\nChilling, rolling up something to change my feeling\nThinkin about how I came up from nothing while I\u2019m\nSplitting this cigarillo, phone rings I get a call\nOne of my dogs tripping hard talkin about really killin them all\nI say slow down, slow down\nWhat the fuck you mean nigga\nJust ran to your crib and popped your daughter in the spleen\nI\u2019ll be there in 20 minutes, but it only took fifteen\nWe wasn\u2019t that tight, but cool enough for me to hit the scene\nNot knowing this was all a set up\nSecretly they want me wet up\nJealous of my future cheddar, however\nThey fastest move was too slow for me\nI pulled up, wasn\u2019t no ambulance, there wasn\u2019t no police\nSomething fishy going on, naive, kept pressing on\nNine gripped, thinking the killer could still be on the lawn\nOpened the front door, they shot, I shot, some abrupt shit\nThe nigga with something to lose almost lost it, won't trust him again\n\nI\u2019d never do it again\nDo it again\nI\u2019d never do it again\nCuz this is the end\nThis is the end\nThis is the end\nI\u2019d never do it again(hey)\nDo it again (hey)\nI\u2019d never do it again (hey)\nCuz this is the end\n\nCheese came through at 3\nSalute, at ease, C had supplied the weed\nCause Ibn had OD'd\nIts me with a black rockstar steez\nReal rock tees, 300 a pop for these\nPlease, bummy? You don\u2019t know me money\nDay & Nite got flipped and I got blow for a grip\nSipping on a Heinie with my Jamie-boo besides me\nThat's my fucking best friend\nWhen I'm tweaking she be calming a brother\nLike the touch from a mother\nI am so damn comfortable I never want to leave it\nThe feeling is something like a spiritual healer\nThat could end me, I think that\u2019s the part I find intriguing\nA little bit off I am, I am, I am\nI see that I'm caught I am, I am, I am\nIt\u2019s something like a spiritual healer that could end me\nI think thats the part I find intriguing, I'm fiending\n\nI\u2019ll never do it again\nDo it again"}}, {"title": "The Guide", "album": "Passion, Pain & Demon Slayin'", "year": "2016-12-16", "lyrics": "Ain't the type to let you tell her what she needs\nAin't gon' sit or stand around\nI laid them all, I leave 'em sick, mamacita on me\nOne touch is never allowed\nShe said, \"What you want, what you want, what you want\nWhat you want, what you want, what you want, what you want?\nWhat you want, what you want, what you want, what you want\nWhat you want, what you want, what you want?\"\n\nOoh, ooh\nWhere you going?\nWhere you going?\nWhere you going?\nOoh, ooh, ooh, ooh\n\nI need a winning woman, a Wonder Woman\nA Gal Gadot, sophisticated and hot\nShe knowing what she doing, like the music here\nWhen she step on the scene she could light up the block, uh\nSitting all, took her, make her awesome\nCivil hearts hid them whole love back in a custom\nAin't too many women, I know\nWho could look at your soul, just from looking at you\nI heard she got these niggas falling at her feet\nShe kneels to no one with her golden crown\nYou'd be the one to play ball\nYou'd be the one to play ball\nHave mercy on me, put some magic on me\nBe my guide in the dark, uh\nHave mercy on me, put some magic on me\nBe my guide in the dark, guide in the dark\n\nOoh, ooh\nWhere you going?\nWhere you going?\nWhere you going?\nOoh, ooh, ooh, ooh\n\nSo when did we become so sophisticated and smart\nAnd trying so hard that we forgot that we were animals?\nBut never her, I never heard a creature make such sounds\nIt never would occur to people her up-downs\nConvertible, would murder evil, pup-pup hounds, just been dogging her\nCourtesy and real love found, just been dodging her\nMr. Man, misogyny hands been massaging her\nIf she ran and blew up her town, shit, I would pardon her\nPut a part in her scalp, scratch her dandruff\nPut her heart in your hand, she throw a tantrum\nBetter let her get that shit off, bug repellent\nHell, they've been telling her \"Nah\" since forever\nHarold Melvin and Bluenotes all she know\nMurder, murder, murder, m-murder all she wrote\nPerverted, she prefer to be hurted, claw her throat\nAll the dirty verdicts she learned watching soaps, yeah\n\nOoh, ooh\nWhere you going?\nWhere you going?\nWhere you going?\nOoh, ooh, ooh, ooh\n\nSemi-automatic with the passion when we making love\nNever made it to the bed, sexing on the living room floor\nNow she on the warpath, homie probably best that you don't piss her off\nGot this woman on the prowl, on the hunt she gon' eat 'em all\nAnd she know what she looking for, know what she looking for\nShe said she got herself some Louboutins, got her self some Louboutins\nNot indecisive, indecisive at all\nShe know what she looking for, got her some Louboutins\n\nOoh, ooh\nWhere you going?\nWhere you going?\nWhere you going?\nOoh, ooh, ooh, ooh", "image": "https://images.genius.com/efae5867d6e39372f9815e5f28cde6a5.1000x1000x1.jpg", "artist": "Kid Cudi", "raw": {"annotation_count": 14, "api_path": "/songs/2867471", "description": {"dom": {"tag": "root", "children": [{"tag": "p", "children": ["\u201cThe Guide\u201d is about bedroom passion with a woman who takes control.

around\nI laid them all, I leave 'em sick, mamacita on me\nOne touch is never allowed\nShe said, \"What you want, what you want, what you want\nWhat you want, what you want, what you want, what you want?\nWhat you want, what you want, what you want, what you want\nWhat you want, what you want, what you want?\"\n\nOoh, ooh\nWhere you going?\nWhere you going?\nWhere you going?\nOoh, ooh, ooh, ooh\n\nI need a winning woman, a Wonder Woman\nA Gal Gadot, sophisticated and hot\nShe knowing what she doing, like the music here\nWhen she step on the scene she could light up the block, uh\nSitting all, took her, make her awesome\nCivil hearts hid them whole love back in a custom\nAin't too many women, I know\nWho could look at your soul, just from looking at you\nI heard she got these niggas falling at her feet\nShe kneels to no one with her golden crown\nYou'd be the one to play ball\nYou'd be the one to play ball\nHave mercy on me, put some magic on me\nBe my guide in the dark, uh\nHave mercy on me, put some magic on me\nBe my guide in the dark, guide in the dark\n\nOoh, ooh\nWhere you going?\nWhere you going?\nWhere you going?\nOoh, ooh, ooh, ooh\n\nSo when did we become so sophisticated and smart\nAnd trying so hard that we forgot that we were animals?\nBut never her, I never heard a creature make such sounds\nIt never would occur to people her up-downs\nConvertible, would murder evil, pup-pup hounds, just been dogging her\nCourtesy and real love found, just been dodging her\nMr. Man, misogyny hands been massaging her\nIf she ran and blew up her town, shit, I would pardon her\nPut a part in her scalp, scratch her dandruff\nPut her heart in your hand, she throw a tantrum\nBetter let her get that shit off, bug repellent\nHell, they've been telling her \"Nah\" since forever\nHarold Melvin and Bluenotes all she know\nMurder, murder, murder, m-murder all she wrote\nPerverted, she prefer to be hurted, claw her throat\nAll the dirty verdicts she learned watching soaps, yeah\n\nOoh, ooh\nWhere you going?\nWhere you going?\nWhere you going?\nOoh, ooh, ooh, ooh\n\nSemi-automatic with the passion when we making love\nNever made it to the bed, sexing on the living room floor\nNow she on the warpath, homie probably best that you don't piss her off\nGot this woman on the prowl, on the hunt she gon' eat 'em all\nAnd she know what she looking for, know what she looking for\nShe said she got herself some Louboutins, got her self some Louboutins\nNot indecisive, indecisive at all\nShe know what she looking for, got her some Louboutins\n\nOoh,

young and wild take chances together\nThey all jump up, twist and groove\nBut no one talks - lost in the motherfuckin mood\n\nNo one talks - lost in the mood\nNo one talks - sweatin it out, lost in the mood\n\nThere's a hunger in the night\nThe moonlight kissing the nips on a model frame\nI kissed her inner thigh\nClosed my eyes, she began to make me fish\nShe like to go the mile\nAll the while I could see her tear a bit\nI forgot her name, somethin that sound like Penelope\nMaybe a French twang to it\nHer tongue was quick, she was French I knew it\nA lovely foreigner, foreign to racism\nShe like that young nigga vibe\nMy brown skin, my shagged out 'fro\nI'm king to her, and she will please her friend for me\nSo funny how the starvin are guardless\nNaked is always honest\nHer hands all over my privates\nLost in the mood\n\nNo one talks - lost in the mood\nNo one talks - sweatin it out, lost in the mood\n\nBut no one talks, lost in the motherfuckin mood\n\nNo one talks - lost in the

thinking God\nMade me special here on purpose\nSo all the while, 'til I'm gone\nMake my words important\nSo if I slip away, if I die today\nThe last thing you remember won't be\nAbout some apple bottom jeans\nWith the boots with the fur\nMaybe how I dreamed of being free since my birth\nCursed, but the demons I confronted would disperse\nHave you ever heard of some shit so real\nBeyond, from the heart, from the soul, you can feel\n\nAnd if I die before I wake\nI pray the Lord, my soul, to take\nBut please don't cry\nJust know that I have made these songs for you\nAnd if I die before I wake\nI pray the Lord, my soul, to take\n'Cause I'm ready for the funeral\n\nMy mind runs\nI could never catch it\nEven if I got a head start\nGod please help me\nI am feeling so alone, wait\nI don't need to worry\n'Cause I know the world'll feel this, nigga\nBlessing in disguise, but\nI am not hiding who I am, open your eyes, bro\nIf I ever met you, I appreciate the love, yo\nGirls that I dated, it's okay, I am not mad, yo\nUnless you stabbed me in the heart, no love ho\nThe shit is so ill\nPlay it back from the top if you recognize real\n\nAnd if I die before I wake\nI pray the Lord, my soul, to take\nBut please don't cry\nJust know that I have made these songs for you\nAnd if I die before I wake\nI pray the Lord, my soul, to take\n'Cause I'm ready for the funeral\nAnd if I die before I wake\nI pray the Lord, my soul, to take\nBut please don't cry\nJust know that I have made these songs for you\nAnd if I die before I wake\nI pray the Lord, my soul, to take\n'Cause I'm ready for the funeral\n\nI'm ready for that\nI'm ready for the funeral, hey-hey\nI'm ready for the funeral, hey\nI'm ready for the funeral\nHey, I'm ready for it\nI'm ready for it\nI'm ready for the

the cage\nSky rainin' down flames, it's a war on the heavens\nA beautiful scene in the night behind light\nAnd much like that, when I'm dreamin', I'm in flight\nCoast out of site, though I'm feelin' I'm not right\nAnd Hell's got one hell of a grip, no shit\nYour boy best not slip, get stuck in your grave\nJust to live another day, fightin' through decay\nCall on my angels and I kneel as I pray\nGot my mind, my soul and my heart on the same wave\nIt took me a minute, now I'm all in it, damn\nWhile I'm out of the dark, I push it to the limit, friend\nSo ready, I'm sharp, here comes the demolition man\nPack 'em up and just hittin', aimin' and never missin'\nServin' up the prescription, no time for intermission\nRippin'\n\nFeel it comin' on, comin' on and I know\nFindin' my way, somethin' is guidin' me\nFeel it comin' on, comin' on and I know\nFight 'til I'm done, it's just the rage in me\n\nDespite all my rage, I am still just a rat in a cage\nOh, no\nDespite all my rage, I am still just a rat in a cage\nNooooooo, oh\nThen someone will say, what is lost can never be saved\nOooooh, oh, oh-ohhhh\nDespite all my rage, I am still just a rat in a cage\nOooooh, oh, oh-ohhhh\n\nYeah, yo\nYeah\n\nThe world's got hope in the city with a reward\nMade for the pain, it's a battle I'm runnin' toward\nCall to the don, I'm embracin' it to the core\nForced into fightin', get ready for many more\nAnd I'm for mine from the jump, I ride or die with the pump\nI'm squeezin' for that release, I aim and let it dump\nI hear a roar of a sound, I'm feelin' it through the ground\nMayhem in the city, escapin' but I am found\nI rise up amongst the many with no fear\nFull squad, we at it, we finish 'em all, clear\nThrough the rubble, we rumble, never runnin' from trouble\nKeep my head on a swivel, you know I'm scorin' for double\nSearchin' for that release, swimmin' at it, repeat\nWash your hands of them sins and fightin' 'til we see peace\nIt's the least we could do in a world that needs the brave\nKnow the lost can be saved, survivin' the end of days\n\nFeel it comin' on, comin' on and I know\nFindin' my way, somethin' is guidin' me\nFeel it comin' on, comin' on and I know\nFight 'til I'm done, it's just the rage in me\n\nDespite all my rage, I am still just a rat in a cage\nOh, no\nDespite all my rage, I am still just a rat in a cage\nNooooooo,

light\nAnd much like that, when I'm dreamin', I'm in flight\nCoast out of site, though I'm feelin' I'm not right\nAnd Hell's got one hell of a grip, no shit\nYour boy best not slip, get stuck in your grave\nJust to live another day, fightin' through decay\nCall on my angels and I kneel as I pray\nGot my mind, my soul and my heart on the same wave\nIt took me a minute, now I'm all in it, damn\nWhile I'm out of the dark, I push it to the limit, friend\nSo ready, I'm sharp, here comes the demolition man\nPack 'em up and just hittin', aimin' and never missin'\nServin' up the prescription, no time for intermission\nRippin'\n\nFeel it comin' on, comin' on and I know\nFindin' my way, somethin' is guidin' me\nFeel it comin' on, comin' on and I know\nFight 'til I'm done, it's just the rage in me\n\nDespite all my rage, I am still just a rat in a cage\nOh, no\nDespite all my rage, I am still just a rat in a cage\nNooooooo, oh\nThen someone will say, what is lost can never be saved\nOooooh, oh, oh-ohhhh\nDespite all my rage, I am still just a rat in a cage\nOooooh, oh, oh-ohhhh\n\nYeah, yo\nYeah\n\nThe world's got hope in the city with a reward\nMade for the pain, it's a battle I'm runnin' toward\nCall to the don, I'm embracin' it to the core\nForced into fightin', get ready for many more\nAnd I'm for mine from the jump, I ride or die with the pump\nI'm squeezin' for that release, I aim and let it dump\nI hear a roar of a sound, I'm feelin' it through the ground\nMayhem in the city, escapin' but I am found\nI rise up amongst the many with no fear\nFull squad, we at it, we finish 'em all, clear\nThrough the rubble, we rumble, never runnin' from trouble\nKeep my head on a swivel, you know I'm scorin' for double\nSearchin' for that release, swimmin' at it, repeat\nWash your hands of them sins and fightin' 'til we see peace\nIt's the least we could do in a world that needs the brave\nKnow the lost can be saved, survivin' the end of days\n\nFeel it comin' on, comin' on and I know\nFindin' my way, somethin' is guidin' me\nFeel it comin' on, comin' on and I know\nFight 'til I'm done, it's just the rage in me\n\nDespite all my rage, I am still just a rat in a cage\nOh, no\nDespite all my rage, I am still just a rat in a cage\nNooooooo, oh\nThen someone will say, what is lost can never be saved\nOooooh, oh, oh-ohhhh\nDespite all my rage, I am still just a rat in a cage\nOooooh, oh, oh-ohhhh\n\nNa-na-na, na-na-na\nDe-ruh-de-meh-nah\nNa-na-na, na-na-na\nHmmmmmmmmm\nNa-na-na, na-na-na\nNa-na-na, na-na-na\nDe-ruh-de-meh-nah\nNa-na-na,

nigga \"young, learn to be the best\"\nAnd if I can't do that mayne, what the fuck I'm living for?\nI got a pack of Newports and a super-bad whore\nI step out and I drink a lot of Hennessey\nBattle in my sleep with the demons tryna ruin me\nA bunch of discouraging words, saying that fame wasn't meant for me\nTake it back to Cleveland, you heard?\nI can't stop them from speaking\nTheir visions are intense, got me laid out leaking\nY'all don't know the half, kid cudi got issues mentally\nThat I scribble down fast, like\nI won't fold, I can't fold\nI won't fold dogg, I can't fold\nIs what I say to myself over and over\nCruising through the city in my black Range Rover\n\nHeard em' whispering, I heard them talking now\nNow that I'm bubblin'\nThought I forgot how you\nTryna take me off my grind\nYup, yup, they tryna take me off my grind\nBut it's my time, boy\nWe going straight to the top\nWatch me live, my nigga\n\nWhen you making moves, everybody pounding you\nBut when you down and out, niggas won't acknowledge you\nSick to the stomach when I think about losing, but\nI like this music, so this the life that I'm choosing..\nI had to find out who the real Scott was\nMeditated with the wolves, all focused to get my hunger back\nSo alone, just me and an instrumental\nThey say my music ain't normal\nMust be something up with my mental\nI don't spit about guns and drugs\nWell dumb fuck I don't know about guns and drugs\nI spit what I know, and you should too!\nBut you won't, we all know, you wanna jock the next dude\nAnd you follow the next man\nWell I was born to be a leader so you know that I'mma follow my heart fam\nAnd I'mma roll with what my nigga Manny said\n\"Keep your individuality because that's what's gonna get you bread\"\n\n\nI ain't tryna make hits for the club no more\nI'm just tryna make hits for my niggas at war\nDay to day in the White Man's World\nGetting head from the white man's girl, that's me\nWhen I'm stressed\nHaving dreams of a dark-skinned chick with big breasts\nWhile I'm thinking of steps to be king, just like in chess\nKid Cudi won't rest, that's when I'm at my best\nFlow's good ?

lot of Hennessey\nBattle in my sleep with the demons tryna ruin me\nA bunch of discouraging words, saying that fame wasn't meant for me\nTake it back to Cleveland, you heard?\nI can't stop them from speaking\nTheir visions are intense, got me laid out leaking\nY'all don't know the half, kid cudi got issues mentally\nThat I scribble down fast, like\nI won't fold, I can't fold\nI won't fold dogg, I can't fold\nIs what I say to myself over and over\nCruising through the city in my black Range Rover\n\nHeard em' whispering, I heard them talking now\nNow that I'm bubblin'\nThought I forgot how you\nTryna take me off my grind\nYup, yup, they tryna take me off my grind\nBut it's my time, boy\nWe going straight to the top\nWatch me live, my nigga\n\nWhen you making moves, everybody pounding you\nBut when you down and out, niggas won't acknowledge you\nSick to the stomach when I think about losing, but\nI like this music, so this the life that I'm choosing..\nI had to find out who the real Scott was\nMeditated with the wolves, all focused to get my hunger back\nSo alone, just me and an instrumental\nThey say my music ain't normal\nMust be something up with my mental\nI don't spit about guns and drugs\nWell dumb fuck I don't know about guns and drugs\nI spit what I know, and you should too!\nBut you won't, we all know, you wanna jock the next dude\nAnd you follow the next man\nWell I was born to be a leader so you know that I'mma follow my heart fam\nAnd I'mma roll with what my nigga Manny said\n\"Keep your individuality because that's what's gonna get you bread\"\n\n\nI ain't tryna make hits for the club no more\nI'm just tryna make hits for my niggas at war\nDay to day in the White Man's World\nGetting head from the white man's girl, that's me\nWhen I'm stressed\nHaving dreams of a dark-skinned chick with big breasts\nWhile I'm thinking of steps to be king, just like in chess\nKid Cudi won't rest, that's when I'm at my best\nFlow's good ? I see the rest mayne\nA lot of cats tryna make it happen through the music\nTruest thing about it is not everyone can do this\nGotta spit it different from another nigga living\nIf I ain't, I'm slippin\nAnd I'm never getting up\nWith that in your head, dogg, I'm never giving up\nLooking up at the ceiling, chillin at my wake\nThese lames gotta hate, see the lyrical wizardry\nAiring out my dirty laundry for these niggas that ?"}}, {"title": "Too Bad I Have To Destroy You Now", "album": "Satellite Flight: The Journey To Mother Moon ", "year": "2014-02-25", "lyrics": "Mmmmhmmmmm, yeah, mmmhmmmhmmm\n\nPeople talk shit' bout me\nDeep down they knowin\u2019 they ain\u2019t right\nWhen I walk in the room they can\u2019t look in my eyes\nWhen I walk in the room they can\u2019t look in my eyes\nPeople talk shit 'bout me, and they know that I know\nAnd they also knowing they ain\u2019t right\nWhen I walk in the room they can\u2019t look in my eyes\nCause when I walk in the room they can\u2019t look in my eyes\n\nRejuvenated, recreated, rebooted, in a new program\nPrada calf\u2019s, black skinnies, T and hoody\nY\u2019all niggas know the brand, GQ mustachin\u2019 I\u2019m in LA\nSoaking up the sun and I\u2019m laughing, what can I say?\nI love the way the fans say they love me\nI know it\u2019s all because my God above me\nBut damn I\u2019m feeling like Sam\nExcept my daddy ain\u2019t stuck up no video game\nThings changed, for the good\nHe watched my back until the world started knowin\u2019 my name\nThis should be in the Bible\nMiddle finger up to the people who don\u2019t like you\nWho have no valid reason to say they never liked you\nWe don\u2019t give a fuck fam\nSo what?!

roll\nIt's so simple what I need\nYou know I keep my fam, but I can't forget that tree\n\nI got fam, dogg, I got my niggas\nGot a little money y'all, and I ain't trippin\nMost things are faded, feeling x-rated\nSteady want them freaky hoes, then I want a lady\nHolding the fam down, and my close homies\nThe peoples that were there\nWhile some suckers left me lonely, phoney\nWhen you see a nigga, don't approach me\nMade it to the top, baby, it's all me\nCats trying to claim that they made me\nHowever you feel, I know the real fugazi\nI keep it hundred, never frontin', no need be\nWhen I'm in the zone, no place for pussy, my nigga\nConyo to haters who don't know\nLoco, how a nigga like the postal\nThe ones fans love, who was always approachable, yo\nAnd I rep the double O's, double O's..\n\n\nThousand pounds of weed\nDriving in my car so fast I won't turn down the speed\nThem hoes don't use their feet\nThey break down to their knees\nAnd suck me like a king. Ros\u00e9 in my champagne glass\nAnd diamonds in my ring\nRoll something\nThat's your bitch on my dick?\nWell, I'mma let her hold something\nYou niggas smokin' seven I'mma need a whole onion. Woah youngin'!\nSame ones that hate same ones that tag along\nThem black dreads that make them lame niggas call my phone\nCall me \"World Wide Wiz\" cause I'm never home\nEver leave me 'round your bitch, I'mma get her stoned\nAnd you know that I rock camos and brought fros back\nAnd go download some of my old tracks\nAnd go play somewhere songs at\nFuckin high, fuckin high, fuckin high", "image": "https://images.genius.com/f0891e406273fedeec5ecb48d2e678c7.1000x1000x1.jpg", "artist": "Kid Cudi", "raw": {"annotation_count": 17, "api_path": "/songs/50591", "description": {"dom": {"tag": "root", "children": [{"tag": "p", "children": [{"tag": "a", "attributes": {"href": "https://genius.com/artists/Kid-cudi"}, "data": {"api_path": "/artists/68"}, "children": ["Kid Cudi"]}, " claims to have quit drugs \u2013 but this mash-up indicates that he may have ", {"tag": "a", "attributes": {"href": "https://genius.com/posts/420-news-kid-cudi-quits-quitting-weed"}, "children": ["quit quitting"]}, " weed, at least (", {"tag": "a", "attributes": {"href": "https://genius.com/artists/Wiz-khalifa"}, "data": {"api_path": "/artists/310"}, "children": ["Wiz Khalifa"]}, " is known to be a bad influence in this respect..)"]}, "", {"tag": "p", "children": [{"tag": "img", "attributes": {"src": "https://images.rapgenius.com/c17491be61004ec54bc61e8accb3ace6.640x427x1.jpg", "alt": "", "width": 640, "height": 427}, "data": {"animated": "false", "thumbnail": {"src": "https://images.rapgenius.com/c17491be61004ec54bc61e8accb3ace6.300x200x1.jpg", "height": 200, "width": 300}}}]}, "", {"tag": "p", "children": ["(Really tho, this song was originally just Cudi and Snoop.

shining, keep on grinding\nWhat you see ain't all of me\nThough I keep them hoes, don't love them hoes\nThe code in which I roll\nIt's so simple what I need\nYou know I keep my fam, but I can't forget that tree\n\nI got fam, dogg, I got my niggas\nGot a little money y'all, and I ain't trippin\nMost things are faded, feeling x-rated\nSteady want them freaky hoes, then I want a lady\nHolding the fam down, and my close homies\nThe peoples that were there\nWhile some suckers left me lonely, phoney\nWhen you see a nigga, don't approach me\nMade it to the top, baby, it's all me\nCats trying to claim that they made me\nHowever you feel, I know the real fugazi\nI keep it hundred, never frontin', no need be\nWhen I'm in the zone, no place for pussy, my nigga\nConyo to haters who don't know\nLoco, how a nigga like the postal\nThe ones fans love, who was always approachable, yo\nAnd I rep the double O's, double O's..\n\n\nThousand pounds of weed\nDriving in my car so fast I won't turn down the speed\nThem hoes don't use their feet\nThey break down to their knees\nAnd suck me like a king. Ros\u00e9 in my champagne glass\nAnd diamonds in my ring\nRoll something\nThat's your bitch on my dick?\nWell, I'mma let her hold something\nYou niggas smokin' seven I'mma need a whole onion. Woah youngin'!\nSame ones that hate same ones that tag along\nThem black dreads that make them lame niggas call my phone\nCall me \"World Wide Wiz\" cause I'm never home\nEver leave me 'round your bitch, I'mma get her stoned\nAnd you know that I rock camos and brought fros back\nAnd go download some of my old tracks\nAnd go play somewhere songs at\nFuckin high, fuckin high, fuckin high"}},

All my youngins out here reppin, Asap Rocky and the whole ASAP family, Travis Scott, SuperDuper Kyle, Audio Push, Hit Boy, etc, I see yall. And all u jealous chicken hearted shits I see you too.\nI am the culture.\nI keep silent because I dont ever wanna come off like some angry hater, but today, not only do I feel fantastic, Im feelin like taking over. I already have.\nMy tweets apply to who they apply. Ye, Drake, whoever. These niggas dont give a fuck about me. And they aint fuckin with me. Niggas keep you close when they see how powerful you are by yourself. When they see your greatness. Out of fear\nIve been loyal to those who haven't been to me and that ends now. Now im your threat.\nAnybody got a issue with my words im glad. If you feel me, dont be scared to use your voice. I was for so long out of blind loyalty.\nFrom here Ill let the music speak.

somehow in my bedroom\nTurn around\nSee myself in the mirror, I guess I'm cool\nAnd those happy thoughts in my head\nI'm feeling like I'm Peter Pan\nMinus the tights and the fairies\nHappy to see how far I've come\nTo the same place it began\nMy dreams and imagination\nPerfectly at peace\nSo I move along a bit higher\n\nI'll be up-up and away, up-up and away\n'Cause they gon' judge me anyway\nSo, whatever\nI'll be up-up and away, up-up and away\n'Cause in the end they'll judge me anyway\nSo, whatever\n\nHigher learnin'\nI see the dreams I made\nSo I'm cooler now\nI can take care of my mom and my little niece Zuri\nSo sing along lil mama\nYou ain't gotta worry 'bout no drama, no\nI provide for friends and fam and fans\nAnd Cleveland City grinding, man\nStay afloat\nThe key is hope\nI'll never let a motherfucka break me, dawg\nWho gives a fuck?\nIf a nigga don't like your steeze\nTell 'em to buzz off your n-u-t's\nWe don't care what people say\nDudes who critique your clothes are most gay\nI ain't gotta wait for no one\nIf I wanna fly, I can fly for freedom, hey\n\nI'll be up-up and away, up-up and away\n'Cause they gon' judge me anyway\nSo, whatever\nI'll be up-up and away, up-up and away\n'Cause in the end they judge me anyway\nSo, whatever\n\nWake up, wake up, wake, wake up, wake\nWake, wake up, wake up, wake, wake up, wake\n(Yeah)\nWake, wake up, wake up, wake, wake up, wake\n(We'll be rolling one up)\nWake, wake up, wake up, wake, wake up, wake\n(We'll be rolling one up)\nWake, wake up, wake up, wake, wake up, wake\n(We'll be rolling one up)\nWake, wake up, wake up,

up and away, up up and away\n'Cause they gon' judge me anyway\nSo, whatever\nI'll be up up and away, up up and away\n'Cause in the end they'll judge me anyway\nSo, whatever\nI'll be up up and away, up up and away\n'Cause they gon' judge me anyway\nSo, whatever\nI'll be up up and away, up up and away\n'Cause in the end they'll judge me anyway\nSo, whatever\nWhatever\nSo, whatever\nWhatever\nSo,

It's the big boss\nNew kid on the block, Mr. Rudolf (Kevin)\nTwo stars, hold your applause\nI hold it down he holds all guitars\nHalf my life I sacrificed, but I only came to party tonight\nNew chicks, get my drinks up\nEvery weekend we can link up\nNew rings, with the pink cuts\nYou'll need a passport, get your Minks up\nTook my turn she love it, each touch\nAnd when she closes her eyes

It's the big boss\nNew kid on the block, Mr. Rudolf (Kevin)\nTwo stars, hold your applause\nI hold it down he holds all guitars\nHalf my life I sacrificed, but I only came to party tonight\nNew chicks, get my drinks up\nEvery weekend we can link up\nNew rings, with the pink cuts\nYou'll need a passport, get your Minks up\nTook my turn she love it, each touch\nAnd when she closes her eyes this what she thinks of, Boss\n\nWelcome to the world, welcome to the world, welcome to the world, welcome to the world"}}, {"title": "Whenever", "album": "A Kid Named Cudi", "year": "2008-07-17", "lyrics": "Focus baby don't look at me\nSee right through me\nUnderstand my heartbeat\nMurmurs to mock your rhythm\nYeah, my nuts, the other girls want 'em\nBut they can't have\nAt least for the moment\nI'm with you there could be people around\nI'm just focused on you\nYou can sip chardonnay and I'mma have myself a brew\nI'm a country ass nigga baby\nYou know how I roll\nYour face, never seen something more perfect\nYou dance in my mind like Justice\nI know you listening back like damn, bro!\nLaid back so gentle like the violins\nLay on the beat and we don't have to be discreet\nCan I have a taste?

bullets\nI guess the fact my father smoked and drank\nMade it a young nigga destiny to do the exact same\nYoung wild'n all, me and my Codys\nWatch the phonies, and hoes that claim they blew me\nDark skin China doll with the fake tits\nIce grillin my Spanish chick, word\nWe all in together, now we off it\nCops be buggin, shotguns on the whip\nFuck 'em, I would never sweat for a piggie\nYou can catch me high, it's all good, no biggie\n\nI be wild'n cuz I'm young\nWil-wild'n cuz I'm young\nWild'n cuz I'm young\nWil-wild'n cuz I'm young\nI be wild'n cuz I'm young\nI be wild'n cuz I'm

Cud in the club\nWe don't have Plain Pat ready\nIce is thrown and the whole crew gone\nDone off for better and very celebratory\nFuck the blogs, I'mma tell my story\nNo matter the phase, my name is engraved\nIn the minds of the young'ns who be livin' to they graves\nYou live and you learn\nDoing bumps in the day and keep blunts to burn\n\nI be wild'n cuz I'm young\nWil-wild'n cuz I'm

another shade\nAwesome, no more bitches playin' possum\nPop and lock 'em and send 'em on home\nTired of hoes, all they want is to get chose\nKnow the code, want a woman with some toes\nOptimos, takin'

deep, deep\nOh to find your truth, your truth will speak, speak to you\n\nI'ma sew these wounds, I-I'ma sew these wounds myself\nI'ma sew these wounds, I'ma sew these wounds myself\nHmmm, hmmm\n\nWe all have times when we weep\nIt's a troubled life, traumatized psychologically\nI pray, in the shadows when I'm speakin' to no one\nMyself, did everything right, didn't I?\nSo why aren't I whole?\nYou know you better dig deeper\nDon't lie to you\nYou better dig deep, deep\n\nI'ma sew these wounds, I-I'ma sew these wounds myself\nI'ma sew these wounds, I'ma sew these wounds myself\nHmmm,

that I have\nYou'll probably never, find out ever\nI'll admire from afar, star\nKeep doing all the great things you're doing\nYou got it going on, young lady\n\nJesus Christ, girl!\nYou got it goin on

cool?\nFools probably try to spit at you daily\nThe price you pay cause you're hot\nHas anyone told you that you're fresh as hell\nAnd I dig the way you wear your hair too\nIt makes you look more mature\nSee I just wanna be a man and I think you can be the one to guide me\nBut who the fuck am I kidding\nMan you know they say I'm wild\nBut real people rarely come around if ever\nYou got it

smart\nYou've got a good head on your shoulders\nThat's what turns a nigga on, strong feelings that I have\nYou'll probably never, find out ever\nI'll admire from afar, star\nKeep doing all the great things you're doing\nYou got it going on, young lady\n\nJesus Christ, girl!\nYou got it goin on young lady\nJesus Christ, girl!\nYou got it goin on young lady\nJesus Christ, girl!\nYou got it goin on young lady\nJesus Christ, girl!\nYou got it goin on young lady\n\nHow'd you get so fuckin cool?\nFools probably try to spit at you daily\nThe price you pay cause you're hot\nHas anyone told you that you're fresh as hell\nAnd I dig the way you wear your hair too\nIt makes you look more mature\nSee I just wanna be a man and I think you can be the one to guide me\nBut who the fuck am I kidding\nMan you know they say I'm wild\nBut real people rarely come around if ever\nYou got it going on young lady\n\nJesus Christ, girl!\nYou got it goin on young lady\nJesus Christ, girl!\nYou got it goin on young lady\nJesus Christ, girl!\nYou got it goin on young lady\nJesus Christ, girl!\nYou got it goin on young lady\n\nYou turn a nigga on, these feelings I have\nYou'll find out never, unless you're clever\nI'll admire you from afar, star\nKeep doing all the great things you're doing\nYou got it going on, young lady\n\nJesus Christ, girl!\nYou got it goin on young lady\nJesus Christ, girl!\nYou got it goin on young lady\nJesus Christ, girl!\nYou got it goin on young lady\nJesus Christ, girl!\nYou got it goin on young lady"}}], "artist": "Kid Cudi"}
