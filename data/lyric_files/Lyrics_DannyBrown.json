bottoms of pleas, from the waywarded seas\n\nArthritis in her fingers, carpal tunnel in her wrists\n'Bout to feed her kids at night sit between her legs and twist\nWhile she listen to the oldie soap operas smoking bogies\nOn the phone gossiping telling homegirls stories\nGirlfriend worried cause her son's in a hurry\nTo see the state Pen' or a cemetery buried\nMa replied do her best but it's still rough\nKeep your kids off the street and away from drugs\nDoing hair in the house ain't putting on Daniel\nDaddy in and out, ay, who turned that channel?\nSneakers turn to house shoes, stepping on the back\nAshing her cigarette in a brown paper bag\nSmoking joints, lauging tryna get the part straight\nFor ten, put your perm in, don't scratch all day\nHot cocoa stove, put the food in the bowl\nSay that's how many nights it was hard to keep going\nNow I'm trapped in the trap and the devil ain't forgetting\nWanna see me dead or locked in a prison\nIn the system with division only thing that add up\nFucked up cause a nigga tryna get a couple bucks\nNow I'm trapped in the trap and the devil ain't forgetting\nWanna see me dead or locked in a prison\nIn the system with division only

good night fast food\nIf you really balling, mommy cop Chinese food\nIf you really wonder why these people got issues\nCause the rent owed and the fucking lights due\nOn her knees at night, pray a miracle come through\nDaddy shooting Craps, tryna win a pair of shoes\nI been growing my hair 'bout to let mommy twist it\nOut wilding with my friends, even got myself a biscuit\nHomie momma smoking with nothing to lose\nNow he stashing cracks in some hundred dollar shoes\nSitting at his crib, smoking Swishers, getting faded\nTold me hit my mommy up, cause he tryna get braided\nWhat we gon' do see the local dope man\nSee if he can put some money in our hand\nSame one jump me, the same one front me\nCause I'm tired of seeing my family fucked up and hungry\nNow I'm in the trap and the devil

and took the bud out the plastic\nFlicking bogey ashes, bitch, I stay blasted\nMicrophone Cassius, Magic with the sick shit\n'Posed to been dead, but bitch, I\u2019m still up in this bitch\nVerbal herbal poison, words I contortion\nFucked a pregnant bitch, she saved money on her ga-bortion\nI feel like Billy Corgan in a church playing organ\nCovering Too Short, smoking a Newport\nKurt hoped the drugs would make the pain go away\nBut all these thoughts up in my head made the sane go astray\nSo step inside the mind that revolves around the rhyme\nAnd every time he close his eyes, visions of white lines\nDying in the arms of a blond, blue-eyed 20-something\nDon\u2019t know her name but the paramedics chest-pumping\n\"30 something black male, OD'ed off of pills\nThat he wasn\u2019t prescribed, but they took his life\"\nLeft behind a daughter that don\u2019t really even know him\n'Cos her mama thought he wouldn\u2019t make a living off of poems\"\nBut it was a long journey on a rocky road\nHad a hoody on and a jacket in the snow\nWalking in the cold on the way to the studio\nNigga, that was just a couple years ago\nDropped a couple mixtapes on the net\nNiggas tried to front like it wasn\u2019t all that\nBut guess what, bitch, I\u2019m coming back\nGuess what, bitch, I\u2019m coming back\nSigned to Fool's Gold and everything is all gnarly\nNow these bitches want my number to get up in the party\nCame a long way from extension cords in the window\nBorrow neighbor's power just to plug up the Nintendo\nWhere the ovens never closed and the stoves never off\nEvery winter so

bitch, she saved money on her ga-bortion\nI feel like Billy Corgan in a church playing organ\nCovering Too Short, smoking a Newport\nKurt hoped the drugs would make the pain go away\nBut all these thoughts up in my head made the sane go astray\nSo step inside the mind that revolves around the rhyme\nAnd every time he close his eyes, visions of white lines\nDying in the arms of a blond, blue-eyed 20-something\nDon\u2019t know her name but the paramedics chest-pumping\n\"30 something black male, OD'ed off of pills\nThat he wasn\u2019t prescribed, but they took his life\"\nLeft behind a daughter that don\u2019t really even know him\n'Cos her mama thought he wouldn\u2019t make a living off of poems\"\nBut it was a long journey on a rocky road\nHad a hoody on and a jacket in the snow\nWalking in the cold on the way to the studio\nNigga, that was just a couple years ago\nDropped a couple mixtapes on the net\nNiggas tried to front like it wasn\u2019t all that\nBut guess what, bitch, I\u2019m coming back\nGuess what, bitch, I\u2019m coming back\nSigned to Fool's Gold and everything is all gnarly\nNow these bitches want my number to get up in the party\nCame a long way from extension cords in the window\nBorrow neighbor's power just to plug up the Nintendo\nWhere the ovens never closed and the stoves never off\nEvery winter so cold niggas sleeping wearing scarf\nBut I always tell myself that it's gonna get better\nYou know who you is? You the greatest rapper ever\nSo now the pressure's on, to prove that voice right\nSome people never know they goals, knew mine my whole life\nSo now his turn's up, fixing up to bat\nPitching singles to the label when I used to pitch crack\nI never learned to rap, always knew how\nEver since a nigga 8, knew what I would do now\nWhen I turned 28, they like, \"What you gon' do now?\"\nAnd now a nigga 30, so I don't think they heard me\nThat the last ten years, I been so fucking stressed\nTears in my eyes, let me get this off my chest\nThe thoughts of no success got a nigga chasing

nigga ace the face saw the signs\nMy talent level excel my age\nSo about age 9, knew that I would rock stage\nSo it made me think of grades, sort of like catching AIDS\nDidn't hit class, I wrote in my notepad\nMimic what I heard, got sicker with the verbs\nFigured this the quickest way to get the picket in the 'burbs\nDistribute herb, admit I used to dabble, but dawg\nThe snares a better sound than the gavel\nGot so damn hungry, with work I used to travel\nPackets in some drawers, toothpaste in the packets\nTryna leave my habitat, in ways that I've adapted\nSleep different when you on somebody else's mattress\nMental got scarred, change the pace could be advantage\nEverybody in the D tryna move to Atlanta\n\nClick your seat fool, get ready to ride\nAnd say good bye we 'bout to go past 8 mile\nBrace yourselves only the strong survive\nIf you alive, we 'bout to go past 8 mile\nIts too happy, hope your heater is dated\nAre you ready? we 'bout to go past 8 mile\nTired of hating with the changes I'm making\nI've been waiting just to go past 8 mile\n\nIt's where the line divide, either side, kinda tell get a sense of your pride\nWhere everyone ain't the same, but in the D that's how it is\nHow can you judge one from where one is?\nThe hook be on some other shit, checking our ID's\nHate tela's go back over the 8\nUsed to talk to white girls that I knew I couldn't date\nCause we was outta bounds, if we met either way\nNow tell me what's the call\nWhen we still gotta go over there to hit the mall\nSo I'm a take this d shit far\nI'm the hybrid meaning sun take a hit past ours\nAs the summer's get hotter, winter get colder\nSons get locked, and our daughters having daughters\nFeel its time to speak, before this shit be out of order\nBefore you be the nigga out here begging for

like catching AIDS\nDidn't hit class, I wrote in my notepad\nMimic what I heard, got sicker with the verbs\nFigured this the quickest way to get the picket in the 'burbs\nDistribute herb, admit I used to dabble, but dawg\nThe snares a better sound than the gavel\nGot so damn hungry, with work I used to travel\nPackets in some drawers, toothpaste in the packets\nTryna leave my habitat, in ways that I've adapted\nSleep different when you on somebody else's mattress\nMental got scarred, change the pace could be advantage\nEverybody in the D tryna move to Atlanta\n\nClick your seat fool, get ready to ride\nAnd say good bye we 'bout to go past 8 mile\nBrace yourselves only the strong survive\nIf you alive, we 'bout to go past 8 mile\nIts too happy, hope your heater is dated\nAre you ready? we 'bout to go past 8 mile\nTired of hating with the changes I'm making\nI've been waiting just to go past 8 mile\n\nIt's where the line divide, either side, kinda tell get a sense of your pride\nWhere everyone ain't the same, but in the D that's how it is\nHow can you judge one from where one is?\nThe hook be on some other shit, checking our ID's\nHate tela's go back over the 8\nUsed to talk to white girls that I knew I couldn't date\nCause we was outta bounds, if we met either way\nNow tell me what's the call\nWhen we still gotta go over there to hit the mall\nSo I'm a take this d shit far\nI'm the hybrid meaning sun take a hit past ours\nAs the summer's get hotter, winter get colder\nSons get locked, and our daughters having daughters\nFeel its time to speak, before this shit be out of order\nBefore you be the nigga out here begging for quarters"}}, {"title": "Adderall Admiral", "album": "XXX", "year": "2011-08-15", "lyrics": "Eating on an Adderall, wash it down with alcohol\nWriting holy mackerel, actual or factual\nOut for the capital, matador ya capsules\nHassle the bitch in a castle with the ill grapples\nTackled her asshole, my dick was like a lasso\nFucked her in her mouth she washed it down with Tabasco\n\nYou softer than Flanders' son\nDon't make me put hands on son\nJump niggas like fuck one on one\nUsed to be locked up watching One on One\nYoung Kyla Pratt was looking thick, nigga wanted some\nBut soon as I got out white bitches by the tons\n\nI fuck bad bitches to Stacy Lattisaw\nWhile you niggas got blue balls like a Avatar\nI'm eating caviar in El Salvador\nShe running from my dick like it's a bull and she the matador\nShe a pregnant labrador\nSaid my metaphors are the highest caliber\n\nI spit hard, you Hallmark card poets\nSo many lines, you can bar code it\nShe like to lick it on the head then slow stroke it\nOcean in her panties and I'm 'bout to float through it\nRewind this and just smoke to it", "image":

capsules\nHassle the bitch in a castle with the ill grapples\nTackled her asshole, my dick was like a lasso\nFucked her in her mouth she washed it down with Tabasco\n\nYou softer than Flanders' son\nDon't make me put hands on son\nJump niggas like fuck one on one\nUsed to be locked up watching One on One\nYoung Kyla Pratt was looking thick, nigga wanted some\nBut soon as I got out white bitches by the tons\n\nI fuck bad bitches to Stacy Lattisaw\nWhile you niggas got blue balls like a Avatar\nI'm eating caviar in El Salvador\nShe running from my dick like it's a bull and she the matador\nShe a pregnant labrador\nSaid my metaphors are the highest caliber\n\nI spit hard, you Hallmark card poets\nSo many lines, you can bar code it\nShe like to lick it on the head then slow stroke it\nOcean in her panties and I'm 'bout to float through it\nRewind this and just smoke to it"}}, {"title": "Ain't It Funny", "album": "Atrocity Exhibition", "year": "2016-09-27", "lyrics": "Verbal couture\nParkour\nWith the metaphors\nThe flow house of horror\nDead bolted with metal doors\nGrinch bitch\nSix sense\nWith a nose drip\nMind skydive\nSniffing bumps\nIn the cockpit\nLocksmith of Hip Hop\nAppraisal the wrist watch\nThe rocks bout the size\nAs the teeth in Chris Rock's mouth\nSock out the mic\nPrototype for Adderall\nYour work killing fiends\nCause you cut it with Fentanyl\nSo much coke\nJust to sniff need a ski lift\nFlip your table over\nIf you cut it with the bullshit\nNose bleeds red carpets\nBut it just blend in\nSnapping pictures\nFeeling my chest being sunk in\nLive a fast life\nSeen many die slowly\nUnhappy when they left\nSo I try to seize the moment\n\nFunny how it happens\nWho ever would imagine\nThat joke's on you\nBut Satan the one laughing\n\nAin't it funny how it happens\nAin't it\nAin't it funny how it happens\nAin't it\nAin't it funny how it happens\nAin't it\n\nI can sell honey to a bee\nIn the fall time\nMake trees\nTake back they leaves\nOctopus in a straight jacket\nSavage with bad habits\nBroke serving fiends\nGot rich became a addict\nAin\u2019t it funny how it happens\nWho would ever would imagine\nNose running right now\nCould ya pass me a napkin\nManaged to somehow\nTo have the upper advantage\nPanic when the drugs are gone\nAnd nobody is answering\nAin\u2019t it funny how it happens\nAin't it\nAin't it funny how it happens\nNo way to mask it\nA lot became has beens\nRolling up that 100 dollar bill\nTill they cash in\nThinks it gone last\nGoing too fast\nMan it's fucked up\nAin't it funny how it

need to slow down\nCause you feel yourself crashing\nStaring in the devil face\nBut ya can\u2019t stop laughing\nStaring in the devil face\nBut ya can't stop laughing\nIt\u2019s a living nightmare\nThat most of us might share\nInherited in our blood\nIt's why we stuck in the mud\nCan\u2019t quit the drug use\nOr the alcohol abuse\nEven if I wanted to\nTell you what I\u2019m gonna do\nI\u2019ma wash away my problems\nWith this bottle of Henny\nAnxiety got the best of me\nSo popping them Xannies\nMight need rehab\nBut to me that shit pussy\nPray for me y\u2019all\nCause I don't know what coming to me\nBought a 8 ball of coke\nAnd my nigga on the way\nGot 3 hoes with him\nAnd they all tryna play\n\nAin't it funny how it happens\nWho ever would imagine\nJokes on you\nBut Satan

bumps\nIn the cockpit\nLocksmith of Hip Hop\nAppraisal the wrist watch\nThe rocks bout the size\nAs the teeth in Chris Rock's mouth\nSock out the mic\nPrototype for Adderall\nYour work killing fiends\nCause you cut it with Fentanyl\nSo much coke\nJust to sniff need a ski lift\nFlip your table over\nIf you cut it with the bullshit\nNose bleeds red carpets\nBut it just blend in\nSnapping pictures\nFeeling my chest being sunk in\nLive a fast life\nSeen many die slowly\nUnhappy when they left\nSo I try to seize the moment\n\nFunny how it happens\nWho ever would imagine\nThat joke's on you\nBut Satan the one laughing\n\nAin't it funny how it happens\nAin't it\nAin't it funny how it happens\nAin't it\nAin't it funny how it happens\nAin't it\n\nI can sell honey to a bee\nIn the fall time\nMake trees\nTake back they leaves\nOctopus in a straight jacket\nSavage with bad habits\nBroke serving fiends\nGot rich became a addict\nAin\u2019t it funny how it happens\nWho would ever would imagine\nNose running right now\nCould ya pass me a napkin\nManaged to somehow\nTo have the upper advantage\nPanic when the drugs are gone\nAnd nobody is answering\nAin\u2019t it funny how it happens\nAin't it\nAin't it funny how it happens\nNo way to mask it\nA lot became has beens\nRolling up that 100 dollar bill\nTill they cash in\nThinks it gone last\nGoing too fast\nMan it's fucked up\nAin't it funny how it happens\n\nAin't it funny how it happens\nAin't it\nAin't it funny how it happens\nAin't it\nAin't it funny how it happens\nAin't it\nAin't it funny how it happen\n\nUpcoming heavy traffic\nSay ya need to slow down\nCause you feel yourself crashing\nStaring in the devil face\nBut ya can\u2019t stop laughing\nStaring in the devil face\nBut ya can't stop laughing\nIt\u2019s a living nightmare\nThat most of us might share\nInherited in our blood\nIt's why we stuck in the mud\nCan\u2019t quit the drug use\nOr the alcohol abuse\nEven if I wanted to\nTell you what I\u2019m gonna do\nI\u2019ma wash away my problems\nWith this bottle of Henny\nAnxiety got the best of me\nSo popping them Xannies\nMight need rehab\nBut to me that shit pussy\nPray for me y\u2019all\nCause I don't know what coming to me\nBought a 8 ball of coke\nAnd my nigga on the way\nGot 3 hoes with him\nAnd they all tryna play\n\nAin't it funny how it happens\nWho ever would imagine\nJokes on you\nBut Satan the one laughing\n\nAin't it funny how it happens\nAin't it\nAin't it funny how it happens\nAin't it\nAin't it funny how it happens\nAin't it"}}, {"title": "Atrocity Exhibition [Artwork]",

nigga\nKnock out ya grill like you was chewin' loads of peanut brittle\nBitch look like she seen a whistle\nWanna' slurp and lick on me like I'm some sort of popsicle (popsicle)\nTickle me she said I look like Snoop Dizzle\nAsked me if I wanted head I said \"Fo' shizzle nizzle'\nBack up on my grizzle grizzle, pistol and an instrumental\nThis a detrimental utter lack of fundamentals\nYou ain't never seen probation, you ain't never seen parole\nI rock 'em, sock 'em robot nigga\nKeep it moving, toe to toes, broke the mould, poke your holes\nPoke your nose and polar flows\nTwist a nigga leave him salty like a bag of Rold Gold\n44 cold blows, all it took was low blows\nNow a nigga fucked up morning toilet seat cold\nUsed to be fucked up rocks in dunta-dun-daduns\nEnd of money credit living waiting on the first to come\nNigga I will run up on (?)\nNow you got tubes in your mouth, Roger Troutman\nNigga you ain't got a choice, used to sound like Barry White\nNow it's T-Pain voice\nBut where Berry Gordy used to crack the top 40's\nNow we crack 40's telling yesterday's stories\nEenie-meenie-minie-mo, been on the Calico\nIn results of taddle-toe\nJump (?) from Mighty Joe\nHidey-hidey-hidey-ho\nCab Calloway ya ho\n'Bout doe, if you ain't about money what you came for?\nSurgery with chainsaws, nigga I will bang y'all\nCatch a nigga Christmas Eve, head leaking Eggnog\nBite a nigga jaw off, while I got the sawed-off\nBecause you ass and pussy like a bitch with her drawers off"}}, {"title": "Blunt After Blunt", "album": "XXX", "year": "2011-08-15", "lyrics":

to\nCame up and act like he ain't even know my dude\nHe feeling better, wanna smoke dude\nTold my nigga \"chill and just do what you supposed to\"\nGet a job like you 'posed to\nRunning round wild talking like he ain't 'posed to\nSaid he'd rather be in jail\nMost these niggas pussies can't survive in the cell\nBiggest downfall, he had a big mouth\nCos niggas hit him up in front of his mom's house\nAnd that's real life drama\nNow I feel bad when I look at his momma\nWish I could take it all back\nBut I wonder what he did to make it end like that\n x2\nLike a boomerang\nWhat you do come back, what you do come back\nWhat you do come back, what you do come back\nWhat you do come back, what you do come back\n\nHot summer day in the motor city\nPosted in the hood, all of my niggas with me\nChevy trunk bang so much bass, no lyrics\nCelebrate the day my man got turned to a spirit\nGan in the air, Henny in the kidney\nBarbecue going, kid's throwing frisbees\nRim in the street, dice game going\nBitches with the short shorts, ass cheeks showing\nBalloons in the air, rocking R.I.P. shirts\nBaby mom got a tat to prove what he was worth\nSun shining feeling like a holiday\nTil niggas pulled up let the whole damn block spray\nAnd that's the end of every function\nDue to all the stress, and the alcohol consumption\nWhat goes around, comes around\nIn a system that's designed to keep

started fucking with his friends\nTook his son out the D, he won't see him again\nLet's go\n\nMom made me smoke swisher with the incense\nSip a little bit, just to get a little bent\nThis nigga that he used to front work to\nCame up and act like he ain't even know my dude\nHe feeling better, wanna smoke dude\nTold my nigga \"chill and just do what you supposed to\"\nGet a job like you 'posed to\nRunning round wild talking like he ain't 'posed to\nSaid he'd rather be in jail\nMost these niggas pussies can't survive in the cell\nBiggest downfall, he had a big mouth\nCos niggas hit him up in front of his mom's house\nAnd that's real life drama\nNow I feel bad when I look at his momma\nWish I could take it all back\nBut I wonder what he did to make it end like that\n x2\nLike a boomerang\nWhat you do come back, what you do come back\nWhat you do come back, what you do come back\nWhat you do come back, what you do come back\n\nHot summer day in the motor city\nPosted in the hood, all of my niggas with me\nChevy trunk bang so much bass, no lyrics\nCelebrate the day my man got turned to a spirit\nGan in the air, Henny in the kidney\nBarbecue going, kid's throwing frisbees\nRim in the street, dice game going\nBitches with the short shorts, ass cheeks showing\nBalloons in the air, rocking R.I.P. shirts\nBaby mom got a tat to prove what he was worth\nSun shining feeling like a holiday\nTil niggas pulled up let the whole damn block spray\nAnd that's the end of every function\nDue to all the stress, and the alcohol consumption\nWhat goes around, comes

while I'm kissing on your neck\nThing getting hard while I'm rubbing on your breasts\nGirl, you make me wanna do things, when you grind all on that ding-a-ling\nMake me wanna rip off your pants, put

Bill Murray, that's a whole 'nother story\nWhat a nightmare, when you see talking to your chick\nPut this in your nose, ho, then start sniffing\nPut this on your tongue, ho, then start licking\nY'all niggas shrooming, y'all better fall back\nAnd my loud got niggas go *clap-clap*\nAin't no time to be playing, spit champagne when you hear what I'm saying\nExhale kush when I breathe on the mic, everytime I rock like a diamond heist\nDrop the lights when I drop the jewel, roll up bush and call it blue groovy\nI'm just tryna say bring it back, drop it down and go *clap-clap*\n\nWith that work, we make it twerk, don't end up on your homeboy's shirt\nCause you popped you a pill, now you feeling like a ho, now go berserk\nI'm just tryna see her shake it, shake it, don't stop girl, just break it, break it\nStick it out, then bring it back, make that booty go *clap-clap*\n\n(Go, go, go, go, go, go)\nDon't stop 'til you break it, break it\n(Go, go, go, go, go, go)\nDon't stop 'til you break it, break it\n\nGirl, just give me your all\nGirl, just give me your all\nGirl, just give me your all\nHell no, you can't have it all\n\nShe had me on that wall, drink in my hand with her ass on my balls\nSweating, hot, and we rolling, phone off service, got a couple missed calls\nGirl, don't stop just get it, get it, after this, ho, I'mma lick it, lick it\nRubbing on your stomach while I'm kissing on your neck\nThing getting hard while I'm rubbing on your breasts\nGirl, you make me wanna do things, when you grind all on that ding-a-ling\nMake me wanna rip off your pants, put my hand between your legs\nRubbing on them nipples, wanna make that pussy dribble\nWanna bend that ass over then hit it from the back\nGirl make that booty go *clap-clap*\n\nWith that work, we make it twerk,

next summer won\u2019t be talking bout next summer\nYo bitch is a runner, my niggas had fun with her\nDid the whole team and heard you put a gun to her\nHomie that ain't pimpin, soft hearted for these

suburb hoes\nExpensive perfume and some new old clothes\nCuss it ain't high end, ain't gotta be vintage\nShe buy her own drinks and week supply of spinach\n(Verse 2: Daniel Sewell)\nNow baby break it down just to build it back up\nCopped a couple pounds, then help me bag it up\nA pill and a half now a nigga acting up...\nDrunk too much, now a nigga throwing up\nBut that was last night, nigga I\u2019m still drinking\nSmoking on the purple got a nigga pupil shrinking\nPlotting on a Lincoln, get it with the ink pin\nYou Fucking with me, my nigga what you thinking\nYour bars too immature this is grown man flow\nAnd that\u2019s why my bitches grown with some grown man dough\nYou\u2019re fucking with them youngins, on the phone with them hoes\nI text a bitch a message now she knockin' at the door\nNaw that\u2019s the pill man, let me get four\nI swear this the last time, I won\u2019t do it no more\nBut said that last week, and now a nigga back\nFuck it, It ain\u2019t like a nigga smoking

offa Blow, nodding while he standing up\nMinute\u2019s been stuck like he picking something up\nRolling up the swisher with the sac under my nuts\nWhile I\u2019m puffin on a Lucie, talkin bout the latest truck\nAnd Hi (how) ima come up and get one next summer\nSo next summer won\u2019t be talking bout next summer\nYo bitch is a runner, my niggas had fun with her\nDid the whole team and heard you put a gun to her\nHomie that ain't pimpin, soft hearted for these hoes\nI feeds em lots of pills, and put coke up in they nose\nGo to thrift stores, drop a buck on t-shirts\nLines in the dressing room then she bought a cheap purse\nStraight up out the hut with some suburb hoes\nExpensive perfume and some new old clothes\nCuss it ain't high end, ain't gotta be vintage\nShe buy her own drinks and week supply of spinach\n(Verse 2: Daniel Sewell)\nNow baby break it down just to build it back up\nCopped a couple pounds, then help me bag it up\nA pill and a half now a nigga acting up...\nDrunk too much, now a nigga throwing up\nBut that was last night, nigga I\u2019m still drinking\nSmoking on the purple got a nigga pupil shrinking\nPlotting on a Lincoln, get it with the ink pin\nYou Fucking with me, my nigga what you thinking\nYour bars too immature this is grown man flow\nAnd that\u2019s why my bitches grown with some grown man dough\nYou\u2019re fucking with them youngins, on the phone with them hoes\nI text a bitch a message now she knockin' at the door\nNaw that\u2019s the pill man, let me get four\nI swear this the last time, I won\u2019t do it no more\nBut said that last week, and now a nigga back\nFuck it, It ain\u2019t like a nigga smoking crack"}}, {"title": "Bruiser Brigade", "album": "XXX", "year": "2011-08-15", "lyrics": "Bruiser!

catch the bus to Great Lakes\nToo many hoes on me man dog I know they fake\nCause where were your hoes at\nWhen I was tapping hoes and they couldn't even look back\nI rather just kickback\nAnd fuck with wifey\nRock heels she don't fuck with nikes\nShe say papi put it all inside me\nAnd I don't do shit lay back and let her ride me\n(Hook)\nLook how it all can change\nThings change start getting

you changed your life\nChanged your car\nChanged your crib\nChanged your wife\nHow the fuck can I act funny\nFar as I know I ain't never been bummy\nAnd these bitches can't change me\nBaby momma shot

you know I'm so hood\nShould have been God merc\nBut I'm fighting in the D like Emanuel Steward\nNiggas see you and won't say two words\nBut when your ass die they want to say a few words\nAnd my real niggas I'll take a case for\nCock back drop back I'll take a face full\nNiggas fake ain't no pride no more\nWonder why these real niggas won't ride no more\n(Hook)\nLook how it all can change\nThings

don't eat\nIce melting in the grand cru\nToo high for rude comments\nI look down on you\nI'm humble and too nice\nBut I don't talk to no Nigga that can't look me in my eyes\nSmoke a newport and take a shit\nAnd text your bitch\nShe know she really want it\nI'm just trying to crash the boards like udonis\nBlow some chronic now she all up on it\nUsed to catch the bus to Great Lakes\nToo many hoes on me man dog I know they fake\nCause where were your hoes at\nWhen I was tapping hoes and they couldn't even look back\nI rather just kickback\nAnd fuck with wifey\nRock heels she don't fuck with nikes\nShe say papi put it all inside me\nAnd I don't do shit lay back and let her ride me\n(Hook)\nLook how it all can change\nThings change start getting some change\nSame friends used to ask for change\nA straight change cause they say you changed\nAnd now look how it all can change\nIt feels strange when they say you changed\nBut think about it man you changed your life\nChanged your car\nChanged your crib\nChanged your wife\nHow the fuck can I act funny\nFar as I know I ain't never been bummy\nAnd these bitches can't change me\nBaby momma shot a mood\nSo I treat 'em al the same\nI don't share things got my own lane\nNiggas in he hood call me by my government name\nRespected in the D used to hustle on 12th street\nAnd I'm from Linwood\nSo you know I'm so hood\nShould have been God merc\nBut I'm fighting in the D like Emanuel Steward\nNiggas see you and won't say two words\nBut when your ass die they want to say a few words\nAnd my real niggas I'll take a case for\nCock back drop back I'll take a face full\nNiggas fake ain't no pride no more\nWonder why these real niggas won't ride no more\n(Hook)\nLook how it all can change\nThings change start getting some change\nSame friends used to ask for change\nA straight change cause they say you changed\nLook how it all can change\nIt feels strange when they say you changed\nBut think about it man you changed in life\nChanged your car\nChanged your crib\nChanged your wife"}}, {"title": "Clean Up", "album": "Old ", "year": "2013-09-30", "lyrics": "No matter how much I implore\n\nThe thoughts are

16 from the slums\nStreet light reflect off the barrel of the gun\nWe expect death, lucky to reach puberty\nLearned in the streets public school wasn't teaching me\nGraduate with honours as a cocaine scholar\nI sell nouns like pounds, birds like birds\nClowns ain't heard, words I serve\nSpit like nicks, rhyme like dimes\nRoll a dollar bill up snort these lines\nFresh off the curb on a quest for the bacon\nFlip an occupation on the final destination\nDaily operation, currency chasing\nGot no patience\nDaily operation, currency chasing\nGot no patience for the pennies I ain't waiting\nPockets getting fatter because the poetry progressed\nWithout a harness on on the ladder of success\n in the chest, brew in the belly\nLiquor in the kidney counting money in the tele"}}, {"title": "Contra",

been painted on\nJeans fitting like they was made for me\nYour pants looking like, they was hand-me-downs from your Daddy\nGet at me, my fit worth a stacky\nI'm in a Caddy getting head in the back seat\nRubbing on her yakki\nThen it start raining, when I start cumming\nSo now I'm brainstorming, on how I'm gon' run it\nAnd y'all like fags \u2013 pussy? You don't want it\nGosh darn it, got heat like furnace\nAnd I raise it like thermostat\nRolling that Thundercat kush look like Panthro\nHeard you grab your ankles, take it in your manhole\nThat's so disgusting, I think I just threw up in my mouth\nCan somebody pass me a towel?\nA wetnap or something? Nigga is you fronting?\nI beat you in your face, now your head like a pumpkin\nJack-o-Lantern, I'm Danny Tanner\nWatching that white girl, you a dry jheri curl\nYou worthless piece of shit\nYour baby mama begged me to suck my dick\nAnd I ain't gon' let her, she look like Predator\nYou a gay boy like David Archuleta\nContra, where niggas pierce armor\nIt's two niggas, two guns, blowing out your conscience\nYou see them chrome 44's, in this bitch with thirty men\nY'all niggas know the code like..\n\nUp-Up, Down-Down\nLeft-Right, Left-Right\nB-A, B-A, Select-Start\n\nWhen I write y'all, I blackout like nightfall\nI'm never shitted on like that flight stall, that's quite small\nYou wouldn't like me when I get gutter, it's the legit cutter\nAnd you ain't sharp enough to split butter\nI stack riches, throwing niggas in black ditches\nYou wack which is why you mixed up like when the track switches\nHand on my nuts like my sac itches\nLooking like The Mack, hitting 'lac switches\nHiding guns in my Abercrombie\nWith a dime piece, getting more brain than a zombie\nTimes 3, Ladies Love Cool J\nI need a bitch with more class than a school day\nI heard a fool say I wasn't in his top 3\nStepped off with a broke arm and a popped knee\nSee me and Brown is no regular team\nWe make the whole planet flip like Omega Supreme\nYeah, make 'em hype, yo I murder with this tight flow\nYou a typo, plus you suck like lypo\nI keep bodies hid, fuck a John Gotti bid\nTalk money, then we can chop it up like the Karate Kid\nBut don't think I won't clap and merk 'em\nInfrared, beam 'em up, I will Captain Kirk 'em\nAnd turn 'em to a brainless dodo\nAnd break 'em both, legs one and two, like when Kane was solo\nI'm snatching up his chains and Polo, the flow's fitted\nTo pose with it in the strangest photo\nI'm bumping blue genie, if your stacks is too teeny\nFirst you see me, and then you don't like I'm Houdini, nigga", "image":

bitch, like I got four nuts\nSo when I wet them bitches, swing like nunchucks\nCame a long way from getting jumped by Chemp\nChopping up white like Stefan Grendt\nFlow like a champ, way ahead of my peers\nAnd again I smoke strong, like Stevie Wonder's ears\nIm in the cutty, with the money on my mind\nFinger on the trigger, hand on my nine\nSo I can't afford time\nBut I got the AP of the fruity lemon line\n\nAnd I ain't too tough to dance\nLet me adjust this heater\nBulging out of my pants\nFirst I step to the left\nThen I step to the right\nThen you drop it down low\nBring it back, ight? (Hey!)\n\nFive, six, seven to eight\n'Bout to slide on you hoes, just like home plate\nI get brain early, that mean I think first\nYou draw last, you paint a picture of a black hearse\nFuck what you think, I'm 'bout that bank\nStones like the button of your Marvis Tanks\nTop full clip, and your bitch on my dick\nCause you're broke like looses, in your pants pocket\nIt barely sit above the rim\nAnd I wore gats like bass heads pull on strings\nMe and my man, two guns like contra\nKeep your bitch, she looks like My Pet Monster\nLame nigga, got no choice but to trick\nProbably could fuck a blind ugly bitch\nI can't get enough of these hoes\nGrab my hand and walk me straight to the dance floor\n\nAnd I ain't too tough to dance\nLet me adjust this heater\nBulging out of my pants\nFirst I step to the left\nThen I step to the right\nThen you drop it down low\nBring it back, ight? (Hey!)\n\nY'all niggas see how easy that was?\nI don't think they know man\nLupido sounds nigga\nIt's official now\nNick's beat nigga\nIt's Danny Brown nigga, y'all know what it is\nDetroit stand up!"}}, {"title": "Dance in the Water", "album": "Atrocity Exhibition", "year": "2016-09-27", "lyrics": "Can you work it\nCan you work it\nBreak it down\nAnd just drop it low\nYou deserve it\nYou deserve it\nGet it out\nAnd let it all go\nShake it\nDon\u2019t break it\nBend over\nAnd touch yo toes\nYou been waiting\nYou been waiting\nReal playa\nGet down on the floor\nI know lately I know lately\nYou been feeling\nLike you wanna let loose\nNo debating\nNo debating\nDo your thing\nAnd just do you\nNo hating\nNo hating\nWhatever it's\nAll on you\nPut it on me\nPut it on me\nLemme tell ya\nWhat we gon' do\n\nDance in the water\nAnd not get wet\nNot get wet\nNot get wet\nDance in the water\nAnd not get wet\nNot get wet\nNot get wet\nDance in the water\nAnd not get wet\nNot get wet\nNot get wet\nDance in the water\nAnd not get wet\nNot get wet\nNot get wet\n\nIs you wit it\nIs you wit it\nLemme see you just\nGet get get it\nGet busy\nGet busy\nBack it up\nAnd just quit playing wit me\nIf you want it\nIf you want it\nIt\u2019s all yours then\nGone head and own it\nWhen you get it\nWhen you get it\nGo and give it to em right\nCause you earned it\nHere we go now\nHere we go now\nDon\u2019t stop what you\u2019re doing\nDon\u2019t slow down\nGone take that\nGone take that\nLike P.

Mile players\nEast don\u2019t like the West, the West say the East is some haters\nGator haven, old school whips, chrome plated\nColor-coordinated fabrics, Cartier glasses, yes!\nIt's the home of them dudes that's fantastic, yes!\nThey'll bust in your attic and start blasting\nLooking for that ganj' you better have it fast\nBitch-ass, we ask last and then smash\nPass the cops, I don't give a fuck I'm playin'\nConscious niggas hold pistols in Detroit\nThis ain't Orange County, nigga, this is Detroit\nAnd I'm a D-boy I'm building the \"estroy\"\nHome of the Lords and the motherfucking Cheddar Boys\nHex murderer, trick-trick\nWe click-click, boom\nAnd let the pistols clear the room, I assume\nCome to my city, you better holla\nOr watch out for my niggas creeping in Impalas\n\nWe're some D-Boyz, D-Boyz, D-Boyz\nYou probably wouldn't get it if you come from out of town\nWe're some D-Boyz, D-Boyz, D-Boyz\nWe're getting all the paper, man, we're spreading it around\nWe're some D-Boyz, D-Boyz, D-Boyz\nThey call us Jenny Craig the way my niggas move pounds\nWe're some D-Boyz, D-Boyz, D-Boyz\nWe shoot this fucker up and make a nigga run a mile\nWe're some D-Boyz, D-Boyz, D-Boyz\n\nAnd we roll deep, ask some motherfucker about we\nWe on our feet\nSorry,  got me acting rowdy\nJust enough Bacardi but this is how we party\nProbably step in the joint for some Henny and some Coke\nPart of my code, I prolly got a nina in my coat\nGucci ... heads up on my toe, I'm a goat\nPlus the cash that I throw is like it never touch the floor\n Yeah, such a professional\nThe blow and the 'dro in the floor near the dresser drawer\nTake us as jealous, ho, dare you to touch it, though\nViolence start piling we ain't smilin'\nDon't you hear them violins, somebody must have died and\nNobody couldn't survive that moment of silence, uh\n\nGot my D fitted like Magnum PI\nKeep the Big Mac on me, for you small fries\nBlowing on haze, four deep in the Mercury\nY'all niggas gay like Eddie Mercury\nBaby momma going down slow Ron Burgundy\nForty cal. wake niggas early like courtesy calls\nY'all on my balls like Pilate class\nShotty blast, ring of fire, like Johnny Cash\nI don't eat rappers, I eat baby mommas\nYou at Mickey D's while we at Benihana's\nEvery time you call she tell you \"low cell\"\nAnd when you call back it's straight voice mail\nCause she's with the G's, me and T3\nEspy, Nudie Jeans, you look tacky\nY'all fake like Jackie\nTalkin' 'bout murder but we know you just rapping\nTalking gun play, but you never made it happen\nTalking 'bout work, but your never sold a capsule\nNow, is it just me or these niggas bars gay like that one on Police Academy\nActually, these niggas just dumb\nHoes in the village when we walk through the slums\nWhere me and 3 from, keep a gat\nSo I guess that's where you at\n\n\nI dare you come on, yo\nOne, two\nAnd we're killing this rap shit\nBlack Milk, Guilty Simpson, yeah, Slum Village, Elzhi, yeah\nYou know how we're doing this shit, fat cat\nOne, two, Detroit", "image": "https://images.genius.com/37d30cd61cc10b6c59d5e0defc23e542.500x500x1.jpg", "artist": "Danny Brown", "raw": {"annotation_count": 24, "api_path":

beware of 7 Mile players\nEast don\u2019t like the West, the West say the East is some haters\nGator haven, old school whips, chrome plated\nColor-coordinated fabrics, Cartier glasses, yes!\nIt's the home of them dudes that's fantastic, yes!\nThey'll bust in your attic and start blasting\nLooking for that ganj' you better have it fast\nBitch-ass, we ask last and then smash\nPass the cops, I don't give a fuck I'm playin'\nConscious niggas hold pistols in Detroit\nThis ain't Orange County, nigga, this is Detroit\nAnd I'm a D-boy I'm building the \"estroy\"\nHome of the Lords and the motherfucking Cheddar Boys\nHex murderer, trick-trick\nWe click-click, boom\nAnd let the pistols clear the room, I assume\nCome to my city, you better holla\nOr watch out for my niggas creeping in Impalas\n\nWe're some D-Boyz, D-Boyz, D-Boyz\nYou probably wouldn't get it if you come from out of town\nWe're some D-Boyz, D-Boyz, D-Boyz\nWe're getting all the paper, man, we're spreading it

D-Boyz, D-Boyz, D-Boyz\n\nAnd we roll deep, ask some motherfucker about we\nWe on our feet\nSorry,  got me acting rowdy\nJust enough Bacardi but this is how we party\nProbably step in the joint for some Henny and some Coke\nPart of my code, I prolly got a nina in my coat\nGucci ... heads up on my toe, I'm a goat\nPlus the cash that I throw is like it never touch the floor\n Yeah, such a professional\nThe blow and the 'dro in the floor near the dresser drawer\nTake us as jealous, ho, dare you to touch it, though\nViolence start piling we ain't smilin'\nDon't you hear them violins, somebody must have died and\nNobody couldn't survive that moment of silence, uh\n\nGot my D fitted like Magnum PI\nKeep the Big Mac on me, for you small fries\nBlowing on haze, four deep in the Mercury\nY'all niggas gay like Eddie Mercury\nBaby momma going down slow Ron Burgundy\nForty cal. wake niggas early like courtesy calls\nY'all on my balls like Pilate class\nShotty blast, ring of fire, like Johnny Cash\nI don't eat rappers, I eat baby mommas\nYou at Mickey D's while we at Benihana's\nEvery time you call she tell you \"low cell\"\nAnd when you call back it's straight voice mail\nCause she's with the G's, me and T3\nEspy, Nudie Jeans, you look tacky\nY'all fake like Jackie\nTalkin' 'bout murder but we know you just rapping\nTalking gun play, but you never made it happen\nTalking 'bout work, but your never sold a capsule\nNow, is it just me or these niggas bars gay like that one on Police Academy\nActually, these niggas just dumb\nHoes in the village when we walk through the slums\nWhere me and 3 from, keep a gat\nSo I guess that's where you at\n\n\nI dare you come on, yo\nOne, two\nAnd we're killing this rap shit\nBlack Milk, Guilty Simpson, yeah, Slum

female MC and a pop artist\nOh baby, I like it raw\nAnd my dick so big left stretch marks on her jaw\n\nI'm so institutionalized\nI wake up 6 a.m. because I think it's chow time\nBorderline porcupine, a step from drinking turpentine\nJust to wash down a plate of wack rappers rhymes\nI got a mind in the cosmos\nAnd if these niggas cold then I guess I'm osmosis\nThat be blowing on some potent, that

life\n\nBuzzing off the barbiturates and amphetamines\nChase it with a 40 Oz of Ready Clean\nI swear I never ever smoke the better weed\nYour bitch said I'm the swaggiest nigga she ever seen\nRun up in your crib, two K's, one mag\nYour girl get snatched like Cool J in I'm Bad\nCost to live, you ain't made enough\nGuarantee bullet holes with a laser touch\nEuropean garments drape my body if I ain't hipstered up\nIf she smile with eye contact then the bitch will fuck\nHomie gon' make me send them killers after him\nThem niggas swing swords like World Fence Champions\nYou was popping pills and drinking liquor\nNow you thinking you a gangsta killer\nI leave you stanking nigga, laid down\nFace down like you taking a planking picture\nBut I can keep the shots in the weapon\nPut the bat to

dropped\nAnd my name was Michael J. Fox\nBut no bitch, it's Danny Brown, I've got some weed up in my sock\nSo bitch get high with ya nigga\nThe sack I got is looking like some green caterpillars\nBut it smell like a skunk that's oh so defensive\nThese bitches suck my dick like it was moral incentive\nI'm off the chain like broke nunchucks\nFrom where these little niggas try to shoot you off that new Chucks\nA little dark like wet nubuck\nDecribes my state of mind is inside the tomb of King Tut\nMurders all the time is all I see\nDetroit 187 on you niggas TV\nAnd I can first agree this beat kill a nigga no charges\nFuck a female MC and a pop artist\nOh baby, I like it raw\nAnd my dick so big left stretch marks on her jaw\n\nI'm so institutionalized\nI wake up 6 a.m. because I think it's chow time\nBorderline porcupine, a step from drinking turpentine\nJust to wash down a plate of wack rappers rhymes\nI got a mind in the cosmos\nAnd if these niggas cold then I guess I'm osmosis\nThat be blowing on some potent, that these white boys be growing\nWhile you niggas smoking something smelling like a tanning lotion\nMy concoctions could make world ending potions\nThese other rap niggas got lines I got encroachments\nI get endorsements, so motherfuck your co-sign\nPunch punchlines I'll punch rappers 'til your broke spine\n'member back in '09, I told 'em it was showtime\nNow they pull they cam phones out when I go for mine\nLight camera action, Hybrid be snapping\nCause the days of no tissue had to wipe with wet napkins\nSmear up the classifieds know it sound trife\nBut to be honest a metaphor for my life\n\nBuzzing off the barbiturates and amphetamines\nChase it with a 40 Oz of Ready Clean\nI swear I never ever smoke the better weed\nYour bitch said I'm the swaggiest nigga she ever seen\nRun up in your crib, two K's, one mag\nYour girl get snatched like Cool J in I'm Bad\nCost to live, you ain't made enough\nGuarantee bullet holes with a laser touch\nEuropean garments drape my body if I ain't hipstered up\nIf she smile with eye contact then the bitch will fuck\nHomie gon' make me send them killers after him\nThem niggas swing swords like World Fence Champions\nYou was popping pills and drinking liquor\nNow you thinking you a gangsta killer\nI leave you stanking nigga, laid down\nFace down like you taking a planking picture\nBut I can keep the shots in the weapon\nPut the bat to back of your leg\nGrab your chin and the back of your head\nAnd twist them shits in opposite directions"}}, {"title": "Detroit State of Mind Pt. 2", "album": "It's a Art", "year": "2010-01-01", "lyrics": "Roaches crawlin' up the wall, piss-stained beds\nNiggas dreamin' 'bout piff, but we rolling up reg\nStill scream, though his momma say, \"never leave the backyard\"\nNiggas out shooting, used condoms on the playground\nStay 'round crackheads, squatting out vacant flats\nTeen girls getting raped, man it's all fact\nHooks swoop up, take your money and your crack\nMight get your weed back, put your ass out the back\nStarvin', narcs comin' we chalking\nRun up, stash the work, get the guns out the closet\nSeen niggas in the county get they brains stomped out\nWhile the dep's did nothing they just stood there and watched\nTired of Coney, motor city got me lonely\nFor security, I got the .40 on me\nCrib's rent unpaid, bills in the mailbox\nLetter from your cousin on the bloc, man it stay hot\nMost niggas I grew up with that are locked up\nAre lost to a trap, leave their ass, stuck\nAnd most souls I know got babies or a lady\nNever met a old chick that tell me that she married\nIt's crazy in a city where there's money to gamble\nBut lookin' at the scenery, it's all in shambles\nI lay back, reminisce on earlier times\nThere's nothing happy here, it's a Detroit state of mind\n\nWhen the moon come out, and the sun don't shine\nI be on the corner all day continuing the grind\nWhen the sun comes up that just let me know the time\nThere's nothing happy here, it's a Detroit state of mind\n\nAt the Cabernet, late night, saturday\nTight fitted, drunk off hennessey, I put the gat away\nI'm nervous 'bout it cause these niggas lookin' kinda strange\nAs I have them very thoughts, niggas got it in the brain\nI'm headed for the exit, while I'm slipping on champagne\nKicking bottles on the floor, I'm just trying to hit the door\nAnd everybody else too ain't tryna get trampled\nHeard two shots, tripped, and twisted my ankle\nAnd we can never party, a bunch of hatin' niggas\nIn a city that's corrupted with some grimey-ass bitches\nCould be your best friend or even your relative\nSnitch on you or put the .40 in your grill\nAnd nigga that ain't right, niggas your whole life\nWhen you get locked won't send you a kite\nI lay back, reflect, think of earlier times\nThere's nothing happy here, it's a Detroit state of mind", "image": "https://images.genius.com/407855f5757c95f2b4f06303bad680b5.500x498x1.jpg", "artist": "Danny Brown", "raw":

nothing they just stood there and watched\nTired of Coney, motor city got me lonely\nFor security, I got the .40 on me\nCrib's rent unpaid, bills in the mailbox\nLetter from your cousin on the bloc, man it stay hot\nMost niggas I grew up with that are locked up\nAre lost to a trap, leave their ass, stuck\nAnd most souls I know got babies or a lady\nNever met a old chick that tell me that she married\nIt's crazy in a city where there's money to gamble\nBut lookin' at the scenery, it's all in shambles\nI lay back, reminisce on earlier times\nThere's nothing happy here, it's a Detroit state of mind\n\nWhen the moon come out, and the sun don't shine\nI be on the corner all day continuing the grind\nWhen the sun comes up that just let me know the time\nThere's nothing happy here, it's a Detroit state of mind\n\nAt the Cabernet, late night, saturday\nTight fitted, drunk off hennessey, I put the gat away\nI'm nervous 'bout it cause these niggas lookin' kinda strange\nAs I have them very thoughts, niggas got it in the brain\nI'm headed for the exit, while I'm slipping on champagne\nKicking bottles on the floor, I'm just trying to hit the door\nAnd everybody else too ain't tryna get trampled\nHeard two shots, tripped, and twisted my ankle\nAnd we can never party, a bunch of hatin' niggas\nIn a city that's corrupted with some grimey-ass bitches\nCould be your best friend or even your relative\nSnitch on you or put the .40 in your grill\nAnd nigga that ain't right, niggas your whole life\nWhen you get locked won't send you a kite\nI lay back, reflect, think of earlier times\nThere's nothing happy here, it's a Detroit state of mind"}}, {"title": "Die Like a Rockstar", "album": "XXX", "year": "2011-08-15", "lyrics": "Brown bless the mic like gesundheit\nBud 'bout the

more\nAnd I keep feeling like I'm gon' faint\nBut fuck that, nigga, pass me that drank\nI done drunk too much\nI might throw up in a hotel bathroom sink\nBitch, I'm blown, I'm zooted\nCan't believe

Dance up in the place\nI'm grinding on your bitch\nWhile I'm grinding on my teeth\nDon't give a flying fuck\nSo right now you don't want beef\nI'm blown, I'm zooted\nCan't believe that I'm even

Versace pillowcases\nI ain't smoke an eighth a day, I might end up a mental patient\nTerry cloth bathrobes, blunts and ashtrays\nWhite wine in flute glass, early morning Saturdays\nFood plates and grape Ape, crepes and OJ\nBitches swimming topless in Chlorine off morphine\nEmails on iPads don't answer when phone rings\nText message full coming down on four beans\nEverynight like a bachelor party in Sin City\nBitches sniffing coke off each other titties with rolled 50's\nLife I live like Charlie Sheen and Rick James\nGoing hard 'til it ain't a dollar to my name\nThis that Triple X shit nigga, how ya feel?\nGroupies like glam rock, poison logo pills\nSniffing molly off amps blond haired tramps\nWhen I'm on my way to the stage every night I rage\n\nIt's in my DNA, cause my pops like to get fucked up the same way\nIt's in my DNA, cause my moms like to get fucked up the same way\nDNA, DNA cause my fam like to get fucked up the same way\nDNA, DNA cause my fam like to get fucked up the same way\n\nWarhols all on the wall of the villa\nAdderall popping got me jumping to ceiling\nPerceived as a villian no sentiment in my sentence\nFor instance in instants they'll be calling forensics\nIf incidents occur remember these ain't just words\nGo from talking shit to organs preserved\nYou soft serve rappers just hide behind your reverb\nAnd even without effects you'll end up dessert\nI research and homework, make you dig ya own dirt\nOn beats buried alive, ratting wiseguys\nI'm with a latin bitch, fat ass, well porportioned thighs\nAnd love to see it cumming so I squirt it in her eyes\nI'm hopping out that new shit like narcs on Tuesday\nThe grill on it shiny like LL Cool J's\nWhat's on my waist could make a nigga meet ya doomsday\nTo describe ya mixtape that shit was like a toothache\n\nIt's in my DNA, cause my pops like to get fucked up the same way\nIt's in my DNA, cause my moms like to get fucked up the same way\nDNA, DNA cause my fam like to get fucked up

scraped myself with that razor\nGetting head in that trick house and I snuck out without paying her\nLocked up in that precinct, used my Timberland for a pillow\nBreak the dank in that swizzle, riding 'round in a dope fiend rental\nPulling up on ya baby momma, like bitch what you tryna get into?\nIf you ain't about that sucking, then ho you can keep on trucking\nI'm getting mine straight up, no middle man, nigga I don't like you\nFool's Gold the clique, and musically we don't fuck with you\nWent from holding crack in my ass crack to racks on racks on ASCAP\nCoulda rhymed ASCAP with ass capped, Jadakiss already said that\nDo it for the days when for dinner, all a nigga had to eat was a couple of conies\nBroke as fuck and no bitch will fuck, in my basement, jerking off lonely\nUsed to fall off fucking with the work, but guess what I'm back on ho\nNo more messing on that couch, now I'm all the way in your bitch mouth\nAnd I gag her 'til she cry, on her stomach fluid come up\nI be fucking her face on the daily, you be kissing that bitch in the mouth\n\nLike open wide, ho!\nOpen wide, ho!\nOpen wide, ho!\nJust open wide, ho!\n\nIf I tell a bitch to do a flip in the air\nThen land on my dick from the back\nLook I ain't tripping, no, I ain't kidding\nHave her licking my head like a cat\nNow shut up bitch and get the Amber Rose\nCome and let a young real nigga cut\nBut nah, bitch, this dick ain't free\nSo she copped my dick and then cuffed\nNow come here chick and let me feed you nuts\nCum on her ass and have a lioness\nHow her mouth can be wide as her legs\nMy dick is long as the Brooklyn bridge\nHit it raw cause I'm with the shit\nGave her the pipe, said she need a fix\nGave you life, you can't believe the sight\nTake the wood like a termite\nMade a crash up at the turnpike\nBut it's a rental, I'll get another\nWonder if you got the gift from your mother\nI used to play hoops with your brother\nEven played a lil' house with your sister\nShe always call me daddy or mister mister\nWhy the  can do more than fist her\nToo busy getting head, I ain't never kissed her\nBeat the cheeks, I never missed a beat\nI was screwed up on the couch so I skeet skeet\nHo can make an orgasm last a week\nI'mma get her deep, she a masterpiece\nHell nah I don't love that bitch\nHell yeah, I'm gon' enjoy that bitch\nBut I hope my daughter don't be like this\nBut I know her momma know that shit exist\n\nLike open wide, ho!\nOpen wide, ho!", "image": "https://images.genius.com/f6aee4654acc61ac2fd098ed1e663aa9.1000x1000x1.jpg", "artist": "Danny Brown", "raw":

trick house and I snuck out without paying her\nLocked up in that precinct, used my Timberland for a pillow\nBreak the dank in that swizzle, riding 'round in a dope fiend rental\nPulling up on ya baby momma, like bitch what you tryna get into?\nIf you ain't about that sucking, then ho you can keep on trucking\nI'm getting mine straight up, no middle man, nigga I don't like you\nFool's Gold the clique, and musically we don't fuck with you\nWent from holding crack in my ass crack to racks on racks on ASCAP\nCoulda rhymed ASCAP with ass capped, Jadakiss already said that\nDo it for the days when for dinner, all a nigga had to eat was a couple of conies\nBroke as fuck and no bitch will fuck, in my basement, jerking off lonely\nUsed to fall off fucking with the work, but guess what I'm back on ho\nNo more messing on that couch, now I'm all the way in your bitch mouth\nAnd I gag her 'til she cry, on her stomach fluid come up\nI be fucking her face on the daily, you be kissing that bitch in the mouth\n\nLike open wide, ho!\nOpen wide, ho!\nOpen wide, ho!\nJust open wide, ho!\n\nIf I tell a bitch to do a flip in the air\nThen land on my dick from the back\nLook I ain't tripping, no, I ain't kidding\nHave her licking my head like a cat\nNow shut up bitch and get the Amber Rose\nCome and let a young real nigga cut\nBut nah, bitch, this dick ain't free\nSo she copped my dick and then cuffed\nNow come here chick and let me feed you nuts\nCum on her ass and have a lioness\nHow her mouth can be wide as her legs\nMy dick is long as the Brooklyn bridge\nHit it raw cause I'm with the shit\nGave her the pipe, said she need a fix\nGave you life, you can't believe the sight\nTake the wood like a termite\nMade a crash up at the turnpike\nBut it's a rental, I'll get another\nWonder if you got the gift from your mother\nI used to play hoops with your brother\nEven played a lil' house with your sister\nShe always call me daddy or mister mister\nWhy the  can do more than fist her\nToo busy getting head, I ain't never kissed her\nBeat the cheeks, I never missed a beat\nI was screwed up on the couch so I skeet skeet\nHo can make an orgasm last a week\nI'mma get her deep, she a masterpiece\nHell nah I don't love that bitch\nHell yeah, I'm gon' enjoy that bitch\nBut I hope my daughter don't be like this\nBut I know her momma know that shit exist\n\nLike open wide, ho!\nOpen wide, ho!"}}, {"title": "Downward Spiral", "album": "Atrocity Exhibition", "year": "2016-09-27", "lyrics": "I'm sweating like I\u2019m in a rave\nBeen in this room for 3 days\nThink I\u2019m hearing voices\nParanoid and think I\u2019m seeing ghost-es, oh shit\nPhone keep ringing but I cut that shit off\nOnly time I use it when I tell the dealer drop it off\nHad a threesome last night, ain\u2019t matter what it cost\nCouldn\u2019t it get hard, tried to stuff it in soft\nHad to fuck em both raw, keep my fingers crossed\nBeen grinding on my teeth so long it's swelling up my jaw\nNothing on but my bathrobe and pinky ring\nYour worst nightmare for me is a normal dream\nAnd if I learned anything\nIs don\u2019t nod off with ya motherfucking cigarette burning\nKnocking on my door but I won\u2019t answer\nResidue on mirrors, Jojo dancer\n\nAnd it's a downward spiral\nGotta figure it out (out)\nI gotta figure it out (out)\nI gotta figure it out\nCause it's the downward spiral\nI gotta figure it out (out)\nGotta figure it out (out)\nI gotta figure it out\n\nEverybody say, you got a lot to be proud of\nBeen high this whole time, don\u2019t realize what I done\nCause when I\u2019m all alone, feel like no one care\nIsolate myself and don\u2019t go nowhere\nSmoking blunt after blunt, 'til my eyes start burning\nHennessy straight got my chest like a furnace\nDrowning frustrations in a ocean of sin\nThinking irrational, I have no emotions\nCold cold world, some might say\nFreezing on the snow, brain feel a bit frostbit\nNauseous, don\u2019t know the last time I ate\nBut I eat these fucking rappers like fucking last steak\nOn death row, feel like I am\nYou never know, one day you're here, the next you're gone\nSo I put it all up in these songs...\n\nAnd it's a downward spiral\nGotta figure it out (out)\nI gotta figure it out (out)\nI gotta figure it out\nCause it's the downward spiral\nI gotta figure it out (out)\nGotta figure it out (out)\nI gotta figure it out",

I cut that shit off\nOnly time I use it when I tell the dealer drop it off\nHad a threesome last night, ain\u2019t matter what it cost\nCouldn\u2019t it get hard, tried to stuff it in soft\nHad to fuck em both raw, keep my fingers crossed\nBeen grinding on my teeth so long it's swelling up my jaw\nNothing on but my bathrobe and pinky ring\nYour worst nightmare for me is a normal dream\nAnd if I learned anything\nIs don\u2019t nod off with ya motherfucking cigarette burning\nKnocking on my door but I won\u2019t answer\nResidue on mirrors, Jojo dancer\n\nAnd it's a downward spiral\nGotta figure it out (out)\nI gotta figure it out (out)\nI gotta figure it out\nCause it's the downward spiral\nI gotta figure it out (out)\nGotta figure it out (out)\nI gotta figure it out\n\nEverybody say, you got a lot to be proud of\nBeen high this whole time, don\u2019t realize what I done\nCause when I\u2019m all alone, feel like no one care\nIsolate myself and don\u2019t go nowhere\nSmoking blunt after blunt, 'til my eyes start burning\nHennessy straight got my chest like a furnace\nDrowning frustrations in a ocean of sin\nThinking irrational, I have no emotions\nCold cold world, some might say\nFreezing on the snow, brain feel a bit frostbit\nNauseous, don\u2019t know the last time I ate\nBut I eat these fucking rappers like fucking last steak\nOn death row, feel like I am\nYou never know, one day you're here, the next you're gone\nSo I put it all up in these songs...\n\nAnd it's a downward spiral\nGotta figure it out (out)\nI gotta figure it out (out)\nI gotta figure it out\nCause it's the downward spiral\nI gotta figure it out (out)\nGotta figure it out (out)\nI gotta figure it out"}}, {"title": "Drinks on Me", "album": "The Hybrid ", "year": "2010-03-16", "lyrics": "You got your niece to babysit ya baby\nToes looking right cause early you got a pedi\nYou ain't got a man but you got a baby daddy\nGo out ya way to get drunk at a party every Saturday\nBut who am I to judge, baby? Want another drink?\nTonight give me your brain, you ain't gotta think\nJust let yourself go, tomorrow blame the alcohol\nYou ain't got a job, it ain't like you got a class tomorrow\nFind you a purse to borrow, beats is like your friends\nStart being in thoughts cause the party never ends\nI.D. say 22, shop at Forever 21\nBest friend 30, she's forever 21\nGoing down the same path, take another sip\nPour another glass, take another hit\nI tell you that you're beautiful, your pops never did\nProbably why it ain't a pop around for none of your kids\nSorry for putting out ya biz\nBut right now I can't stop looking at them tits\nAnd grabbing on that ass, filling up the glass\nGet you drunk and fuck you, that's a part of my task\nAnd she really helping, being a real sport about it\nFull cup of Goose, pinch of cran and she allowed it\n20 minutes later, man, she really all about it\n20 minutes later, man, she took a nigga out, kid, drinks on me\n\nPass the designated driver the keys\nAnd don't worry y'all, drinks on me, so have a toast with me\nBring your I.D. hanging with me\nIt's on my tab y'all, drinks on me, so have a toast with me\nHennessey and Grand Cru for me\nI take a sip and say free Max B, so have a drink with me\nSo don't worry y'all, 'bout no fees\nI said I got it y'all, drinks on me, so have a drink with me\n\nSay my auntie sort of like an alcoholic\nBeen drinking since the teens, shitting blood in the toilet\nStarted real young, nigga pushed the bottle on her\nDrunk, fully clothed in tubs, I cut showers on her\nBut I still love her and I live life for her\nShe ask me for a dollar, I'm gon' give it to her\nStay drinking on the brew, keep a can in her hand\nTied grocery bag full of keystone cans\nAlcoholism has poisoned our city\nLiquor store on every corner ain't like that in other cities\nSo you have a drink, take a hit and pass that\nGive a buck to a wino help him buy crack\nDwell on the past, looking towards tomorrow\nWish I could lend my pain, let you borrow my sorrow\nLive where lil' niggas wanna be Chris Partlow\nSay fuck the lotto, buck's on a bottle, drinks on me", "image":

got a pedi\nYou ain't got a man but you got a baby daddy\nGo out ya way to get drunk at a party every Saturday\nBut who am I to judge, baby? Want another drink?\nTonight give me your brain, you ain't gotta think\nJust let yourself go, tomorrow blame the alcohol\nYou ain't got a job, it ain't like you got a class tomorrow\nFind you a purse to borrow, beats is like your friends\nStart being in thoughts cause the party never ends\nI.D. say 22, shop at Forever 21\nBest friend 30, she's forever 21\nGoing down the same path, take another sip\nPour another glass, take another hit\nI tell you that you're beautiful, your pops never did\nProbably why it ain't a pop around for none of your kids\nSorry for putting out ya biz\nBut right now I can't stop looking at them tits\nAnd grabbing on that ass, filling up the glass\nGet you drunk and fuck you, that's a part of my task\nAnd she really helping, being a real sport about it\nFull cup of Goose, pinch of cran and she allowed it\n20 minutes later, man, she really all about it\n20 minutes later, man, she took a nigga out, kid, drinks on me\n\nPass the designated driver the keys\nAnd don't worry y'all, drinks on me, so have a toast with me\nBring your I.D. hanging with me\nIt's on my tab y'all, drinks on me, so have a toast with me\nHennessey and Grand Cru for me\nI take a sip and say free Max B, so have a drink with me\nSo don't worry y'all, 'bout no fees\nI said I got it y'all, drinks on me, so have a drink with me\n\nSay my auntie sort of like an alcoholic\nBeen drinking since the teens, shitting blood in the toilet\nStarted real young, nigga pushed the bottle on her\nDrunk, fully clothed in tubs, I cut showers on her\nBut I still love her and I live life for her\nShe ask me for a dollar, I'm gon' give it to her\nStay drinking on the brew, keep a can in her hand\nTied grocery bag full of keystone cans\nAlcoholism has poisoned our city\nLiquor store on every corner ain't like that in other cities\nSo you have a drink, take a hit and pass that\nGive a buck to a wino help him buy crack\nDwell on the past, looking towards tomorrow\nWish I could lend my pain, let you borrow my sorrow\nLive where lil' niggas wanna be Chris Partlow\nSay fuck the lotto, buck's on a bottle, drinks on me"}}, {"title": "Dubstep", "album": "Old ", "year": "2013-10-08", "lyrics": "I was thinking 'bout something, but I ain't worried 'bout nothing\nRemember when I was struggling, fucked up on my knuckles\nTryna sell some dirt weed, taxing off a ten speed\nMoney wasn't coming, for sure nigga I kept fronting\n\nI had them dubs on the step\nI had them dubs on the step\nI had them dubs on the step\nI had them dubs on the step\nSlow days, fast days, getting paper any way\nSlow days, fast days, getting paper any way\nSlow days, fast days, getting paper any way\nSlow days, fast days, getting paper any way\n\nAnd I kept licking on that clit 'til she gave me that shit\nI've been fucked up for so long, swear to God I gotta get it\nI put my back into it, serving bags to them students\nTell 'em I got that fire on that porch right there by the Buick\nI'm just tryna get my mind, go worry nigga 'bout yours\nRolling up that Swisher, pouring up a four\nServing in them hallways, the courtrooms all day\nHoods kicked the door down, now we in the Coney\n\nI had them dubs on the step\nI had them dubs on the step\nI had them dubs on the step\nI had them dubs on the step\nSlow days, fast days, getting paper any way\nSlow days, fast days, getting paper any way\nSlow days, fast days, getting paper any way\nSlow days, fast days, getting paper any way\n\nIt's the same old shit\nEverybody in the manor is locked up, boxed up\nIt's killing me, niggas wanna get rid of me\nCause I lyrically bust on the riddim, fill the room with humidity\nStick it in a manner, the heaviest rhythm banging out\nDoubling my money getting my hustle in Canning Town\nListen up Danny Brown, I been doing this thing\nSkipped in, then I come and lyrically assist 'em\n(I had my dubs on the step)\nI never stopped cause I sit in the booth, flipping the truth\nWhile you're running and chatting, thinking you're realer than Screw\nYou ain't so why you act, dummy, you think you bad, well that's funny\nI'm tryna get Maybach money, I'm a Mac Miller, spitting A$AP Rocky\n\nI had them

when I was struggling, fucked up on my knuckles\nTryna sell some dirt weed, taxing off a ten speed\nMoney wasn't coming, for sure nigga I kept fronting\n\nI had them dubs on the step\nI had them dubs on the step\nI had them dubs on the step\nI had them dubs on the step\nSlow days, fast days, getting paper any way\nSlow days, fast days, getting paper any way\nSlow days, fast days, getting paper any way\nSlow days, fast days, getting paper any way\n\nAnd I kept licking on that clit 'til she gave me that shit\nI've been fucked up for so long, swear to God I gotta get it\nI put my back into it, serving bags to them students\nTell 'em I got that fire on that porch right there by the Buick\nI'm just tryna get my mind, go worry nigga 'bout yours\nRolling up that Swisher, pouring up a four\nServing in them hallways, the courtrooms all day\nHoods kicked the door down, now we in the Coney\n\nI had them dubs on the step\nI had them dubs on the step\nI had them dubs on the step\nI had them dubs on the step\nSlow days, fast days, getting paper any way\nSlow days, fast days, getting paper any way\nSlow days, fast days, getting paper any way\nSlow days, fast days, getting paper any way\n\nIt's the same old shit\nEverybody in the manor is locked up, boxed up\nIt's killing me, niggas wanna get rid of me\nCause I lyrically bust on the riddim, fill the room with humidity\nStick it in a manner, the heaviest rhythm banging out\nDoubling my money getting my hustle in Canning Town\nListen up Danny Brown, I been doing this thing\nSkipped in, then I come and lyrically assist 'em\n(I had my dubs on the step)\nI never stopped cause I sit in the booth, flipping the truth\nWhile you're running and chatting, thinking you're realer than Screw\nYou ain't so why you act, dummy, you think you bad, well that's funny\nI'm tryna get Maybach money, I'm a Mac Miller, spitting A$AP Rocky\n\nI had them dubs on the step"}}, {"title": "Errthang", "album": "Bruiser Brigade", "year":

with the 4, about last week (?)\nNow I'm in this church with these old dress clothes\nLooking at his sister going crazy on the floor\nFighting back tears kind of wish I was with him\nJump in the casket like take me with him\nAunt sung a song made my eyes tear up\nPalms got sweaty, nostrils flared up\nHad to leave out I was feeling all crazy\nStraight to the face had to blow a blunt of hazy\nNo choice but to hustle\nSeems like every year a nigga lose a couple\n\nI look around and (everybody's gone)\nI look around and (everybody's gone)\nSay your RIP to the dearly departed\nSay your

me Bel-Air Shopping Center\nThe West side, these niggas call me Green Field Plaza\nYou ain't got no connect nigga, you copping from El Blaga\nContinue on the saga, your mouth is Fierce as Sasha\nMaking millions off the girls, I'm Beyonce's father\nI'm sitting in the Charger, you niggas Lady Gaga\nLeft my car charger, CD changer no Carter\nDwayne or Shawn, Sean Price mixed with Lil' Jon\nOff the fifth of rum, piff in my lungs\nFucking two Asian bitches 'til they couldn't cum\nAnd when them hoes squirt it's like Hong Kong Wonton\nThey said, \"Oh my, biggest dick I've ever seen\"\nShowed her on the webcam, she start licking the screen\nNext week we party putting coke all up in her nose\nJust me, my nigga Luke and a house full of hoes\n\nAnd it's coke on the corner, guns in the closet\nPills on the table, blowing on exotics\nMoney on the mantle, fuck direct deposit\nOld school Chevy next year we roll exotics\n\nThat Cutty steering wheel all wood like a beaver bed\nYour bitch neck move faster than cheetah legs\nNike 6.0's look like Zebra heads\nWack MC's, I eat 'em like pita bread... rappers\nI voicemail your best bitch\nIn the hood, hoes give me more throat than neck strength\nAll I want is money, cash no checks\nI swear the sight of kushy makes her pussy so wet\nI say my flow cold as the walls in the precinct\nI'm a monster, eat pussy like Wheat Thins\nI'm a rock star without a guitar\nMy chocolate melts in your girl mouth, Mr. Goodbar\nAnd it's weed on the corner, guns on the target\nShorty going crazy, sniffing coke in the closet\nWhile I'm sitting on the toilet puffing on exotics\nBitch busts in the bathroom and fucking vomits"}}, {"title": "Express Yourself", "album": null, "year": "2013-04-04", "lyrics": "Clutch your toes on that wall ho, bounce that ass like a pogo\nShake and roll like a craps game in a Las Vegas casino\nCall all of them freak hoes that bounce that ass to that Diplo\nShe take a dip, then take a sip, then dip dip dip\nAll I wanna do is make her ride this dick\nBouncing on that ass while she biting on her lip\nReally wanna grab it when she look back at it\nWith a look on her face like she just did magic\nJeans on cost about eighteen hundred\nPop a little pill so you know I stay blunted\nBlowing that sticky now it's time to get freaky\nTake a dip in the back, rubber gun in my pinky\nTanga got me rolling, thing she keep on, woah\nNo way that I'm controlling so I gotta put a cheat code\nWe smoking on that potent, drinking on that potion\nShe turnt up, hopped in her hand stand, bounced that ass in slow motion\n\nI said oh no, my God, little mama be twerking hard\nWhen she back that thang, then she clapped that thang, she for sure got my dick hard\n\nAnd I just wanna take ya home and wear you out\nHead for free, no cashing out\nEating on your pussy, got you squirting on your blouse\nHit it from the back on the living room couch\nYou want a thing that your man won't do\nBefore you bust one bitch you gotta bust too\nRun around to got to do what it do cause I just did me so you gotta do you\nDon't stop girl keep twerking it\nLet me see what you working with\nI'm watching you and I'm

party with a big, fat pussy \nAin't no way ya'll fuckin with this, ain't fuckin with this\nMy tongue game good, no ice on my wrists and a big long dick\nSo hit me up when you need the help\nDig your

roll like a craps game in a Las Vegas casino\nCall all of them freak hoes that bounce that ass to that Diplo\nShe take a dip, then take a sip, then dip dip dip\nAll I wanna do is make her ride this dick\nBouncing on that ass while she biting on her lip\nReally wanna grab it when she look back at it\nWith a look on her face like she just did magic\nJeans on cost about eighteen hundred\nPop a little pill so you know I stay blunted\nBlowing that sticky now it's time to get freaky\nTake a dip in the back, rubber gun in my pinky\nTanga got me rolling, thing she keep on, woah\nNo way that I'm controlling so I gotta put a cheat code\nWe smoking on that potent, drinking on that potion\nShe turnt up, hopped in her hand stand, bounced that ass in slow motion\n\nI said oh no, my God, little mama be twerking hard\nWhen she back that thang, then she clapped that thang, she for sure got my dick hard\n\nAnd I just wanna take ya home and wear you out\nHead for free, no cashing out\nEating on your pussy, got you squirting on your blouse\nHit it from the back on the living room couch\nYou want a thing that your man won't do\nBefore you bust one bitch you gotta bust too\nRun around to got to do what it do cause I just did me so you gotta do you\nDon't stop girl keep twerking it\nLet me see what you working with\nI'm watching you and I'm wondering if you can do that with my dick in it\nThe ass looking ridiculous, make me want to get in it\nI swear to God she go ignorant, don\u2019t stop girl, keep getting it\n\nToes on the wall and her ass in the air\nAnd she twerk that thing like she ain't have a care\nWith her toes on the wall and her ass in the air\nAnd she twerk that thing like she ain't have a care\n\nExpress yourself, express yourself\nExpress yourself, express yourself\nExpress yourself, express yourself\nExpress yourself, express yourself\nGo on, girl and express yourself\n\nPop the pussy for a goon nigga\nOld be coming out soon nigga\nSo if you ain't in tune nigga\nRatchet gon' tune up a nigga\nMake like from your hair to your toes\nCan\u2019t hurt your man with something he don\u2019t know\nBetween me and you girl keep it on the low\nEverytime I come around you know it's a freak show\nFour bad hoes in my hotel room\nFucking on the pillows while I sleep til noon\nTripping on the molly and start to go party with a big, fat pussy \nAin't no way ya'll fuckin with this, ain't fuckin with this\nMy tongue game good, no ice on my wrists and a big long dick\nSo hit me up when you need the help\nDig your R's til you ain't gone left\nHad your ass

white bitches like its payback\nYou old niggas playing games like pat sajak\nWhipping up the van away\nBrought an extra ? back\nThe way my bitches licking you would think we at a horse track\nCos' the romanellis long way from Pelle Pelle's\nStacking in the telly with that next tall sally\nBanging R Kelly, getting that ?\nNow what I dick for a show, that first lick they hitting belly\nNow tell me I ain't the crown of the nouns\nUnleash furious verbs, make these peasants bown down\nThe presence of a legend every time i come round\nWhy in my face they smile when I turn my back they frown\n\nHypnotised like staring straight into a serpents eyes\nWant it all in the bags, its like them fries at five guys\nMy eye size is pint sized, blind off the muy thai\n? karate chop, slump leaning sideways\nChicken coop smokey on every other friday\nOne way driving down the wrong way of a highway\nGetting fucked up in public coming down after binging\nNever had class just after school detention\nDid I mention, I'd still be teaching these niggas\nDoing their danny brown rendition, but that shit ain't clicking\nTripping when im hitting off this backwood I'm hitting\nGiggling when I listen to that ? they be kidding\n? The way these niggas rapping's a shame\nIf they wasn't so lame I'd be saying they name\nGet your own shit nigga trying to merge in my lane\nCrash into another car avoiding the thrashing plane\n\nStressed out nigga 'bout to lose my mind\nThe whole damn time I've been thinking about crying\nCause' mind fucked up and I'm fucked up\nSo I get fucked up gone ?\n? Don't waste my time\n? Don't waste my time\nTake this nick hit a lick get a dollar\nCome back and see me been here this whole time\nSmoking on gas thats toxic, say it flew in from the tropic\n? just profit\nNeed that money because i need them boxes\nMind on the green like the ? Celtics\nNine tucked right by the pelvis\nFiends nodding off on the toilet like Elvis\nHave a nigga thinking how the fuck do i sell this\n'Cause i fucking need that money, hit that block couple miles and running\nGotta get them ten, twenties, fifties and hundreds\nHave a nigga locked doing time doing dumb shit\nSo i gotta just think it smarter\nGotta get this money for my daughter\nDog this ain't the eighty nine ? in that cutlass and that shit have you locked before you even get started\n\nI come from a dark past but guess what bitch got a bright future\nThese bitches feeling freaky because my diamonds going Kama Sutra\n'Bout to make a power move, smoking on ?\nUsed to hustle in shower shoes until I got like I had my own shower shoes\nNow these niggas got me on Igor, smell just like the seashore\nShots of my ? serving B more\nI made 200 racks off a D-tour\nOn the interstate with them ? traffic\nStopped my ? but that spot still ? and bouncing\nSo much money I might need counselling\nHad that forty in my Pelle Pelle\nTrapping in that rolling Telly\nI was ? out of town\nStacking up trying to cop a chevy\nSo if you ain't talking about money then you ain't talking about nothing\nGet the fuck out my face because my ? so rambunctious"}}, {"title": "Float On", "album": "Old ", "year": "2013-10-08", "lyrics": "Backwood of that good to the pain for the brain\nA cup of lean for me to sleep, see I be going through thangs\nMusic business got me stressed Xanax to maintain\nWaking up on wrong sides got me writing in vain\nVicodin to numb me up help me cope with the struggle\nRemember praying to get in there saying rap to my brothers\nAnd now I, got the whole world listening\nGive your ear for a second a life changing decision\nEvery other minute thoughts run through my mind\n'bout how bad I wanted this but I cannot waste time\nSo I'm trapped in the beat, stuck on every line\nNothing else matters, except my next rhyme\nYou can never understand all the pressure I'm against\nGetting high thinking how to make it better than your last shit\n\nMight have a mental breakdown\nIf it wasn't for these pills here now\nAnd no matter how it gets I hold on\nRolling up this dope to cope I float on, nigga I float on\n\nLet's go, hop up in the Chevy four-door\nLet's roll (I float on)\n\nRemember back when mommy sent me for the Wonder Bread\nAnd niggas jumped me stomped on my fucking head\nIt's like I learned right then you either sink or you swim\nAnd to beat your enemy, you gotta think like them\nSo I was up late breaking day with the gremlins\nMusic in my heart but my thoughts wouldn't listen\nHood outta bye-bye cause rap shit was sci-fi\nSo I'm tormented with the things I seen with these eyes\nCan't get a wink 'less I'm leaning off of syrup\nDreaming of my past like a nightmare so I wake up\nStaring at the ceiling with this feeling that won't go away\nUntil the verse is done wrote all day but them shit's throwaway\nSo I'm breaking day sniffing Adderall writing\nAnd not for the money for the life after dying\nPray I get old just to hear I been the future\nJust to see my influence in this genre of music\n\nAnd might make it to see somehow\nIf it wasn't for these pills here now\nAnd no matter how it gets I hold on\nRolling up this dope to cope I float on, nigga I float on", "image": "https://images.genius.com/f6aee4654acc61ac2fd098ed1e663aa9.1000x1000x1.jpg", "artist": "Danny Brown", "raw": {"annotation_count": 30, "api_path": "/songs/230313", "description": {"dom": {"tag": "root", "children": [{"tag": "p", "children": ["In Old\u2019s last song, Danny Brown gets very introspective, and recalls to the first part of the album.

be going through thangs\nMusic business got me stressed Xanax to maintain\nWaking up on wrong sides got me writing in vain\nVicodin to numb me up help me cope with the struggle\nRemember praying to get in there saying rap to my brothers\nAnd now I, got the whole world listening\nGive your ear for a second a life changing decision\nEvery other minute thoughts run through my mind\n'bout how bad I wanted this but I cannot waste time\nSo I'm trapped in the beat, stuck on every line\nNothing else matters, except my next rhyme\nYou can never understand all the pressure I'm against\nGetting high thinking how to make it better than your last shit\n\nMight have a mental breakdown\nIf it wasn't for these pills here now\nAnd no matter how it gets I hold on\nRolling up this dope to cope I float on, nigga I float on\n\nLet's go, hop up in the Chevy four-door\nLet's roll (I float on)\n\nRemember back when mommy sent me for the Wonder Bread\nAnd niggas jumped me stomped on my fucking head\nIt's like I learned right then you either sink or you swim\nAnd to beat your enemy, you gotta think like them\nSo I was up late breaking day with the gremlins\nMusic in my heart but my thoughts wouldn't listen\nHood outta bye-bye cause rap shit was sci-fi\nSo I'm tormented with the things I seen with these eyes\nCan't get a wink 'less I'm leaning off of syrup\nDreaming of my past like a nightmare so I wake up\nStaring at the ceiling with this feeling that won't go away\nUntil the verse is done wrote all day but them shit's throwaway\nSo I'm breaking day sniffing Adderall writing\nAnd not for the money for the life after dying\nPray I get old just to hear I been the future\nJust to see my influence in this genre of music\n\nAnd might make it to see somehow\nIf it wasn't for these pills here now\nAnd no matter how it gets I hold on\nRolling up this dope to cope I float on, nigga I float on"}}, {"title": "Freestyle", "album": "Detroit State of Mind 2 ", "year": null, "lyrics": "Hotter than

deserve the finer things\nTold myself back then\nWhen I used to ride a Schwinn\nNow I'm on a tour bus\nGoing places I ain't never been\nWrote my rhymes down on a paper bag\nThat was way back\nHaving dreams of a Cadillac\nDog, I had to bounce back\nLocked a nigga up\nWhy they do me like that?\nNow I'm on the Jack in the county\nAsking mommy for some money\nSwear to God she'd do anything for me\nNow we out the hood and the nightmare is us going back\nSo I won't go to sleep 'til I finish that\nCousin of death anyway\nNow I see better day\nAnd I ain't tryna miss a minute, second hour\nLiving on borrowed time\nCan't think about tomorrow\n'cause it's about today\nAnd you know you wanna take my place\nLet's get it\n\nYou turn around, and now I'm winning\nI built it up, from the ground\nYou stay asleep, I'm gonna get it\nI built it up, from the ground\n\nNow tell me, would you sacrifice your dreams?\nWhat it takes if you want anything\nGot me missing sleep 'cause my mind on the beat\nSo while I'm counting bars y'all be counting sheep\nNo cheat sheet, get it out the mud\nGet it how you live, why I'm out here in the field\nMy nigga wake up, wipe the cold out your eyes\nIt's a cold, cold world but even hotter when you die\nSo no try to do, what about you?\nWork off, well met, do the same thing too\nA lot locked up wishing they was like you\nGot a letter from my nigga saying he be out in June\nBeen down for a minute and every since sentence\nThings ain't been the same so I'm missing my nigga\nStaring at the ceiling thinking how far I came\nWas trapped in the storm but I made it out the rain\n\nYou turn around, and now I'm winning\nI built it up, from the ground\nYou stay asleep, I'm gonna get it\nI built it up, from the ground", "image":

rhymes down on a paper bag\nThat was way back\nHaving dreams of a Cadillac\nDog, I had to bounce back\nLocked a nigga up\nWhy they do me like that?\nNow I'm on the Jack in the county\nAsking mommy for some money\nSwear to God she'd do anything for me\nNow we out the hood and the nightmare is us going back\nSo I won't go to sleep 'til I finish that\nCousin of death anyway\nNow I see better day\nAnd I ain't tryna miss a minute, second hour\nLiving on borrowed time\nCan't think about tomorrow\n'cause it's about today\nAnd you know you wanna take my place\nLet's get it\n\nYou turn around, and now I'm winning\nI built it up, from the ground\nYou stay asleep, I'm gonna get it\nI built it up, from the ground\n\nNow tell me, would you sacrifice your dreams?\nWhat it takes if you want anything\nGot me missing sleep 'cause my mind on the beat\nSo while I'm counting bars y'all be counting sheep\nNo cheat sheet, get it out the mud\nGet it how you live, why I'm out here in the field\nMy nigga wake up, wipe the cold out your eyes\nIt's a cold, cold world but even hotter when you die\nSo no try to do, what about you?\nWork off, well met, do the same thing too\nA lot locked up wishing they was like you\nGot a letter from my nigga saying he be out in June\nBeen down for a minute and every since sentence\nThings ain't been the same so I'm missing my nigga\nStaring at the ceiling thinking how far I came\nWas trapped in the storm but I made it out the rain\n\nYou turn around, and now I'm winning\nI built it up, from the ground\nYou stay asleep, I'm gonna get it\nI built it up, from the ground"}}, {"title": "Fruit Cocktail", "album": "Detroit State of Mind 4", "year": "2010-03-08", "lyrics": "Tryna get high to forget that I'm broke\nThough its high tide still gotta stay afloat\nSweater over hoodie used to be my winter coat\nDish detergent liquid when we ran out of soap\nWalk in to the store plastic bag filled with bottles\nStolen basic cable on our ol' floor model\nCheck in the fridge, nothing to eat\nBaby mama killing roaches with her bare feet\nMy nigga hit me off I fucked up the sack\nTrip to Coney Island fucking with a hood rat\nNow a nigga back, right where I started\nReal true livin' definition of an artist\nSo now a nigga old but ain't shit changed\nHid this morning when the light people came\nNow point me to heaven cause this sure is hell\nTell me whats the difference from being in a cell\n\nMama in the kitchen, scrapin' up a dinner\nDaddy play the lottery, hope he got a winner\nMy brother on the block, tryna catch sales\nSister on the pole, shake her fruit cocktail\nMama in the kitchen, scrapin' up a dinner\nDaddy play the lottery, hope he got a winner\nMy brother on the block, tryna catch sales\nSister on the pole, shake her fruit cocktail\n\nI got locked up, I came back home\nTakin' county chances, just to keep my phone on\nMy baby mama trippin', that bitch don't even work\nStress a nigga out, got me payin' child support\nI'm flirtin' with the Beam, I got a date with death\n38 revolver, got two bullets left\nSometimes I daydream, about puttin' in myself\nRunnin' up to heaven, trippin' up the steps\nMy nigga want a square, only got one left\nSo I'm a bust it down with you\nIf I had it dog, I'd blow a pound with you\nMy nigga understand, that's just how shit goes\nThat's why we get high, cause we feel so low\nAnd tho we livin' fast, the money comin' slow\nGot a lid up on my nigga, cause his time goin slow\nSaid a pray for him quick, fans gotta let him know\n\nMama in the kitchen, scrapin' up a dinner\nDaddy play the lottery, hope he got a winner\nMy brother on the block, tryna catch sales\nSister on the pole, shake her fruit cocktail\nMama in the kitchen, scrapin' up a dinner\nDaddy play

soap\nWalk in to the store plastic bag filled with bottles\nStolen basic cable on our ol' floor model\nCheck in the fridge, nothing to eat\nBaby mama killing roaches with her bare feet\nMy nigga hit me off I fucked up the sack\nTrip to Coney Island fucking with a hood rat\nNow a nigga back, right where I started\nReal true livin' definition of an artist\nSo now a nigga old but ain't shit changed\nHid this morning when the light people came\nNow point me to heaven cause this sure is hell\nTell me whats the difference from being in a cell\n\nMama in the kitchen, scrapin' up a dinner\nDaddy play the lottery, hope he got a winner\nMy brother on the block, tryna catch sales\nSister on the pole, shake her fruit cocktail\nMama in the kitchen, scrapin' up a dinner\nDaddy play the lottery, hope he got a winner\nMy brother on the block, tryna catch sales\nSister on the pole, shake her fruit cocktail\n\nI got locked up, I came back home\nTakin' county chances, just to keep my phone on\nMy baby mama trippin', that bitch don't even work\nStress a nigga out, got me payin' child support\nI'm flirtin' with the Beam, I got a date with death\n38 revolver, got two bullets left\nSometimes I daydream, about puttin' in myself\nRunnin' up to heaven, trippin' up the steps\nMy nigga want a square, only got one left\nSo I'm a bust it down with you\nIf I had it dog, I'd blow a pound with you\nMy nigga understand, that's just how shit goes\nThat's why we get high, cause we feel so low\nAnd tho we livin' fast, the money comin' slow\nGot a lid up on my nigga, cause his time goin slow\nSaid a pray for him quick, fans gotta let him know\n\nMama in the kitchen, scrapin' up a dinner\nDaddy play the lottery, hope he got a winner\nMy brother on the block, tryna catch sales\nSister on the pole, shake her fruit cocktail\nMama in the kitchen, scrapin' up a dinner\nDaddy play the lottery, hope he got a winner\nMy brother on the block, tryna catch sales\nSister on the

minutes, it be on\nStaring at the sidekick, words come to me\nRolling up the Swisher, puffing on the loosie\n\nGot a nigga focused, feeling alright\nWith this type of feeling, I can write all night\nI never had a problem with paying attention\nPopped the Adderall, then I wrote a verse in minutes\nPlay this in your iPod, nodding on Vicodin\nMan, this shit legal, it must be alright then\nNigga, yeah, right, this shit even worse\nWhen doctor wrote prescription, your addiction was birthed\nTurn your kids to fiends with a drug called Ritalin\nThis is for my niggas popping Xannies, not remembering\nUh... what they did last night\nPills and orange tubes got the government right\nThey say there's no stopping from starting Oxycontins\nThey in trailer parks sniffing it with rolled dollars\nAll about a dollar, baby killers in the world\nThe ones that supply you, when you gotta fucking cold\n\nI can't feel, when I'm off this pill\nNo doubt, I done 'em all, Xanny bars, Adderall\nMy mind drifts, let it dissolve in what I sipped\nMy soul blowing in the wind, eat pills and Vicodins\n\nThey say I, might go out like Heath Ledger\nLaughing at the Joker off an antidepressant\nAnd if you can't sleep, they got a pill for that\nBrown good in popping Enzyte to get my dick fat\nFags take hormones to grow a set of titties\nGot a pill to make your dick hard, when you're 60\nNow tell me do that add up, G\nWhen they lock your ass up for a dimebag of weed\nTeen girls take birth control, killing off the seeds\nGot her looking 20, when she only 15\nThey got illegal ones like X and Mescaline\nIn my teens my homie took one, he did 15\nMy granny turned out on them blood pressure pills\nAnd if she don't pop 'em, she might not be here\nBut is it really helping make a nigga shed a tear\nI wonder, do they make a pill to take away your fears?"}}, {"title": "Get Down", "album": "Detroit State of Mind", "year": null, "lyrics": "Detroit state of mind nigga\n(Get-get-get

you to the court\nThey wanna lock you up\nBut your daughter got new Jordans\nYo landlord knocking\nHer girl cock blocking\nDealing with this bullshit\nSmoke up on the constant\nLiving in this world\nAlways on the edge\nSo to clear yo mind\nSmoke one to the head\nPockets on e\nDue on ya lease\nTryna chop you down\nSo roll up the trees\n\nProblem of today\nSmoke it to the face\nIt\u2019s only for a moment\nBut the troubles go away\nProblems of today\nSmoke it to the face\nIt\u2019s only for a moment\nBut the problems go away\n\nSay ya had a bad day\nWant the stress to go away\nJust

on you, even when you cop a squat\nThe nights so long and the days real short\nGame of cat and mouse so I puff a newport\nTo take away the stress, the sess in my chest, gives me the strength to go on\nLife's been short man I'm tryna 'void cort, wanna break me down but I'm too strong\nI got my mind on my money and my money on my mind\nSomething on my wrist the only way I'm doing time\nI eat grilled fish with grino piszo wine\nSitting in a new v with the seats reclines\nSmoke weed everyday just to ease my mind\nTryna live the good life, cos I ain't tryna do time, and I'm\n x2\nWhy's my niggas always yelling out broke shit\nLet's get money cos now you wanna smoke shit\nChill dawg, naa nigga get money\nGet on your grind, ain't a damn thing funny\n\nI won't change for money, money change for me\nNiggas all broke, wanna plot on me\nCos I'm in the hood, no rocks on me\nSmartest nigga they know without a G.E.D\nUsed to hustle all night, going half on hogees\nMe and my nigga going half on Oz's\nNow I ride around in a thing with no lease\nWith rich white niggas, still fuck with parole lease\nOutta Detroit like Alan Houston, I been NY but I ain't no bum\nI'm from where motherfuckers is shooting, I used to cut up and save the crumbs\nSee it ain't where you from, it's where you at\nThe perception of my city, I'm a straight and a fax\nBrowntown motherfucker, yeah I'm taking it back\nAnd do anybody got a fucking problem with that?\n x2\n\nBut the weed in the bag right then get money\nPrims on that new shit, then you get honey\nWhen niggas start hating, then you get funny\nCos when ribs was showing, they didn't feel tummy\nSee, you gotta do what you gotta do\nAnd they gotta do what they gotta do\nSee, you ain't concerned with me, I ain't concerned with you\nYou don't give a fuck, then nigga, fuck you\nI don't need you, you don't need me\nI don't fuck with you, you don't fuck with me\nI help feed niggas who help feed me\nShow love on GP, now I gotta please

chest, gives me the strength to go on\nLife's been short man I'm tryna 'void cort, wanna break me down but I'm too strong\nI got my mind on my money and my money on my mind\nSomething on my wrist the only way I'm doing time\nI eat grilled fish with grino piszo wine\nSitting in a new v with the seats reclines\nSmoke weed everyday just to ease my mind\nTryna live the good life, cos I ain't tryna do time, and I'm\n x2\nWhy's my niggas always yelling out broke shit\nLet's get money cos now you wanna smoke shit\nChill dawg, naa nigga get money\nGet on your grind, ain't a damn thing funny\n\nI won't change for money, money change for me\nNiggas all broke, wanna plot on me\nCos I'm in the hood, no rocks on me\nSmartest nigga they know without a G.E.D\nUsed to hustle all night, going half on hogees\nMe and my nigga going half on Oz's\nNow I ride around in a thing with no lease\nWith rich white niggas, still fuck with parole lease\nOutta Detroit like Alan Houston, I been NY but I ain't no bum\nI'm from where motherfuckers is shooting, I used to cut up and save the crumbs\nSee it ain't where you from, it's where you at\nThe perception of my city, I'm a straight and a fax\nBrowntown motherfucker, yeah I'm taking it back\nAnd do anybody got a fucking problem with that?\n x2\n\nBut the weed in the bag right then get money\nPrims on that new shit, then you get honey\nWhen niggas start hating, then you get funny\nCos when ribs was showing, they didn't feel tummy\nSee, you gotta do what you gotta do\nAnd they gotta do what they gotta do\nSee, you ain't concerned with me, I ain't concerned with you\nYou don't give a fuck, then nigga, fuck you\nI don't need you, you don't need me\nI don't fuck with you, you don't fuck with me\nI help feed niggas who help feed me\nShow love on GP, now I gotta please me\nIf it all end today, I still be pleased\nSmoke weed, drink liquor just to get a release\nThe way shit going it'll never be peace\nTryna keep a piece mind so I keep my piece\n x2"}}, {"title": "Ghetto Life", "album": "Detroit State of Mind", "year": null, "lyrics": "She was only 24 when she first did snow\nTurned out by her boyfriend who used to push coke\nStart

control\nDon\u2019t have a soul\nMyself I don\u2019t know no more\nNumbing up with drugs\nTo suppress these feelings\nPraying to the heavens\nLetting these devils get the best of me\nNigga what\u2019s the recipe for a good time\nA whole lot of liquor while you doing coke lines\nResidue on my mustache\nHow could it last\nRoll a hundred dollar bill\nNigga blow cash\n\nCan\u2019t nobody tell me no\nNigga pass me that blow\nGot to the point ain\u2019t gotta buy drugs\nNiggas just give to em to me\nYea they think they showing love\nAnd that\u2019s what\u2019s up\nKinda fucked up\nNow I do way it more then I use to\nHave no clues\nAll the false alarms\nWhere most would of died\nBut my tolerance strong\nBeen cursed all alone\nWhole family addicts\nFloating through my bloodstream\nLike I gotta have it\nTried to quit a few times\nBut it didn\u2019t work out\nCan you understand\nWhat my life is about\nCause I think you don\u2019t\nSo take a step inside\nA mind so horrific\nImages that I hide\nTake look inside\nScare you for life\nThis is the way\nNigga step inside\n\nMimosa for breakfast\nWith a thick hoe from Texas\nGot good karma\nFeel the persona\nGot the Hermes towel while I'm up in the sauna\nSmoking on ganja\nTasting like caramel\nAss so fat think she get it from hermomma\nCame along way hitting thots in spots\nNow I fuck pornstars I done jerked off and watched\nSpending racks up in \u00a0Bergdorf\nBitches take ya shirt off\nTook a couple molly\u2019s\nNow they wanna have a twerk off\nGuess who the judge\nWhy they hold the grudge\nMe I done got it on my own out the mud\nWill it all last\nWill it all last\nRoll a hundred dollar bill\nNigga blow cash\nWill it all last\nWill it all last\nRoll a hundred dollar bill\nBlowing money fast"}}, {"title": "Greatest Rapper

get his dick sucked\n\nNah, what you think this is\nI ain't paying for your cab bitch you ain't getting shit\nNah, but a mouth full of kids\nTold the bitch take the bus guess what, she did it\nBlew a nigga down like the wolf did the straw house\n'til I huffed and puffed and shot it in her mouth\nNow I got the skinnies sagging with the dirty chucks\nThrift store tee cost a nigga four bucks\nNow hipster bitches bomb a nigga like Pearl Harbor\nSwear to God, I treat a ho like I ain't got a daughter\nMight as well do the same to my baby momma\nWhile all my new hoes look like Jane Fonda\nBump

walk\nNow I'm standing in the shower bumping drum and bass\nStepped out put some Noxzema on my face\nHit a blunt twice and spared up my heart\nNigga my loft looking like a fucking skate park\nBut the only thing I'm griding is the boss nigga\nGoing nuts in the D, coast nigga\nAnd that's a K not a C\nNigga, Brown chief like Kansas City\nAmerican Apparel Jockey Briefs\nStaring in the window thinking \"Ha, I run the city!\"\nRenaissance like a sculpture in my back yard\nSame nigga used to get F's on his report card\n\nAnd I put that on great granddaddy's soul\nTold me I'mma fuck bitches and always have hoes\nSo let me call another bitch up\nA nigga tryna get his dick suck\nMake my toes curl up when you licking my nuts\nSo when I call bitch, you better pick up\nSo let me call another bitch up\nA nigga tryna get his dick sucked\n\nNah, what you think this is\nI ain't paying for your cab bitch you ain't getting shit\nNah, but a mouth full of kids\nTold the bitch take the bus guess what, she did it\nBlew a nigga down like the wolf did the straw house\n'til I huffed and puffed and shot it in her mouth\nNow I got the skinnies sagging with the dirty chucks\nThrift store tee cost a nigga four bucks\nNow hipster bitches bomb a nigga like Pearl Harbor\nSwear to God, I treat a ho like I ain't got a daughter\nMight as well do the same to my baby momma\nWhile all my new hoes look like Jane Fonda\nBump techno and drive little-ass Honda\nGive me brain and they say they learnt from their momma\nSay she bi and make out with her best friend\nLove it to death, but she ain't lesbian"}},

Crunch\nNow we blow big blunts on the way to brunch\nWent from good fella to commissary slips\nNow I got back up man every time I slipped\nNever ever quit, I just kept on pursuing\nTeacher always ask me, what was I doing\nScribbled in my notebook and never did homework\nLow attention span, guess these Adderall worked\nRocked Tommy Hil shirts, ones with the boat\nRockport kicks way before we even smoked\nUsed to have baby lungs, choking when I hit it\nNowadays lace a whole seven in a sitting\nRemember back then we thought we growed up\nRushing as a kid just to be grown up\n\nRushing as a kid just to be grown up\nWhoever thought I'd be the greatest growing up?\n\nI can eat a pound and shit sixty four quarters\nBurn up fire and drown drops of water\nSon, I told you I got them beans like Goya\nGone off them pills, got me jumping off the sofa\nHotter than a Hot Pocket out the devil microwave\nModel bitches begging just be a nigga sex slave\nExotic foreign garments lookin' tailor made\nAnd when these bitches see me man, they wetter than the everglades\nEveryday same shit, me getting paid\nWaking up, new bitch, me getting laid\nUsed to take bottle back, waitress bring the bottle back\nNow they see me shining and they looking like a Sour Patch\nNigga catch a heart attack\nNewport soft pack never blow blunt wraps\nBut these blunt raps sewn up\nWhoever thought I'd be the greatest growing up?\n\nRushing as a kid just to be grown up\nWhoever thought I'd be the greatest growing up?"}}, {"title": "Guitar Solo", "album": "The Hybrid ", "year": "2010-03-16", "lyrics": "My little nigga 14\nGot his hand on the 40 with the infrared beam\nHis daddy locked up and his momma is a fiend\nCatch her tricking on the corner, knees dirty on her jeans\nAt night he never dreams cause he hardly ever sleep\nLaying in the bed, facing someone else's feet\nSo late night he creep, walk around these streets\nWith the same hoodie on, he been wearing for a week\nHe wants something to eat, and his sneaks so scuffed\nJust looking in his eyes, you can tell he living rough\nStanding outside a gas station puffing on a loosie\nDropped outta school cause his peers appeared bougie\nAnd they wear Gucci, and shit that rappers talk\nRobbed an old lady but his ass got caught\nWill he get out, man I really don't know bro\nI hope I'll find out after the guitar solo\n\nThis little girl pregnant man she only 14\nBust in by an older nigga, lack of self-esteem\nHer mom's a gold digger, and her dad is not around\nLast time she saw him he took her to Belle Isle\nA child with a child and her momma don't care\nAnother bridge card gon' put her on welfare\nBaby daddy say he got her, prolly won't succeed\nCause he bought a pair of Cardi's 'stead of reing-up the weed\nHis dream is a cutty with some rims on that bitch\nIs that the type of man you want raising your kids?\nSo now you ditch class cause your belly getting bigger\nAnd every other day your momma fuck another nigga\nSo what she gonna do is find herself a drug dealer\nHer dream and goal in life is to be saved by a nigga\nAnd will she get far?

night he never dreams cause he hardly ever sleep\nLaying in the bed, facing someone else's feet\nSo late night he creep, walk around these streets\nWith the same hoodie on, he been wearing for a week\nHe wants something to eat, and his sneaks so scuffed\nJust looking in his eyes, you can tell he living rough\nStanding outside a gas station puffing on a loosie\nDropped outta school cause his peers appeared bougie\nAnd they wear Gucci, and shit that rappers talk\nRobbed an old lady but his ass got caught\nWill he get out, man I really don't know bro\nI hope I'll find out after the guitar solo\n\nThis little girl pregnant man she only 14\nBust in by an older nigga, lack of self-esteem\nHer mom's a gold digger, and her dad is not around\nLast time she saw him he took her to Belle Isle\nA child with a child and her momma don't care\nAnother bridge card gon' put her on welfare\nBaby daddy say he got her, prolly won't succeed\nCause he bought a pair of Cardi's 'stead of reing-up the weed\nHis dream is a cutty with some rims on that bitch\nIs that the type of man you want raising your kids?\nSo now you ditch class cause your belly getting bigger\nAnd every other day your momma fuck another nigga\nSo what she gonna do is find herself a drug dealer\nHer dream and goal in life is to be saved by a nigga\nAnd will she get far?

I'm gorilla with a silverback\nYou phony like fruit drink concentration\nBrown hard like Coney Island bacon\nBut you don't learn like gas stations\nNow you're ICU patients\nCop the cutty on the weekend\nPussy niggas leaking vaginal secretion\n45 put a hole where you lease in\nHit your baby mama pussy look like sheep skin\n\nIf you ain't getting money what you came for?\nSurgery with the chainsaw\nIf you ain't getting money get the fuck out\nOr get a gun in your mouth\nOr get a gun in your mouth\n\nAnd if I don't see some cash soon\nYou gon' look like Scarface homie in the

homie I be cooking keys\nPot scratched like a hooker's knees\nGetting money from the broth\nHit licks for a living like a preacher with a gospel\nFood stamps in the collection plate\nYeah, Jesus know we on Section 8\nFresher than the first week of school\nAfter Christmas vacation when the year's brand new\nPhone dead got to charge up my battery\nBecause I got more hoes than beauty shops on a Saturday\n\n\nI'm bringing fat niggas back I am so sweet\nGrown as hell throwing rocks at the police\nMe and your big brother got an old beef\nHe walked in on me face-fucking your niece\nHustle hard in a spot for four weeks\nGerman Shepherd in the front yard, no leash\nI got more guns than the hood got mice\nGot more bullets than Japan got rice\nYour costume jewellery shit is not ice\nTell your man quit rapping the nigga's no nice\nI'm out cold like a winter bum\nYour bitch be mad I didn't tell her when I'm finna' cum\nI tell her ass quit acting all reckless\nBitch my nuts a part of a complete breakfast\nYeah you niggas official\nJohnny come to the hood get paid with a pistol\n\nIf you ain't getting money what you came for?\nSurgery with the chainsaw\nIf you ain't getting money get

like Twerk team and I think my dick want to be inside\nRolling balls 'til my dick hard, didn't say heard like a missed call\nI don't really look like I'm tryna fuck\nAnd I probably won't care about her tomorrow\nDamn it ho, what you tryna do \"Pour a deuce lets get chopped and screwed\"\nFool's Gold, and you know, and Balmain mark down the shit\nSmoking on that Frieza, nigga, got a nigga amnesia, nigga\nComatose and I need a dose, wanna get behind that ass you got\nDipping to that Diplo, throw it right when they play tonight\nLooking right, thinking of dimes and I think I am gon' fuck her tonight\nShe lookin' ready to go, and fosho ain't gon stop\nWith her hands on the floor and her feet on the wall\n\nPop the pussy on a hand stand, hand stand\nPop the pussy on a hand stand, hand stand\n(Shake that ass for a gangsta nigga)\nPop the pussy on a hand stand, hand stand\nPop the pussy on a hand stand, hand stand\n(Shake that ass for a hipster nigga)\n\nHands on the floor and her

you're working with, don't stop girl keep twerking it\nI'm watching you and I'm wondering if you could do that with my dick in it\nShe throw it back like a fire ball, hit it up, order like a house call\nWant to eat the cat, beat from the back, then give that ho a mouthful\nHundred dollar pills we rolling, ass in the air she working\nDon't care when we rolling, don't care when we rolling\nHundred dollar pills we rolling, ass in the air she working\nDon't care when we rolling, don't feel when we rolling\nPop the pussy on hand stand, record that on my Handycam\nThat uncut, Ludacris, feel that monkey I go Orangutan\nYou ain't met a nigga like this before, eat it from the back, suck on ya toes\nThe way I put my mouth on it, that pussy was under a mistletoe\nThrow it back to that A-Trak, one hour to that Baauer\nNow she got my dick hard, and I want to fuck her in the shower\nLooking ready to go, oh for sure, I ain't go soft\nGot her hands on floor, and her feet on the

it, don't stop licking til you tell me \"quit it\"\nLet me suck on that clit while you follow my head\nBaby girl, I know you're with it\nBall with me, fall back on that or fantasize\nAnd I love your thighs I can't deny\nWork it like Twerk team and I think my dick want to be inside\nRolling balls 'til my dick hard, didn't say heard like a missed call\nI don't really look like I'm tryna fuck\nAnd I probably won't care about her tomorrow\nDamn it ho, what you tryna do \"Pour a deuce lets get chopped and screwed\"\nFool's Gold, and you know, and Balmain mark down the shit\nSmoking on that Frieza, nigga, got a nigga amnesia, nigga\nComatose and I need a dose, wanna get behind that ass you got\nDipping to that Diplo, throw it right when they play tonight\nLooking right, thinking of dimes and I think I am gon' fuck her tonight\nShe lookin' ready to go, and fosho ain't gon stop\nWith her hands on the floor and her feet on the wall\n\nPop the pussy on a hand stand, hand stand\nPop the pussy on a hand stand, hand stand\n(Shake that ass for a gangsta nigga)\nPop the pussy on a hand stand, hand stand\nPop the pussy on a hand stand, hand stand\n(Shake that ass for a hipster nigga)\n\nHands on the floor and her feet on the wall\nAnd she pop that pussy like she ain't afraid to fall\nWhen her hands on the floor and her feet on the wall\nAnd she pop that pussy like she ain't afraid to fall\n\nLet me see what you're working with, don't stop girl keep twerking it\nI'm watching you and I'm wondering if you could do that with my dick in it\nShe throw it back like a fire ball, hit it up, order like a house call\nWant to eat the cat, beat from the back, then give that ho a mouthful\nHundred dollar pills we rolling, ass in the air she working\nDon't care when we rolling, don't care when we rolling\nHundred dollar pills we rolling, ass in the air she working\nDon't care when we rolling, don't feel when we rolling\nPop the pussy on hand stand, record that on my Handycam\nThat uncut, Ludacris, feel that monkey I go Orangutan\nYou ain't met a nigga like this before, eat it from the back, suck on ya toes\nThe way I put my mouth on it, that pussy was under a mistletoe\nThrow it back to that A-Trak, one hour to that Baauer\nNow she got my dick hard, and I want to fuck her in the shower\nLooking ready to go, oh for sure, I ain't go soft\nGot her hands on floor, and her feet on the wall"}}, {"title": "Head", "album": "Hot Soup", "year": "2008-01-01", "lyrics": "I know you had a long day\nRan a bath with the Calgon and take you away\nYou know I can't cook, so I made a bowl

like dog food\nPulled up in the old school\nBut them clothes is all new\nThem hoes be like who you\nBut them white hoes they already knew\nNow she all up on my thang\nThis Alexander ring\nA couple grams of cocaine\nNow we up in P.F. Chang's\nKeep going back to that bathroom\nI said snort that shit off the bar\nA couple shots of that Cuervo\nNow she suckin my dick in the car\nNow we chewin' on a pill\n'Bout the size of this bitch nipple\nAnd when that wind blow hard\nYou can hear that asshole whistle\nThat's the type of bitch I like\nThat's the kind of ho I love\nA blond hair blue-eyed ho\nWith some dried up blood in her nose\nNow I know nothin' 'bout you\nBut I know a whole lot 'bout me\nAnd one thing's for certain\nI ain't paying for that pussy\nSo if what's in your knees gon' cost me a fee\nCall me cheap and give that head up for free\n\nNow give me head for free\nHead for free, head for free\nCause you ain't gettin' my money\nGive me head for free\nHead for free, head for free\nCause you ain't gettin' my

what\u2019s mine\nBut I be damn if I\u2019m a give up\nStuck up in the hood\nPraying rap would get me out\nMomma \u2018bout to lose her house\nGotta figure this shit out\nUse to catch the bus to 12th\nJust to hustle for some Prada\nIn the kitchen with my uncle\nBeat the pot like a pi\u00f1ata\nBaraka wit the product\nUse to hide it in my closet\nType of shit\nThat have a fiend\nCrawling on his carpet\nWalking over carcasses\nOf artists in my garden\nNice with the bars\nEven the beat begs my pardon\nGot me mistaken\nMuslim salami bacon\nAlways on the defense\nSo it\u2019s no offense taken\nI\u2019m smoking on them raisins\nFrom the bay they taste amazing\nCajun kicking flavor\nAll the time\nNot on occasion\nWould be amazed\nAll the time I heard I wouldn\u2019t make it\nI was writing shit that was so damn amazing\nWhen half these little niggas was still watching\nThat\u2019s so raven\nI was out there hustling\nScraping up and saving\nJust to catch a 12 hour bus to NY\nSleeping on the floor in studios\nAsking God why\nBut never got deterred\nFrom the voice I heard inside\nTell myself everyday\nThe greatest that\u2019s alive\n\nAnd I'm a give em hell for it\nUntil it's heaven on earth\nMy nigga\nI'm a give em hell for it\nFor whatever it\u2019s worth\nMy nigga\nI'm a give em hell for it\nUnless death come first\nMy nigga\nI\u2019m a give em hell for it\nFor whatever it\u2019s worth\nMy nigga\nI'm a give em hell\n\nCause we living in that\nActavis double cups was addicted to that\nHad them demons on my back\nWas escaping through that\nBlamed everybody but myself\nApologies for that\nSo they hold a nigga back\nFor the way that I act\nPeople scared of doing business\nThinking I smoke crack\nI react immature\nTo anyone talking smack\nCause where I'm from respect\nThe only thing that you have\nGrew up virtually poor\nRealities unmasked\nSo my task\nIs inspire your future with my past\nI lived through that shit\nSo you don\u2019t have to go through it\nStepping stones in my life\nHot coals\nWalk with me\nListen when I speak\nEvery time talk with me\nCouple screws loose\nYou don't wanna start\nWith me\nGot it from Motown\nFeel David Ruffin pain\nWanna cry right now \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nSo I\u2019m wishing that it rain\nCause I\u2019m knowing I\u2019m the best\nThey compare skills to sales\nTell myself everyday\nKnow this shit ain\u2019t real\nRadio don\u2019t make you ill\nThey get a hit a they feel they self\nRespect for lyricism\nIn this game ain\u2019t none left\nHave a bitch like Iggy\nThink she sicker than me\nAnd that\u2019s so fucked up\nThat\u2019s just how this shit be\nI just wanna make music\nFuck being a celebrity\nCause these songs that I write\nLeave behind my legacy\n\nAnd I'm a give em hell for it\nUntil it's heaven on earth\nMy nigga\nI'm a give em hell for it\nFor whatever it\u2019s worth\nMy nigga\nI'm a give em hell for it\nUnless death come first\nMy

if I\u2019m a give up\nStuck up in the hood\nPraying rap would get me out\nMomma \u2018bout to lose her house\nGotta figure this shit out\nUse to catch the bus to 12th\nJust to hustle for some Prada\nIn the kitchen with my uncle\nBeat the pot like a pi\u00f1ata\nBaraka wit the product\nUse to hide it in my closet\nType of shit\nThat have a fiend\nCrawling on his carpet\nWalking over carcasses\nOf artists in my garden\nNice with the bars\nEven the beat begs my pardon\nGot me mistaken\nMuslim salami bacon\nAlways on the defense\nSo it\u2019s no offense taken\nI\u2019m smoking on them raisins\nFrom the bay they taste amazing\nCajun kicking flavor\nAll the time\nNot on occasion\nWould be amazed\nAll the time I heard I wouldn\u2019t make it\nI was writing shit that was so damn amazing\nWhen half these little niggas was still watching\nThat\u2019s so raven\nI was out there hustling\nScraping up and saving\nJust to catch a 12 hour bus to NY\nSleeping on the floor in studios\nAsking God why\nBut never got deterred\nFrom the voice I heard inside\nTell myself everyday\nThe greatest that\u2019s alive\n\nAnd I'm a give em hell for it\nUntil it's heaven on earth\nMy nigga\nI'm a give em hell for it\nFor whatever it\u2019s worth\nMy nigga\nI'm a give em hell for it\nUnless death come first\nMy nigga\nI\u2019m a give em hell for it\nFor whatever it\u2019s worth\nMy nigga\nI'm a give em hell\n\nCause we living in that\nActavis double cups was addicted to that\nHad them demons on my back\nWas escaping through that\nBlamed everybody but myself\nApologies for that\nSo they hold a nigga back\nFor the way that I act\nPeople scared of doing business\nThinking I smoke crack\nI react immature\nTo anyone talking smack\nCause where I'm from respect\nThe only thing that you have\nGrew up virtually poor\nRealities unmasked\nSo my task\nIs inspire your future with my past\nI lived through that shit\nSo you don\u2019t have to go through it\nStepping stones in my life\nHot coals\nWalk with me\nListen when I speak\nEvery time talk with me\nCouple screws loose\nYou don't wanna start\nWith me\nGot it from Motown\nFeel David Ruffin pain\nWanna cry right now \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nSo I\u2019m wishing that it rain\nCause I\u2019m knowing I\u2019m the best\nThey compare skills to sales\nTell myself everyday\nKnow this shit ain\u2019t real\nRadio don\u2019t make you ill\nThey get a hit a they feel they self\nRespect for lyricism\nIn this game ain\u2019t none left\nHave a bitch like Iggy\nThink she sicker than me\nAnd that\u2019s so fucked up\nThat\u2019s just how this shit be\nI just wanna make music\nFuck being a celebrity\nCause these songs that I write\nLeave behind my legacy\n\nAnd I'm a give em hell for it\nUntil it's heaven on earth\nMy nigga\nI'm a give em hell for it\nFor whatever it\u2019s worth\nMy nigga\nI'm a give em hell for it\nUnless death come first\nMy nigga\nI'm a give em hell for

fuck if you've got a billion dollars\nYour rhymes are cheap, you release a poor product\nYou a servant in my world, the rap gods curse you\nWhen judgement day's upon you, reality's a virtue\nI walked a thousand miles recitin' a hundred rhymes\nBrought smiles to faces, braced, labels owe me from lines\nI don't give a fuck, a dirty Detroit nigga\nAin't-got-the-bud-but-show-up-with-a-ol-Swisher-ass nigga\nSay \"bitch, I'm still hungry\", they actin' like I made it\nI ain't make it 'til my mama fuckin' sittin' on some acres\nI'm a motherfuckin' threat in the booth, these niggas know\nPoet of the century, decades later they quote it\nDeserve a Nobel Peace Prize for what I recite\nIncite a riot with the speech, I'm Detroit Red on ecstasy\nSores on my scalp cause my last perm burnt me\nHair straight, jumpin' head first in an orgy\nWith a pool of blonde hoes, sniffin' on that white shit\nSo much caucasian pussy, startin' to think that I'm mixed\nBut I be writing that shit, have you rappers pissed\nLike, \"How'd he think of this? I wish I'd thought of that shit\"\nRhymes so real thought I wrote it in Janis Joplin's vomit\nWith the mic GG Allin wiped his ass with\n\nI carry the cross for all my niggas lost but findin the rhyme\nDays of no sunshine like a maze in my mind\nNo enter or exit, Adderall anorexic\nPill-poppin' dyslexic, naughty nature Treach shit\nI think about my next line like you think of the next dime\nI'm the future and the present, same damn time\nAn OG told me \"only nice as your last bar\"\nSo with that said, suck my dick all y'all\nThe Motor City where motor mouths get impounded\nI'm overseas, Australia, lookin' for the blondest\nKsubi jeans, and Ann Demeulermeester\nAnd she like my shoes so I put it in her kiester\nIt's the hybrid like I wrote it in papyrus\nKeep the shit on me, nigga, hood rat baby diaper\nThey heatin' up Caprice like a DC sniper\nRaised off of hot dogs, down the middle slice em'\nI\u2019m hotter than Andre Rison with Left Eye\nRest in peace, baby, but no TLC in my life\nAnd when I reach my fate, and I'm standin' at the gates\nKnow that God'll be proud, sayin' \"Daniel, you was great\"\nBut you other niggas? 'Pac said he want an explanation\nBig turned in his grave, an earthquake in Grenada\nWhen Pun shed a tear it hurricane for a week\nWhen Big L get upset and start tornadoin' trees"}}, {"title": "I'm

{"title": "Interview at Pitchfork Festival", "album": null, "year": null, "lyrics": "826 CHICAGO: If you had to come up with a Ben & Jerry\u2019s flavor, what would you put in it?\nDANNY BROWN: What would I put in my Ben & Jerry\u2019s flavor? Damn that\u2019s kinda tight? I guess it would be vanilla and kiwi.\n826 CHICAGO: Why kiwi?\nBROWN: I don\u2019t know, I just like kiwi, and it\u2019s like, I don\u2019t find it that much, you know? I have a Filipina grandma and she liked kiwi a lot so I got it from her.\n826 CHICAGO: What would you name the flavor then?\nBROWN: I guess I would put a little caramel in there too, though, because I like caramel\u2026 but I don\u2019t know, that\u2019s a good question. I guess it would be \u201cThe Hybrid.\u201d\n826 CHICAGO: If you could make a collaboration song with any rapper living or dead, who would it be?\nBROWN: I guess I would pick a dead one since that would be cooler. Mac Dre from Oakland, I like him a lot.\n826 CHICAGO: I read that you grew up in Detroit, what do you think about Detroit? Does it influence your music?\nBROWN: The fact was there was nothing to do in Detroit, so I had no choice but to stay inside. It was better to just stay out of trouble and stay inside and make music. It was something to do for fun, it was a hobby and now I get paid to do my hobby. That\u2019s the American dream, right?\n826 CHICAGO: Who was your favorite artist when you were first making music?\nBROWN: First it was Nas. I always wanted to rap like Nas. As I got older, it changed as it started being about songwriting.\n826 CHICAGO: What do you demand backstage before a show?\nBROWN: I like sparkling water, like Perrier. I like to keep a lot of fruit because I don\u2019t eat that much fruit like I\u2019m supposed to, so I figure if I have fruit backstage and I get hungry and there\u2019s nothing else to eat, it\u2019s good to force myself to be healthy. Celery, almonds, and stuff that\u2019ll kill you, like cigarettes and liquor, but we\u2019ll keep that out. But for the most part fruit, celery, almonds, Perrier.\n826 CHICAGO: If you could travel back in time to meet your 18-year-old self, what would you tell him?\nBROWN: Don\u2019t listen to nobody but yourself because that\u2019s who ends up being up right at the end of the day. Everyone could tell me what I couldn\u2019t do but no one could told me what I could do except myself. So once I started believing in myself that\u2019s when stuff started happening, so I would just tell myself don\u2019t listen to nobody man, just listen to yourself.\n826 CHICAGO: Who do you make music for, yourself or your fans?\nBROWN: Myself at first, but then I started making money off it, so at the end of the day then I guess it\u2019s a little bit of both, you know? I make music for myself but I make it for people to enjoy it because if it was just for me, it would be some depressing-type stuff.\n826 CHICAGO: Do you have any crazy fan stories?\nBROWN: I guess not too much, because I don\u2019t party or hang out that much. I usually go and do shows and go back to my hotel room and play videogames. So I guess the craziest stories are people just stalking outside my hotel room. I might go out to smoke a cigarette and have people bum rushing me for pictures but that pretty much it. But that\u2019s cool, it comes with the territory.\n826 CHICAGO: Do you like playing inside or outside better?\nBROWN: Inside. Because if it rains then what? I\u2019ve played in the rain a lot and I don\u2019t like playing in the rain, so I\u2019d rather play indoors.\n826 CHICAGO: Your songs often have a narrative, how much of that is autobiographical?\nBROWN: I\u2019d say 75%. Sometimes I exaggerate stuff for entertainment purposes because I like to make people laugh, but for the most part 75%.\n826 CHICAGO: Do you like writing or performing better?\nBROWN: Writing because it\u2019s the beginning stages. I\u2019ll write a song and I\u2019ll sing it to myself for a year and think they\u2019ll go crazy for this! Then two years later, I\u2019ll perform it for the crowd and they go crazy and I think, I was right! It\u2019s like a fulfilling feeling, a weird feeling but it\u2019s tight.\n826 CHICAGO: Do you have a favorite venue?\nBROWN: I like playing in London, I love it out there, the fans are more there for the music. In America a lot of the time you\u2019ll do stuff because its cool. You\u2019ll come because your friends are there, maybe some girl\u2019s there, but overseas in London, they only go for the music and I like that\n826 CHICAGO: If you were deserted on an island, what three things would you want?\nBROWN: Water, Wi-Fi, and a laptop, and I\u2019m gonna get an Uber to come pick me up! Uber a boat to me, you know?\n826 CHICAGO: What\u2019s the coolest thing you\u2019ve ever seen at a live show?\nBROWN: I\u2019ve been to a lot of live shows man. I guess the coolest thing would be the chance to open up for Eminem and being around Eminem. I grew up in Detroit, so I looked up to him a lot. Being able to see him was a big deal to me.", "image": "https://images.genius.com/a90232661a504a9c5c4f0ecdf2aed6f3.300x400x1.jpg", "artist": "Danny Brown", "raw": {"annotation_count": 4, "api_path": "/songs/491774", "description": {"dom": {"tag": "root", "children": [{"tag": "p", "children": ["Interview conducted by the ", {"tag": "a", "attributes": {"href": "http://www.826chi.org/", "rel": "nofollow"}, "children": ["826CHI nonprofit youth creative writing center"]}, " with Danny Brown at the ", {"tag": "em", "children": ["Pitchfork Festival"]}, ".

Damn that\u2019s kinda tight? I guess it would be vanilla and kiwi.\n826 CHICAGO: Why kiwi?\nBROWN: I don\u2019t know, I just like kiwi, and it\u2019s like, I don\u2019t find it that much, you know? I have a Filipina grandma and she liked kiwi a lot so I got it from her.\n826 CHICAGO: What would you name the flavor then?\nBROWN: I guess I would put a little caramel in there too, though, because I like caramel\u2026 but I don\u2019t know, that\u2019s a good question. I guess it would be \u201cThe Hybrid.\u201d\n826 CHICAGO: If you could make a collaboration song with any rapper living or dead, who would it be?\nBROWN: I guess I would pick a dead one since that would be cooler. Mac Dre from Oakland, I like him a lot.\n826 CHICAGO: I read that you grew up in Detroit, what do you think about Detroit? Does it influence your music?\nBROWN: The fact was there was nothing to do in Detroit, so I had no choice but to stay inside. It was better to just stay out of trouble and stay inside and make music. It was something to do for fun, it was a hobby and now I get paid to do my hobby. That\u2019s the American dream, right?\n826 CHICAGO: Who was your favorite artist when you were first making music?\nBROWN: First it was Nas. I always wanted to rap like Nas. As I got older, it changed as it started being about songwriting.\n826 CHICAGO: What do you demand backstage before a show?\nBROWN: I like sparkling water, like Perrier. I like to keep a lot of fruit because I don\u2019t eat that much fruit like I\u2019m supposed to, so I figure if I have fruit backstage and I get hungry and there\u2019s nothing else to eat, it\u2019s good to force myself to be healthy. Celery, almonds, and stuff that\u2019ll kill you, like cigarettes and liquor, but we\u2019ll keep that out. But for the most part fruit, celery, almonds, Perrier.\n826 CHICAGO: If you could travel back in time to meet your 18-year-old self, what would you tell him?\nBROWN: Don\u2019t listen to nobody but yourself because that\u2019s who ends up being up right at the end of the day. Everyone could tell me what I couldn\u2019t do but no one could told me what I could do except myself. So once I started believing in myself that\u2019s when stuff started happening, so I would just tell myself don\u2019t listen to nobody man, just listen to yourself.\n826 CHICAGO: Who do you make music for, yourself or your fans?\nBROWN: Myself at first, but then I started making money off it, so at the end of the day then I guess it\u2019s a little bit of both, you know? I make music for myself but I make it for people to enjoy it because if it was just for me, it would be some depressing-type stuff.\n826 CHICAGO: Do you have any crazy fan stories?\nBROWN: I guess not too much, because I don\u2019t party or hang out that much. I usually go and do shows and go back to my hotel room and play videogames. So I guess the craziest stories are people just stalking outside my hotel room. I might go out to smoke a cigarette and have people bum rushing me for pictures but that pretty much it. But that\u2019s cool, it comes with the territory.\n826 CHICAGO: Do you like playing inside or outside better?\nBROWN: Inside. Because if it rains then what? I\u2019ve played in the rain a lot and I don\u2019t like playing in the rain, so I\u2019d rather play indoors.\n826 CHICAGO: Your songs often have a narrative, how much of that is autobiographical?\nBROWN: I\u2019d say 75%. Sometimes I exaggerate stuff for entertainment purposes because I like to make people laugh, but for the most part 75%.\n826 CHICAGO: Do you like writing or performing better?\nBROWN: Writing because it\u2019s the beginning stages. I\u2019ll write a song and I\u2019ll sing it to myself for a year and think they\u2019ll go crazy for this! Then two years later, I\u2019ll perform it for the crowd and they go crazy and I think, I was right! It\u2019s like a fulfilling feeling, a weird feeling but it\u2019s tight.\n826 CHICAGO: Do you have a favorite venue?\nBROWN: I like playing in London, I love it out there, the fans are more there for the music. In America a lot of the time you\u2019ll do stuff because its cool. You\u2019ll come because your friends are there, maybe some girl\u2019s there, but overseas in London, they only go for the music and I like that\n826 CHICAGO: If you were deserted on an island, what three things would you want?\nBROWN: Water, Wi-Fi, and a laptop, and I\u2019m gonna get an Uber to come pick me up! Uber a boat to me, you know?\n826 CHICAGO: What\u2019s the coolest thing you\u2019ve ever seen at a live show?\nBROWN: I\u2019ve been to a lot of live shows man. I guess the coolest thing would be the chance to open up for Eminem and being around Eminem. I grew up in Detroit, so I looked up to him a lot.

yellow, it tastes like jello\nNo medicare but the flow's so sick\nCause Brown got grain like a hot pot of grits\nYour girl gave me head and cooked a bullshit breakfast\nAnd that pussy bow like that weave down in Texas\nI play the game no coaches\nBrown done been through more raids than roaches\nMy bitch eat pills like M&M's\nGive me head, say it taste like cinnamon\n\nI can sell heat to a camel, ice to a penguin\nBread to a bird, nigga you ain't heard?\nFrom the first to the third, I'mma get my money\nRain, hail, snow, double up when it's sunny\nSee us with a ho, no we straight bust, owed her\nSay we gon' pay her when we finish, and we older\nEarn his own jeans with the AirMax laced up\nSing so high you can tell that I'm caked up\nI open doors like Benson\nNigga I'm the truth like Jesus' opinion\nRain on the moonroof, smud shotgun\nTellin' me a story 'bout her ex caught a hot one\nIt's all good\nPut my dick through her mouth like screw through her wood\nPopped three pills then

welfare, nursing on focused hope\nPops left, young age, mom got her shoulder rope\nMom can't do that, mom's drunk off dope\nCold water bath, tic tac sized soaps\nSis' got pregnant, when she was young\nOut here trickin' making you watch her son\nStolen cable BET stay on the screen\nNever a dull moment, mom fight with other fiends\nThe happiest moment when you sleep and you dream\nThen you wake up to the same old thing\nCereal no milk, dishes in the sink\nOlder brother runnin' 'round, gettin' money, wearing mink\nWon't buy nothin' to eat, always buy drinks\nGet the whole house drunk, then shit pop off\nMomma boyfriend trippin' 'bout a dime got lost\nMind is lost, smoke a blunt, try to do (law?)\nSeem fit to sell drugs, but you just too soft\nHard times at school because your peer is off\nToo many roaches, might see a mouse\nExtension cords get power from the neighbor's house\nGot two pair of jeans, dead air, one's\nBrother old coke square smoke in your lungs\nThe man of the house but your momma youngest son\nBack to the wall, face to the wind\nMa's scratch the last of the number but don't win\nSister disappearing always leaving her kids\nTired of ramen noodles, you can see your ribs\nLot of sugar in the Kool-Aid keep your thirst quenched\nCigarettes and weed, make your eyes squint\nFridge empty, nothin' in the cabinet but spinach\nAnd you ain't Popeye, livin' in a crowded house\nSpace heater keeps you warm, while you sleep on the couch\nBridge card every first, keep food in your mouth\nUnless your mom sell 'em for drugs, and then you know\nThat month, shit gon' be fucked up\nSo you go to school, for the free lunch and stuff\nBut niggas teasing like you some type of punk and stuff\nSo you got kicked out for punching and stuff\nHeadaches at night, and your stomach is growling\nCrack smoke in the air and the wolves is howling\n...eviction notice on the door\n...niggas sleepin' on the floor\n...you can't take it no more\nJust listen you can make it out\nJust look at what's around you take a different route\nIf you don't have a dream, how could it come true?\nTake a look at me, look what I've been through\nIt's a discription...", "image":

pregnant, when she was young\nOut here trickin' making you watch her son\nStolen cable BET stay on the screen\nNever a dull moment, mom fight with other fiends\nThe happiest moment when you sleep and you dream\nThen you wake up to the same old thing\nCereal no milk, dishes in the sink\nOlder brother runnin' 'round, gettin' money, wearing mink\nWon't buy nothin' to eat, always buy drinks\nGet the whole house drunk, then shit pop off\nMomma boyfriend trippin' 'bout a dime got lost\nMind is lost, smoke a blunt, try to do (law?)\nSeem fit to sell drugs, but you just too soft\nHard times at school because your peer is off\nToo many roaches, might see a mouse\nExtension cords get power from the neighbor's house\nGot two pair of jeans, dead air, one's\nBrother old coke square smoke in your lungs\nThe man of the house but your momma youngest son\nBack to the wall, face to the wind\nMa's scratch the last of the number but don't win\nSister disappearing always leaving her kids\nTired of ramen noodles, you can see your ribs\nLot of sugar in the Kool-Aid keep your thirst quenched\nCigarettes and weed, make your eyes squint\nFridge empty, nothin' in the cabinet but spinach\nAnd you ain't Popeye, livin' in a crowded house\nSpace heater keeps you warm, while you sleep on the couch\nBridge card every first, keep food in your mouth\nUnless your mom sell 'em for drugs, and then you know\nThat month, shit gon' be fucked up\nSo you go to school, for the free lunch and stuff\nBut niggas teasing like you some type of punk and stuff\nSo you got kicked out for punching and stuff\nHeadaches at night, and your stomach is growling\nCrack smoke in the air and the wolves is howling\n...eviction notice on the door\n...niggas sleepin' on the floor\n...you can't take it no more\nJust listen you can make it out\nJust look at what's around you take a different route\nIf you don't have a dream, how could it come true?\nTake a look at me, look what I've been through\nIt's a discription..."}}, {"title": "I Will", "album": "XXX", "year": "2011-08-15", "lyrics": "Put a cup up, put a four up in it\nSixes on that Chevy with some hoes in it\nPut a cup up, put a four up in

her health care\nCause nobody else care, cause 2Pac ain't there\nDropped outta high school, tried to go to night school\nGot a G.E.D. to take care of that (Baby)\nNow she smoke blunts on the block and\nHer feet ain't never washed, tryna get someone to watch her (Baby)\nHave a baby in your teens, grown nobody want ya\nCause ain't nobody tryna be a damn step father\nBitch, you a bother, ho, is

they coming at me sort of like a meteor shower\nMy forehead's sweaty, my eyelids heavy, feeling like I ain't going make it\nCause inside my head's like a firework show in the 4th July in Las Vegas\nSaid, I'm tripping, I'm slipping, feeling like I just can't move\nI done took me a couple more pills\nNext thing I know, I'm taking off my shoes\nAnd I'm on walking on these clouds like marshmallows\nNodding off, smelling like rose petals\nZoning out, two-three, like the fiend in hell fire and angel wings\nI'm conscious to that world, connin science 'bout that world\nAll these drugs up in me, it's a miracle I ain't mirror Kurt\nI'm numb like a mortician, going dumb with Oakland bitches\nThey say you hella boosie, roll a backwood up with them cookies\n\nI'm smoking, back to back, back to back, back to back\nIt's the blunt after blunt rotation\nNow I'm in a kush coma off the OG aroma\nAnd my brain going on vacation\nI'm smoking, back to back, back to back, back to back\nIt's the blunt after blunt rotation\nNow I'm in a kush coma off the OG aroma\nAnd my brain going on vacation\n\nKush coma, I am in a kush coma\nKush coma, I am in a kush coma\nKush coma, I am in a kush

kush\nGet fly, my niggas, dope looks\nSo many numbers in my phone book\nI could start a mothafuckin' phone book\nKnow all the fly bitches gonna look\nLike I'm on something, tell 'em roll something\nI'm that one nigga, bumping 2Pac\nBe like three hoes, that's a foursome\nFuck niggas always want to hold something\nYoung hot nigga done froze on 'em\nWent cold on 'em, beat the golds on 'em\nAnd clothes on 'em, see the hoes on 'em?\nOnly fear God, never sold on Him\nMan, I swear to God, put my soul on Him\nLife's a bitch, but she chose on him\nShould've died in Hell, but I rose on 'em\nIn big shades, fuck the hypocrites, stop\nTime let the tats, for the tick, tock\nClocks on the wall, fuck your wristwatch\nPause, let it stop, hope we get by\nBye when I zoom, let it vroom\n'bout a hundred goons with a fume, better let it fuse\nA hundred miles an hour on the booth, better let it loose\nA hundred by the sour, molly, flower, and they love the shrooms\nThat's real rap, I'm stating facts\nContradictions, can't take it back\nMommy's stripping, make it clap\nIn a kush coma, finna take a nap (I'm out)\n\nKush coma, I am in a kush coma\nKush coma, I am in a kush coma\nKush

with that cotton mouth, weed grow house on plantation\nNuggets the size of Rakim rings, got my head looking like a fatality screen\nGot my mind dripping, gotta get away from all this bullshit in my way\nKnowing goddamn well when the high go away\nSame shit gon' be still in my way\nI'm a slave to the sticky icky, so nigga roll something with me\nBeen smoking blunts since high school\nNow look at all the bullshit I been through\nWanna pass out, but we stayin up, nigga gotta keep one eye open\nCause nigga ain't tryna miss the next turn\nNigga roll up, then we starting smoking\nI'm smoking on that ocho, got my mind on that cosmos\nSipping on that purple, got a nigga in slo-mo\nDipping in that molly, feel like I'm doing 100 on a Harley\nTell your baby momma sorry, that was one night and please don't call me\n\nI'm smoking, back to back, back to back, back to back\nIt's the blunt after blunt rotation\nNow I'm in a kush coma off the OG aroma\nAnd my brain going on vacation\nI'm

hour\nAnd all I see is stars and they coming at me sort of like a meteor shower\nMy forehead's sweaty, my eyelids heavy, feeling like I ain't going make it\nCause inside my head's like a firework show in the 4th July in Las Vegas\nSaid, I'm tripping, I'm slipping, feeling like I just can't move\nI done took me a couple more pills\nNext thing I know, I'm taking off my shoes\nAnd I'm on walking on these clouds like marshmallows\nNodding off, smelling like rose petals\nZoning out, two-three, like the fiend in hell fire and angel wings\nI'm conscious to that world, connin science 'bout that world\nAll these drugs up in me, it's a miracle I ain't mirror Kurt\nI'm numb like a mortician, going dumb with Oakland bitches\nThey say you hella boosie, roll a backwood up with them cookies\n\nI'm smoking, back to back, back to back, back to back\nIt's the blunt after blunt rotation\nNow I'm in a kush coma off the OG aroma\nAnd my brain going on vacation\nI'm smoking, back to back, back to back, back to back\nIt's the blunt after blunt rotation\nNow I'm in a kush coma off the OG aroma\nAnd my brain going on vacation\n\nKush coma, I am in a kush coma\nKush coma, I am in a kush coma\nKush coma, I am in a kush coma\nKush coma, I am in a kush coma\nKush coma, I am in a kush coma\nKush coma, I am in a kush coma\nKush coma, I am in a kush coma\nKush coma, I am in a kush coma\n\nGet high, my niggas, smoke kush\nGet fly, my niggas, dope looks\nSo many numbers in my phone book\nI could start a mothafuckin' phone book\nKnow all the fly bitches gonna look\nLike I'm on something, tell 'em roll something\nI'm that one nigga, bumping 2Pac\nBe like three hoes, that's a foursome\nFuck niggas always want to hold something\nYoung hot nigga done froze on 'em\nWent cold on 'em, beat the golds on 'em\nAnd clothes on 'em, see the hoes on 'em?\nOnly fear God, never sold on Him\nMan, I swear to God, put my soul on Him\nLife's a bitch, but she chose on him\nShould've died in Hell, but I rose on 'em\nIn big shades, fuck the hypocrites, stop\nTime let the tats, for the tick, tock\nClocks on the wall, fuck your wristwatch\nPause, let it stop, hope we get by\nBye when I zoom, let it vroom\n'bout a hundred goons with a fume, better let it fuse\nA hundred miles an hour on the booth, better let it loose\nA hundred by the sour, molly, flower, and they love the shrooms\nThat's real rap, I'm stating facts\nContradictions, can't take it back\nMommy's stripping, make it clap\nIn a kush coma, finna take a nap (I'm out)\n\nKush coma, I am in a kush coma\nKush coma, I am in a kush coma\nKush coma, I am in a kush coma\nKush coma, I am in a kush coma\nKush coma, I am in a kush coma\nKush coma, I am in a kush coma\nKush coma, I am in a kush coma\nKush coma, I am in a kush coma\n\nHalf asleep with that cotton mouth, weed grow house on plantation\nNuggets the size of Rakim rings, got my head looking like a fatality screen\nGot my mind dripping, gotta get away from all this bullshit in my way\nKnowing goddamn well when the high go away\nSame shit gon' be still in my way\nI'm a slave to the sticky icky, so nigga roll something with me\nBeen smoking blunts since high school\nNow look at all the bullshit I been through\nWanna pass out, but we stayin up, nigga gotta keep one eye open\nCause nigga ain't tryna miss the next turn\nNigga roll up, then we starting smoking\nI'm smoking on that ocho, got my mind on that cosmos\nSipping on that purple, got a nigga in slo-mo\nDipping in that molly, feel like I'm doing 100 on a Harley\nTell your baby momma sorry, that was one night and please don't call me\n\nI'm smoking, back to back, back to back, back to back\nIt's the blunt after blunt rotation\nNow I'm in a kush coma off the OG aroma\nAnd my brain going on vacation\nI'm smoking, back to back, back to back, back to back\nIt's the blunt after blunt rotation\nNow I'm in a kush coma off the OG aroma\nAnd my brain going on vacation\n\nKush coma, I am in a kush coma\nKush coma, I am in a kush coma\nKush coma, I am in a kush coma\nKush coma, I am in a kush coma\nKush coma, I am in a kush coma\nKush coma, I am in a kush coma\nKush coma, I am in a kush coma\nKush coma, I

I don't know my nigga\nLet's blow, hey yo you got another swisher?\nLight the gan up, c'mon roll with a nigga...\n\nJust another day in the streets of the D\nGas on high and my tank on E\nThese hoes wanna fuck but they charge you a fee\nAnd the work might cost but to murder is free\nPray and holler at my man 'cuz he owe me a few\nGan in the air, with a Bud Ice brew\nNarco's ride, so I took my sack\nAnd before hop on the lines 'cuz I know its packed\nBreak bows, so I ride slow, slow\nHit the Coney's cause my gas low, low\nCop a bag, roll a blunt and say to extras\nAnd I swoop a couple hoes then ride up Dexter\nBlow my trees, no stress at all\nGan in mine but it's stress in y'all\nHit the crib get dressed as soon as the sun fall\nRight now I'm just rhyming, timing my phone calls",

take, for the chrome 28's\nMomma said son, keep your head up\nBut it's hard in the D I gotta get my bread up\nSo I ride '94 with nowhere to go\nBag came in, cause I moved the bows\nThe son of a player no love for hoes\nAnd the year ain't new, but it don't look old\nShould hit Northland see what they got new\nBut I'd rather hit the store go fuck with the crew\nRide around the hood blow blunt after blunt\nSeem like a good day I ain't seen a hook once\nSo I'm riding in the wood 'bout to pick my man up\nHit a couple corners probably roll some gan up\nMy man's got his heater 'cuz the streets is cold\nBut I told him put it up because my L's is bold\n\nLet's go... c'mon, roll with a nigga\nWhere we going? I don't know my nigga\nLet's blow, hey yo you got another swisher?\nLight the gan up, c'mon roll with a nigga...\n\nJust another day in the streets of the D\nGas on high and my tank on E\nThese hoes wanna fuck but they charge you a fee\nAnd the work might cost but to murder is free\nPray and holler at my man 'cuz he owe me a few\nGan in the air, with a Bud Ice brew\nNarco's ride, so I took my sack\nAnd before hop on the lines 'cuz I know its packed\nBreak bows, so I ride slow, slow\nHit the Coney's cause my gas low, low\nCop a bag, roll a blunt and say to extras\nAnd I swoop a couple hoes then ride up Dexter\nBlow my trees, no stress at all\nGan in mine but it's stress in y'all\nHit the crib get dressed as soon as the sun fall\nRight now I'm just rhyming, timing my phone calls"}},

tell you how the streets feel\nEverybody thirsty and they looking for a refill\nIf the gang eating, guns barking at your doggie bag\nGet took out for your take out now you carry out\nMurder by delivery, married at the paramount\nI just coughed up a fair amount of niggas might air it out\nJudge a book by cover so we never educated\nIt ain't about races, poor and rich segregated\nJust to get the bacon dawg, you gotta go HAM\nUse to be lost 'til I found who I am\nBut it took the hook to eat the palm on my hands\nLocked tryna get real creative with the spam\nLocked in a jam cause a nigga serve butter\nJust to get a little bread had to keep the mayo smothered\nAll I really wanted was to overdub my vocals\nBut no one ever thought that I would take it past local\nHigh a'top a totem man somebody shoulda told 'em\nThat if money grow on trees being rich is dime a dozen\n\nSo I'm smoking by my lonely\nBy my goddamn self, I don't need your help, homie\nCause don't nobody really know me\nSaid nobody really know me\n\nSee that's going on a limb\nAnd I used to sell trees, and I used to rock Timbs\nRadiohead shit, fiends with the Bends\nBack when Granny used to tell me \"Stay Out of In\"\nLetting the cold air out, tryna know my whereabouts\nGone for three days and nobody ever heard about\nHow I got these Jordans, but that ain't too important\nWhen I got a bitch pregnant and I'm stacking for abortion\nAnd all I really wanted was to give myself a portion\nLit up off the Henny got a nigga self absorbing\nSmoking on a bogie, no bud style, who can I trust now?\nLady snitch and got the whole block down\nNow we gon' eat now, no rebound\nWhen your boxed out, belly of the beast now\nNow you got me feeling trapped and I can't look back\nWhen the road ahead is gold and the past is made of ash\nAnd I'm going through the trash tryna find a little treasure\nLiving for the better tryna get myself together\n\nSo I'm smoking by my lonely\nBy my goddamn self, I don't need your help, homie\nCause don't nobody really know me\nSaid nobody really know me", "image": "https://images.genius.com/f6aee4654acc61ac2fd098ed1e663aa9.1000x1000x1.jpg", "artist": "Danny Brown", "raw":

nous\nS'\u00e9l\u00e8vera\n\nHipster by heart but I can tell you how the streets feel\nEverybody thirsty and they looking for a refill\nIf the gang eating, guns barking at your doggie bag\nGet took out for your take out now you carry out\nMurder by delivery, married at the paramount\nI just coughed up a fair amount of niggas might air it out\nJudge a book by cover so we never educated\nIt ain't about races, poor and rich segregated\nJust to get the bacon dawg, you gotta go HAM\nUse to be lost 'til I found who I am\nBut it took the hook to eat the palm on my hands\nLocked tryna get real creative with the spam\nLocked in a jam cause a nigga serve butter\nJust to get a little bread had to keep the mayo smothered\nAll I really wanted was to overdub my vocals\nBut no one ever thought that I would take it past local\nHigh a'top a totem man somebody shoulda told 'em\nThat if money grow on trees being rich is dime a dozen\n\nSo I'm smoking by my lonely\nBy my goddamn self, I don't need your help, homie\nCause don't nobody really know me\nSaid nobody really know me\n\nSee that's going on a limb\nAnd I used to sell trees, and I used to rock Timbs\nRadiohead shit, fiends with the Bends\nBack when Granny used to tell me \"Stay Out of In\"\nLetting the cold air out, tryna know my whereabouts\nGone for three days and nobody ever heard about\nHow I got these Jordans, but that ain't too important\nWhen I got a bitch pregnant and I'm stacking for abortion\nAnd all I really wanted was to give myself a portion\nLit up off the Henny got a nigga self absorbing\nSmoking on a bogie, no bud style, who can I trust now?\nLady snitch and got the whole block down\nNow we gon' eat now, no rebound\nWhen your boxed out, belly of the beast now\nNow you got me feeling trapped and I can't look back\nWhen the road ahead is gold and the past is made of ash\nAnd I'm going through the trash tryna find a little treasure\nLiving for the better tryna get myself together\n\nSo I'm smoking by my lonely\nBy my goddamn self, I don't need your help, homie\nCause don't nobody really know me\nSaid nobody really know me"}}, {"title": "Lost", "album": "Atrocity Exhibition", "year":

curl bag\nWhile she draw me a bath\nRoll a blunt then passed\nJiggled and giggled her booty\nCouldn\u2019t do nothing but laugh\nCredit cards separating\nWhite lines on a mirror\nRoll a 100 dollar bill\nNow my sinus all clearer\nFlat screen porn on\nWatching Asa Akira\nNothing on but my pinky ring\nSniff when I get up\nOn the balcony drunk\nLike the world is mine\nStaggering inside with my robe untied\n\nSo fuck waiting round\nNigga I\u2019m about to get it\nDog I\u2019m tryna eat\nSo I\u2019m staying in the kitchen\nHunched over the stove\nGotta water water whip it\nLost in the sauce but a nigga still stirring\nPacking up them bags but a nigga ain't tripping\nLost in the sauce but a nigga still dipping\nLost on the sauce but a nigga ain\u2019t flipping\nCutting up the hard like the yard

wrinkle pussy\nHoe can\u2019t be ya lover\nBut I still get the head\nIf you swallow with bubbles\nI'm a Linwood nigga I done traveled the world\nMade a name for myself use to serve on the curb\nNow my words worth a bird\nI could front you a zip\nMade a million in a year and I still ain\u2019t trip\nBout to put my niggas on make a million for them\nShow you that you can make it without acting like them\nDo you lil nigga go out there and just get it\nGotta have a hardback\nBecause these niggas gon\u2019 whip it\nDo you lil nigga get up out there get it\nGotta have a hardback\nBecause these

streets\nIn the Caddy Ron Isley on between in the sheets\nAnd a way a nigga work make a grip in a week\nI\u2019m a chill with this freak\nSniff a gram and a half\nPlus her pussy juicier than Shalamar curl bag\nWhile she draw me a bath\nRoll a blunt then passed\nJiggled and giggled her booty\nCouldn\u2019t do nothing but laugh\nCredit cards separating\nWhite lines on a mirror\nRoll a 100 dollar bill\nNow my sinus all clearer\nFlat screen porn on\nWatching Asa Akira\nNothing on but my pinky ring\nSniff when I get up\nOn the balcony drunk\nLike the world is mine\nStaggering inside with my robe untied\n\nSo fuck waiting round\nNigga I\u2019m about to get it\nDog I\u2019m tryna eat\nSo I\u2019m staying in the kitchen\nHunched over the stove\nGotta water water whip it\nLost in the sauce but a nigga still stirring\nPacking up them bags but a nigga ain't tripping\nLost in the sauce but a nigga still dipping\nLost on the sauce but a nigga ain\u2019t flipping\nCutting up the hard like the yard ain\u2019t filling\n\nI'm like Spielberg\nWith ill words and hoes on that curb\nGotta screw loose\nI'm cuckoo\nMentally disturbed\nBut still smart enough\nTo hit this bitch wit a rubber\nAnd with ya wrinkle pussy\nHoe can\u2019t be ya lover\nBut I still get the head\nIf you swallow with bubbles\nI'm a Linwood nigga I done traveled the world\nMade a name for myself use to serve on the curb\nNow my words worth a bird\nI could front you a zip\nMade a million in a year and I still ain\u2019t trip\nBout to put my niggas on make a million for them\nShow you that you can make it without acting like them\nDo you lil nigga go out there and just get it\nGotta have a hardback\nBecause these niggas gon\u2019 whip it\nDo you lil nigga get up out there get it\nGotta have a hardback\nBecause these niggas gon\u2019 whip it\n\nSo fuck waiting round\nNigga I\u2019m about to get it\nDog I\u2019m tryna eat\nSo I\u2019m staying in the kitchen\nHunched over the stove\nGotta water water whip it\nLost in the sauce but a nigga still stirring\nPacking up them bags but a nigga ain't tripping\nLost in the sauce but a nigga still dipping\nLost on the sauce but a nigga ain\u2019t flipping\nCutting up the

you\nMask like the phantom, mothafucka, I will stab you\nEver seen a nigga with nothing to lose?\nDesert Eagle cocked and it's aimed at you\nTemper running short, cause his daughter missing meals\nRunning low on options gotta get it with the steel\nNiggas got pills, but we ain't Morpheus\nPosted in the hood, 40 on the porch with us\nNigga what's good? What you don't know?\nGet your free tickets to tonight's murder show\nSo if you want to come through holla at me\nGet your VIP RSVP, nigga, Metal Gear Solid\n\nThis raps like Metal Gear Solid, nigga, I'm Snake\nI detect bitch nigga in your blood trait\nNigga you are dog-bait, show you how a slug taste\nLittle cockroaches get hit with the bug spray\nSorta like Subway, nigga losing weight\nFront his ass to work, now you asking where we stay\nGive his ass the pump like 10 on 8\nNow we leave with pieces like birthday cake\nYou are not straight, nigga, you are gay\nMy hair long like Rappin' 4-Tay\nYour bitch wanna braid it, say she got skills\nBut she's just fishing, want me to fill her gills\nNigga I'mma chill, I ain't really stunting you\nMeat on her grill, just like a barbecue\nBetter call a audible, switch up your plays\nThat shit you running get you Blitz 2K\nI throw bullets right in the flesh\nIf you intercept, you got shot\nHit you with some shit that you ain't coming back from\nBrown tight like six niggas in a Maxima\n40 count I see 'em holding drunk calcium\nCause your bones ain't breaking we cracking 'em\nWhite sheets wrapping 'em\nIt's over it's a wrap for 'em, a

this shit\nCuff my balls, Suck my dick\nNigga I'm the shit, call me Pull-ups\nAnd when the hoes see me, they all pull up\nThey take a flick with me, My pic in her iPhone\nTen seconds later, my dick in her jaw bone\nAnd she say \"Ow, it feels good\"\nShe says \"Brown, you're so hood\"\nSo what's good? Whatcha don't know?\nI like my ho fast that ride dick slow\nBitches online, I call 'em free throws\nShoot it on her like Jordan on Craig Ehlo\nNigga no homo, Nigga I'm him\nRap like Three Stacks mixed with Em, where's Kim?\nProbably in the D just like me\nIf you fight like Bruce Lee, I'mma kill you in your sleep\nCause I'm your favorite rapper, favorite rapper, favorite rapper\nYou're fake candy

truck sitting high like proper etiquette\nIller than I ever been, blowing on that medicine\nUsed to have dreams of copping cribs on Edison...\nNow I'm doing shit thought I never could afford\nArt on the wall like science project boards\nParquet floor, green like Celtic\nFurniture you touch be like whats this velvet?\nUsed to play the block with the sack by the pelvis\nFiends ODing on they toilet like Elvis\n\nSo now I kill beats, so much coroners pick up notepad sheets\nBullhead skinnies Hilfiger fleece, sort of like a futuristic 1993\nA lot my niggas dead, a lot my niggas locked\nA lot my niggas left and moved on from the block\nSome of my niggas here and some got guap\nAnd some may gotta piss in a mothafuckin' pot\nWe used to play the block, we never get old\nThe fridge ain't got shit but the bread with the mold\nAnd some ain't got shoes just the ones with the holes\nThe one you call talkers with the fucking plastic soles\nSo now we change the system to shit we can't afford and\nCheck from Mickey D's can't buy a pair of Jordans\nAnd hot boys gotta get it how they live\n\nClose your eyes, I'm 'bout to take you to a city\nIt ain't pretty, it ain't nowhere to go (It ain't nowhere to go)\nRun and hide when you on the other side\nIt ain't easy, it ain't nowhere to go (It ain't nowhere to go)\nLand of misery a place full of history\nBut seriously, it's nowhere to go (It's nowhere to go)\n\nI seen my nigga Luck before he went up for life\nHe said, Brown you nice and nigga send your sacrifice\nChill on the streets, it ain't here for ya\nCause when you get locked, nobody care for ya\nDid a little time ain't make a phone call\nBook stay thick like a church going broad\nLocked in the county ain't never seen a thorough\nNow I hit the thrift stores cop a vintage polo\nNever talk loud to get my point across\nThe only alligator that I rock is Lacoste\nDetroit player, word to my nigga Big\nPlay this type of shit while you rocking up for Big\nCause I blow two blunts before I brush my teeth\nAin't seen what they looking like but I'm smoking good\nEating better, so I stay full\nJ stay paid, Brown do too", "image":

proper etiquette\nIller than I ever been, blowing on that medicine\nUsed to have dreams of copping cribs on Edison...\nNow I'm doing shit thought I never could afford\nArt on the wall like science project boards\nParquet floor, green like Celtic\nFurniture you touch be like whats this velvet?\nUsed to play the block with the sack by the pelvis\nFiends ODing on they toilet like Elvis\n\nSo now I kill beats, so much coroners pick up notepad sheets\nBullhead skinnies Hilfiger fleece, sort of like a futuristic 1993\nA lot my niggas dead, a lot my niggas locked\nA lot my niggas left and moved on from the block\nSome of my niggas here and some got guap\nAnd some may gotta piss in a mothafuckin' pot\nWe used to play the block, we never get old\nThe fridge ain't got shit but the bread with the mold\nAnd some ain't got shoes just the ones with the holes\nThe one you call talkers with the fucking plastic soles\nSo now we change the system to shit we can't afford and\nCheck from Mickey D's can't buy a pair of Jordans\nAnd hot boys gotta get it how they live\n\nClose your eyes, I'm 'bout to take you to a city\nIt ain't pretty, it ain't nowhere to go (It ain't nowhere to go)\nRun and hide when you on the other side\nIt ain't easy, it ain't nowhere to go (It ain't nowhere to go)\nLand of misery a place full of history\nBut seriously, it's nowhere to go (It's nowhere to go)\n\nI seen my nigga Luck before he went up for life\nHe said, Brown you nice and nigga send your sacrifice\nChill on the streets, it ain't here for ya\nCause when you get locked, nobody care for ya\nDid a little time ain't make a phone call\nBook stay thick like a church going broad\nLocked in the county ain't never seen a thorough\nNow I hit the thrift stores cop a vintage polo\nNever talk loud to get my point across\nThe only alligator that I rock is Lacoste\nDetroit player, word to my nigga Big\nPlay this type of shit while you rocking up for Big\nCause I blow two blunts before I brush my teeth\nAin't seen what they looking like but I'm smoking good\nEating better, so I stay full\nJ stay paid, Brown do too"}}, {"title": "ODB", "album": null, "year": "2013-01-01", "lyrics": "Take

kids, you can see my ribs\nHunger pains since the days of having stains on my bib\nUsed the same passion to put the 'caine on the strip\nUsed the same thirst when I put the bang in the whip\nWhoever thought that I would make it with bars?\nUsed to give fiends ? just to borrow the car\nI was just a teenager down on my luck\nThought Jordans and a gold chain was living it up\nOnly I'd have left mustard stains on my shirt\nKool-Aid and fuego helped clench my thirst\nUsed to live day-to-day and just wait on the first\nThen I lost my first daughter then I seen my work\nHad to take steps back, reconstruct my plan\nStarted rapping up verses, stopped rapping up grams\nFlew out to NY, fucking with my mans\nNow I'm in the Maybach not the back of the van\n\nMy momma used to tell me \"Son, you're gonna make it, one day it'll happen\"\nWho knew I had what it takes to be famous and one day I'd be rapping\nMy poppa used to ask me \"Son, are you prepared cos one day it could happen\"\nI dreamed about this day, but who could've believed that one day I'd be rapping\n\nBack on public transportation\nWaking up in the morning with mason\nMomma in the kitchen cooking eggs and bacon\nGranny gave her last to the preacher man praying\nFor her grandson to make a change\nConstant fiends coming copping with loose change\nWas going down the drain, until I hopped on the beat and unleashed my pain\nI used to watch wrestling, Hex or Jim ?\nPiledrive beats, Dan Brown been thugging\nWhole life been broke, I'ma keep on hustling\nTryna stack up a mill, cop a crib for my cousin\nBut, everywhere you go people wanna hate\nSaying that they ? but they plotting on your plate\nTaught in the streets, I ain't have to graduate\nAnd nigga, I'ma make it just awaiting my day\n\n\nPeople look at my style, momma look at your child\nThey throw my jams on now, watch the crowd go wild\nWe done came a long way form copping on broadway\nLetting the arms spray, I'd walk in in broad day\nNow we entrepreneurs that's concurring tours\nThe only thing left now to do is sell out stores\nBut in the hood, I'm platinum, did good with rapping\nMoney is stacking, done with the slinging and jacking\nNow I write and recite what goes on in my life\nRemember being too scared to come home at night\nCos I would hate to see you and my father fight\nBack then I was a little dude\nThat rock's skips to school and got ridiculed\nQuit the flip and a hit a fool\nAnd I know it's hard, we went through many changes\nTryna raise a son that spoke a different language\nBut had to change my ways cos I was living dangerous",

same passion to put the 'caine on the strip\nUsed the same thirst when I put the bang in the whip\nWhoever thought that I would make it with bars?\nUsed to give fiends ? just to borrow the car\nI was just a teenager down on my luck\nThought Jordans and a gold chain was living it up\nOnly I'd have left mustard stains on my shirt\nKool-Aid and fuego helped clench my thirst\nUsed to live day-to-day and just wait on the first\nThen I lost my first daughter then I seen my work\nHad to take steps back, reconstruct my plan\nStarted rapping up verses, stopped rapping up grams\nFlew out to NY, fucking with my mans\nNow I'm in the Maybach not the back of the van\n\nMy momma used to tell me \"Son, you're gonna make it, one day it'll happen\"\nWho knew I had what it takes to be famous and one day I'd be rapping\nMy poppa used to ask me \"Son, are you prepared cos one day it could happen\"\nI dreamed about this day, but who could've believed that one day I'd be rapping\n\nBack on public transportation\nWaking up in the morning with mason\nMomma in the kitchen cooking eggs and bacon\nGranny gave her last to the preacher man praying\nFor her grandson to make a change\nConstant fiends coming copping with loose change\nWas going down the drain, until I hopped on the beat and unleashed my pain\nI used to watch wrestling, Hex or Jim ?\nPiledrive beats, Dan Brown been thugging\nWhole life been broke, I'ma keep on hustling\nTryna stack up a mill, cop a crib for my cousin\nBut, everywhere you go people wanna hate\nSaying that they ? but they plotting on your plate\nTaught in the streets, I ain't have to graduate\nAnd nigga, I'ma make it just awaiting my day\n\n\nPeople look at my style, momma look at your child\nThey throw my jams on now, watch the crowd go wild\nWe done came a long way form copping on broadway\nLetting the arms spray, I'd walk in in broad day\nNow we entrepreneurs that's concurring tours\nThe only thing left now to do is sell out stores\nBut in the hood, I'm platinum, did good with rapping\nMoney is stacking, done with the slinging and jacking\nNow I write and recite what goes on in my life\nRemember being too scared to come home at night\nCos I would hate to see you and my father fight\nBack then I was a little dude\nThat rock's skips to school and got ridiculed\nQuit the flip and a hit a fool\nAnd I know it's hard, we went through many changes\nTryna raise a son that spoke a different language\nBut had to change my ways cos I was living dangerous"}}, {"title": "Outer Space", "album": "XXX", "year": "2011-08-15", "lyrics": "Meet the

Owens\nFlow sick, nigga, call it pneumonia\nI'm on ya\n\nOld nigga came in this bitch with a new gun\nClip looking like a fucking mile long\nIf that shit hits you close range, ya calzone\nPowder stains on my Balmain\nSlurp that pussy up just like lo mein\nIf that coke burn my nose, I'ma complain\n\nMade 30 bands in 30 minutes\nBefore I count it, I done damn near spent it\nPut a brick on ya in some Rick Owens\nFlow sick, nigga, call it pneumonia\nI'm on ya\nMade 30 bands in 30 minutes\nBefore I count it, I done damn near spent it\nPut a brick on ya in some Rick Owens\nFlow sick, nigga, call it pneumonia\nI'm on ya\n\nI'm smoking dope, I'm smoking dope\nGot a half a pound of artichoke\nScale broke, so we eyeball it\nHer titties out just like New Orleans\nMardi gras, we party hard, she off the soft\nMy dick head, she celebrate like the world end\nAnd she could be my girlfriend\nOnly fuck her on the weekend\nMomma found some racks in some dirty jeans\nTold her keep the money, take 'em to the cleaners\nThreesome watched how this dick came between them\nLicked the clit and she did the Macarena\nCrib in the forest, deer in my yard\n'07, I got locked up on a charge\nNow a nigga got four bank cards\nLooking like a nigga gotta thank God\nGoing through a bag like I'm snatching purses\nHalf a key of raw inside my fucking verses\nLike a surgeon with that scalpel, bring that track to

in her pelvis and now I'm eating sword fish\nBlowin circles of purple knowing nothin's for certain\nFuck the wiser surgeon bust a nut on their curtains\nEveryday always stay on the low like im thirsting\nNiggas handcuffin nurses and buyin em' purses\nFuck buyin em burkins they worthless like cursive\nMy purses is purchest I'm the one that they flirt with\nThe surface is circus clowns\nMy verses is curses\nI cop it and break it down\nThe workers are chirpin\nLeader of the newschool in an old school\nNiggas tofu, bruise off the pro-tools\nRap Meyer Lansky, losing all his sanity\nLayin' on a canopy, thinkin how it can be\nPlayer hating niggas allways blocking like Camby\nTake the mocho out of man now he's just a randy\nBlowin on the candy\nModus operandi\nAdderals and zanny\nAlways come in handy, yeah\nI'm on the streets like a wino\nI see that pussy just like a gyno\nGot these bitches chargin head first like rhino\nRemember when they used to rock madana's with the rhynestones\nNow they lookin like the shitted out a pinecone\nDiamond in the ruff been found and its a fine stone\nFine two flow going over heads ho\nMind been blown ever since she gave me head ho"}},

that top when I hit that butt\nPimp so hard it's a full time job\nSwear, 12 stacks in my garage\nBitch niggas, tell me what it's gon' be\nYoung nigga chop it up 223\nCome to the D, don't hit OGs\nAnd my advice is stay low-key\n\nBitch we great x2\nFuckin' set\nBitch we jump up x2\nWe gotta have it\nWe gotta get it, x2\nWe gonna take it\nBitch we jump x2\nWe gotta make\nGo\n\nCouple racks on them \nYour bitch here smoked my trippy stick\nRidiculous, put dick on tit, spit on clit\nAnd it's over with, I'm over it\nNo sober shit, drink til I just throw up and shit\nY'all ho told me come over

then no show\nCannot tell me nothin'\nShow me somethin' I ain't seen before\nThat hoe want my piccolo\nSmoking on that mistletoe\nMake her kiss all on it\nWhile we chop chop on them 24s\nShe look like a centerfold\nMouth all on my genitals\nSuckin' on it like she gettin' vitamins and minerals\nI be on the chemicals, she be on my testicles\nPoke her with my tentacle then put her out my schedules\nRolling up them vegetables\nRapping with that special flow\nOnly way you're next to blow if you be strapped with C4\nI be fresh from head to toe, every day a fashion show\nUsed to tote that Calico and serve like John McEnroe\nNow I sell out all my shows\nUsed to sell out all my blow\nThat was back when we was coppin' dubs to try and roll up 4\nNow a nigga livin' good\nI done made it out the hood\nThink I'm goin' back?\nI wish a motherfucker would\n\nYeah, they say I got the city on fire\nI ain't boomin', that's a goddamn lie, woah\nReally doe, like really doe\nReally doe, like really doe\nThey say I got the city on fire\nI ain't boomin', that's a goddamn lie, woah\nReally doe, like really doe\nReally doe, like really doe\n\nStill wicked as Aleister, Crowley niggas know me well\nFor heaven's sake, I'm the GOAT, you haters can go to hell\nWhen you're getting money, nigga, every day is sunny\nI'ma act an ass on that donkey, let her pull my ponytail\nSecond grade, took my mama weddin' ring, took that bitch\nTo show-and-tell, now I'm married to the game to no avail\nGrounded me for like a month, now I'm gettin' high as fuck\nEmployer tryna write me up, but now I'm a writer\nWith ambitions of a rider, and half the shit on my rider I don't even want, the Fanta's for us, the Henny's for the sluts (chyeah)\nGivenchy bikers with the rev rips\nBalmain badmon, Bathing Ape on my dick\nPaid by the Bloods, raised by the Crips\nSoulo Ho3 the prophecies, atrocities, exhibition\nOh yeah, now a nigga livin' good\nBut good could be better I wish a motherfucker would\n\nYeah, they say I got the city on fire\nI ain't boomin', that's a goddamn lie, woah\nReally doe, like really doe\nReally doe, like really doe\nThey say I got the city on fire\nI ain't boomin', that's a goddamn lie, woah\nReally doe, like really doe\nReally doe, like really doe\n\nLife is like an appetite of truth and dare, I double dare ya\nLife to end in vain before the end is near\nSee I can hear you crying\nSilence sittin' in the dark\nHoldin' crosses 'cross your heart\nSin is such a work of art\nWatch out for the love lost\n\nBet a thousand, shoot a thousand\nThings a nigga do for thousands\nMade a million counting sheep\nGave it all to public housin'\nTaking off to Abu Dhabi\nBeamin' up the motor, Scotty\nTalking to promoters, Scotty\nEverybody know it's Gotti\nMurder one, you've heard of them\nThe rev undid, the all day madness\nGot it off the wipe it off, the evidence, the blood on mattress\nBig power, big stages\nMy zoo cannot fit the cages\nThis booth is not used to fakin'\nMy crew just love confrontation\nI chewed the face off the laces\nI moved the weight from the waitress\nI chef the pot that made poison\nI cooked then kicked all the patients\nMy bitch is way beyond basic\nThat's life insurance, car insurance, good pussy insurance\nAyy, look what we're enduring\nAyy, ridin' in foreigns\nAyy, K-Dot, four years, I got the same watch\nBut it's the real watch and that bitch fire\nSpeed Racer waitin' outside\nThe roof on it like a tank top\nCountin' money, watchin' paint dry\nWhen I'm done is when the rain stops, uh\n\nThey say I got the city on fire\nI ain't boomin', that's a goddamn lie, woah\nReally doe, like really doe\nReally doe, like really doe\nThey say I got the city on fire\nI ain't boomin', that's a goddamn lie, woah\nReally doe, like really doe\nReally doe, like really doe\n\nGood, hood\nI wish you motherfuckin' would\nListen, wish a motherfucker would, Brown\nI had to put my foot down\nIt's like I'm popping a clutch\nYour hate palpable, your jaw full of dust\nYou gon' keep talkin' or are we lockin' it up?\nAnd I'm the type of nigga it ain't never been an honor to judge\nYou a mouse that the falcon picked up\nSo disrespect will get you checked like the top of the month\nI was a liar as a kid so now I'm honest as fuck\nAnd I never pass my mama no blunt\nAnd kept my hair straight\nListen deadweight never been a problem to dunk\nLook, I just broke up with my bitch cause we ain't argue enough\nI keep it dirty as a spliff my uncle Alchemist puff\nI strike a birdie on 'em, while I hit your mouth with the club\nI wake up early on 'em, gettin' out the house is a must\nIt's like a sweaty pit, sweaty sick, countin' your dubs\nEither that or you gon' catch me on a mountain with monks\nLoungin', ask your girl why her mouth on my nuts\nYou've been the same motherfucker since 2001\nWell it's the left-handed shooter, Kyle Lowry the pump\nI'm at your house like, \"Why you got your couch on my Chucks?\"\nMotherfucker",

want my piccolo\nSmoking on that mistletoe\nMake her kiss all on it\nWhile we chop chop on them 24s\nShe look like a centerfold\nMouth all on my genitals\nSuckin' on it like she gettin' vitamins and minerals\nI be on the chemicals, she be on my testicles\nPoke her with my tentacle then put her out my schedules\nRolling up them vegetables\nRapping with that special flow\nOnly way you're next to blow if you be strapped with C4\nI be fresh from head to toe, every day a fashion show\nUsed to tote that Calico and serve like John McEnroe\nNow I sell out all my shows\nUsed to sell out all my blow\nThat was back when we was coppin' dubs to try and roll up 4\nNow a nigga livin' good\nI done made it out the hood\nThink I'm goin' back?\nI wish a motherfucker would\n\nYeah, they say I got the city on fire\nI ain't boomin', that's a goddamn lie, woah\nReally doe, like really doe\nReally doe, like really doe\nThey say I got the city on fire\nI ain't boomin', that's a goddamn lie, woah\nReally doe, like really doe\nReally doe, like really doe\n\nStill wicked as Aleister, Crowley niggas know me well\nFor heaven's sake, I'm the GOAT, you haters can go to hell\nWhen you're getting money, nigga, every day is sunny\nI'ma act an ass on that donkey, let her pull my ponytail\nSecond grade, took my mama weddin' ring, took that bitch\nTo show-and-tell, now I'm married to the game to no avail\nGrounded me for like a month, now I'm gettin' high as fuck\nEmployer tryna write me up, but now I'm a writer\nWith ambitions of a rider, and half the shit on my rider I don't even want, the Fanta's for us, the Henny's for the sluts (chyeah)\nGivenchy bikers with the rev rips\nBalmain badmon, Bathing Ape on my dick\nPaid by the Bloods, raised by the Crips\nSoulo Ho3 the prophecies, atrocities, exhibition\nOh yeah, now a nigga livin' good\nBut good could be better I wish a motherfucker would\n\nYeah, they say I got the city on fire\nI ain't boomin', that's a goddamn lie, woah\nReally doe, like really doe\nReally doe, like really doe\nThey say I got the city on fire\nI ain't boomin', that's a goddamn lie, woah\nReally doe, like really doe\nReally doe, like really doe\n\nLife is like an appetite of truth and dare, I double dare ya\nLife to end in vain before the end is near\nSee I can hear you crying\nSilence sittin' in the dark\nHoldin' crosses 'cross your heart\nSin is such a work of art\nWatch out for the love lost\n\nBet a thousand, shoot a thousand\nThings a nigga do for thousands\nMade a million counting sheep\nGave it all to public housin'\nTaking off to Abu Dhabi\nBeamin' up the motor, Scotty\nTalking to promoters, Scotty\nEverybody know it's Gotti\nMurder one, you've heard of them\nThe rev undid, the all day madness\nGot it off the wipe it off, the evidence, the blood on mattress\nBig power, big stages\nMy zoo cannot fit the cages\nThis booth is not used to fakin'\nMy crew just love confrontation\nI chewed the face off the laces\nI moved the weight from the waitress\nI chef the pot that made poison\nI cooked then kicked all the patients\nMy bitch is way beyond basic\nThat's life insurance, car insurance, good pussy insurance\nAyy, look what we're enduring\nAyy, ridin' in foreigns\nAyy, K-Dot, four years, I got the same watch\nBut it's the real watch and that bitch fire\nSpeed Racer waitin' outside\nThe roof on it like a tank top\nCountin' money, watchin' paint dry\nWhen I'm done is when the rain stops, uh\n\nThey say I got the city on fire\nI ain't boomin', that's a goddamn lie, woah\nReally doe, like really doe\nReally doe, like really doe\nThey say I got the city on fire\nI ain't boomin', that's a goddamn lie, woah\nReally doe, like really doe\nReally doe, like really doe\n\nGood, hood\nI wish you motherfuckin' would\nListen, wish a motherfucker would, Brown\nI had to put my foot down\nIt's like I'm popping a clutch\nYour hate palpable, your jaw full of dust\nYou gon' keep talkin' or are we lockin' it up?\nAnd I'm the type of nigga it ain't never been an honor to judge\nYou a mouse that the falcon picked up\nSo disrespect will get you checked like the top of the month\nI was a liar as a kid so now I'm honest as fuck\nAnd I never pass my mama no blunt\nAnd kept my hair straight\nListen deadweight never been a problem to dunk\nLook, I just broke up with my bitch cause we ain't argue enough\nI keep it dirty as a spliff my uncle Alchemist puff\nI strike a birdie on 'em, while I hit your mouth with the club\nI wake up early on 'em, gettin' out the house is a must\nIt's like a sweaty pit, sweaty sick, countin' your dubs\nEither that or you gon' catch me on a mountain with monks\nLoungin', ask your girl why her mouth on my nuts\nYou've been the same motherfucker since 2001\nWell it's the left-handed shooter, Kyle Lowry the pump\nI'm at your house like, \"Why you got your couch on my Chucks?\"\nMotherfucker"}}, {"title": "Red 2 Go", "album": "Old ", "year": "2013-10-10",

If you not, you tripping\nAnd you? You ain't dope enough\nThe 50 Caliber will crack your whole coconut\nUh no milk, just the cherry filling\nShoot a hater in the head, yeah it's very thrilling\nI'm in a European car, panoramic

they mouth\nSmoke some weed, order Coney, time to fuck and out\nRock a fit for three days and go and cop a new one\nRode a bike to Linwood to give away my ones\nHopped up out the cab, and when I step out\nThe first thing they say \"I ain't know them came out\"\nBut nigga I ain't tripping, I'm grinding on a few bucks\nReally balling and I'm tryna step it up"}}, {"title": "Rolling Stone", "album": "Atrocity Exhibition", "year": "2016-09-15", "lyrics": "You know I'm living like a rolling stone\nBut don't feel for me\nYou know I'm in my zone\nSo don't speak to me\nAnd in my mind I just feel so alone\nJust release me\n\nFeeling like I got money\nKnow I'm just nigga rich\nEven if she fuck me\nI still know life a bitch\nBought a nightmare, sold a dream\nHappiness went upstream\nBlame myself, I had no control\nNow I'm living with no soul\nI'm on a road that never ends\nDon't know opposite of sin\nSome people say I think too much\nI don't think they think enough\nTime rough but it got rougher\nWeight heavier up on my shoulders\nLiving crooked 'til it's over\nCan't be straight, can't be sober\nThought process so immature\nCan't make it up, up out the sewer\nFeeling like there's no hope\nBlaze dope, my mind float\nI love her, she love me\nLove ain't enough with no bucks\nFucked up, that's the way it is\nI don't know who I should trust\nRiding around with the windows up\nSmoking like it's ten of us\nJust me in the back seat\nWith the driver bumping them Isleys\nI'm walking on this long road\nWill I come back?\nHomie, I don't even really know\n\nYou know I'm living like a rolling stone\nBut don't feel for me\nYou know I'm in my zone\nSo don't speak to me\nAnd in my mind I just feel so alone\nJust release me\n\nFeeling like I'm not alive\nBut I know I'm not dead\nLiving lies but can't hide\nDeep inside, the truth dies\nBought hope, can't get change\nLost my brain, going insane\nSelf-medicate is how I cope\nLeave my body, soul go afloat\nOn a roll that never ends\nDon't know where I should begin\nFeeling trapped, no looking back\nHead first in that deep end\nLiving like a rolling stone\nWhen I die, I leave alone\nGetting high, I feel low\nBut we all know life goes on\n\nYou know I'm living like a rolling stone\nBut don't feel for me\nYou know I'm in my zone\nSo don't speak to me\nAnd in my mind I just feel so alone\nJust re-\n\nAll that I know\nAll that I know is to feel your shame\n'Cause you can't let go\n'Cause you can't let go, you drive me insane\nBut will I ever find my way?\nOr go back to the beginning\nThere's a thing that I know for sure", "image": "https://images.genius.com/e9067c502652d80f1825b3c3e8cd07bf.620x620x1.jpg", "artist": "Danny Brown", "raw": {"annotation_count": 17, "api_path": "/songs/2840842", "description":

with no soul\nI'm on a road that never ends\nDon't know opposite of sin\nSome people say I think too much\nI don't think they think enough\nTime rough but it got rougher\nWeight heavier up on my shoulders\nLiving crooked 'til it's over\nCan't be straight, can't be sober\nThought process so immature\nCan't make it up, up out the sewer\nFeeling like there's no hope\nBlaze dope, my mind float\nI love her, she love me\nLove ain't enough with no bucks\nFucked up, that's the way it is\nI don't know who I should trust\nRiding around with the windows up\nSmoking like it's ten of us\nJust me in the back seat\nWith the driver bumping them Isleys\nI'm walking on this long road\nWill I come back?\nHomie, I don't even really know\n\nYou know I'm living like a rolling stone\nBut don't feel for

the truth dies\nBought hope, can't get change\nLost my brain, going insane\nSelf-medicate is how I cope\nLeave my body, soul go afloat\nOn a roll that never ends\nDon't know where I should begin\nFeeling trapped, no looking back\nHead first in that deep end\nLiving like a rolling stone\nWhen I die, I leave alone\nGetting high, I feel low\nBut we all know life goes on\n\nYou know I'm living like a rolling stone\nBut don't feel for me\nYou know I'm in my zone\nSo don't speak to me\nAnd in my mind I just feel so alone\nJust re-\n\nAll that I know\nAll that I know is to feel your

put out last month\nMy uncle sniffing blow while I'm rolling up a blunt\nHis homie in the basement smoking crack with my aunt\nAnd tonight's that night we 'bout to get right\nPiled up in a van with a couple flashlights\nMetal crowbars gon' get us through the door\nTake everything nigga, fuck the landlord\nSo now we at the place skullys on bareface\n'Bout to leave this bitch bare and strip the whole place\nMy unc took outside he ripping down the gutters\nSo we inside tearing up this mothafucka\nBust open the walls just to get the wiring\nTook the hot water tank and leftover appliances\nAluminum siding and had to come back\nCause the furnace so big, it wouldn't fit in the back\n\nNow it's copper by the pound, wire by the inch\nGot a check on the first and it's gone by the fifth\nScrap or die, nigga\nAnd you might be laughing at it cause you know the shit is true\nRusty flat bed truck the color of doo-doo\nScrap or die, nigga\n\nEarly morning next day at the junkyard\nGot four loads 'bout to get broke off\nBut these niggas slick man, I swear I'm going off\nPut the work on the scale and I swear that bitch was off\nCause I know we had way more than that\nBut fuck it, split it up ay I get more than that\nThese niggas always slick on that bullshit\nCheat you out a couple bucks on some dope fiend shit\nSo we back in the hood, plot the next lick\nGot a school closed down and I think we should hit it\nJust waiting on my unc to get back from the clinic\nAnd we gone go over there to see what's up with it\nNow we up in it taking old computers\nUntil we fucking heard \"Don't move or I shoot ya\"\nFucked up the hook caught us tryna cash in\nNow we gotta B&E case of trespassing\n\nNow it's copper by the pound, wire by the inch\nGot a check on the first and it's gone by the fifth\nScrap or die, nigga\nAnd you might be laughing at it cause you know the shit is true\nRusty flat bed truck the color of doo-doo\nScrap or die,

touch you make your shoes curl\nBend you over, lick your  girl\nSip that good wine and make the room swirl\nYour ass out of control\nSo move girl, till the sun up, sun up\nSwitch your hairdo out when its done up, done up\nSo sexy when you dance and you like your ass smacked\nNasty girl want to get it all up in that clap trap\nPlus I do all that wild shit you like\nMake them bust every time, ain't nothing different tonight\nI want to push all your buttons\nYou gotta be the shit\nWhen your tush starts to  it's busting out the most\nJelly shaker, remind me of the sandwich toast\nGive them a piece

rolling up the tree\nWearing jackets in the house, it's a Michigan winter\nBoiling water on the stove, Ramen noodles for dinner\nDope fiends out the halfway house and they still sniffing\nHomie mommy's 50, smoking and still tricking\nStill talking shit with this loosie I'm ass-licking\nSee my breath when I talk, but nigga, I ain't tripping\nLandlord is, the nigga tryna put us out\nSelling all the samples, can't afford to give 'em out\nJust copped a half-track, see my nigga tryna get it\nStanding on the baseline, Scottie Pippen pivot\nNeedles in they arms just to keep the lights on\nShit, fuck around, be on hardcore pawn\nTryna get this shit off, the window, we snuck in\nWon't live for anything, but might die for nothing\n\nThey want that old Danny Brown\nTo bag up and sell a whole pound\nMight have to go and get my braids back\nMatter of fact, go and bring them AK's back\nThey want that old Danny Brown\nTo bag up and sell a whole pound\nMight have to go and get my braids back\nMatter of fact, go and bring them AK's back\n\nIn the Cutty same color as steak sauce\nEyeballed the work, but was just a .8 off\nVet in the game, first seed in the playoffs\nMeet me at the Coney, gotta get this weight off\nBalmains fitting like a nigga went swimming in 'em\nI'm waxed and I'm shining, hardwood floor\nWhore want it hardcore, squirt it on her jaw\nLooking at the whore like \"What you came here for?\"\nLinwood nigga, heat on him, no stash box\nTurn a gangbanger's bandana to a rag top\nOld head, dope fiend, cooking up the yay\nYoung boys'll shoot your face for them Cartiers\nCame a long way taking three for a nick'\nCop an 8 ball, tryna stack for the zip\nNow I'm in the rap game, verse worth a brick\nFiends lining up for a hit of this shit\n(And I reps that shit, right now and forever)\n\nThey want that old Danny Brown\nTo bag up and sell a whole pound\nMight have to go and get my braids back\nMatter of fact, go and bring them AK's back\nThey want that old Danny Brown\nTo bag up and sell a whole pound\nMight have to go and get my braids back\nMatter of fact, go and bring them AK's back"}}, {"title": "Side B (Dope Song)", "album": "Old ", "year":

lobby\nNigga popping NoDoz, selling rocks as a hobby\nBankroll in my pocket, so everybody know me\nWent home and gave my momma three hundred for some groceries\nWe hit the mall and ball, hit the club and spend it all\nNow I'm back to Square A with them squares to get off\n\nDope Song\nDope Song\nDope Song\n(My last)\nDope Song\nDope Song\nDope Song\n(My last)\nDope Song\nDope Song\nDope Song\n(My last)\nDope Song\nDope Song\nDope Song\n\nCrackhead Lisa, she used to be thick\nHad sex with a trick, and now she sick\nShe offer you some head, if you give her some drugs\nJust make sure you when you hit it (You better wear a glove)\nI'm sick of all these niggas with their ten-year-old stories\nYou ain't doing that no more, nigga lying to the shorty\nSo take this as a diss song, cause this is my last song\nNot my last dope song, but my last dope song\n\nDope Song\nDope Song\nDope Song\n(My last)\nDope Song\nDope Song\nDope Song\n(My last)\nDope Song\nDope Song\nDope Song\n(My last)\nDope

sun shine\nWatching time while I'm watching infomercials\nNothing else is on so I'm rolling up the purple\nHope it takes me straight to dreams 'cause all I seem to have is nightmares\nWaking up in cold sweat punching on the nightstand\nWish i could wake in a puddle of my drool\nBut when i fall asleep i see myself in a pool of blood\nAnd whats fucked up is if ain't that, the sounds of gunshots are waking me up\nIs it paranoia? tell me how? blocks so foul that a nigga getting shot right now\nSo I roll with the chrone, put 'em where Michael Jackson and say you are not alone\nAnd I can't really call it, when you wanna take a shit and roaches crawling up out your toilet\nWhen you looking out the window, it's snowing in august\nIf you rolling with the circle always looking like a target\nSo I'm always DOLO, call me anti-social\nUnless it bisexual bitches that's bicoastal\nCall me what you want, call me a motherfucker\n'cause i do it for the kids here because of broke rubbers\nKnow its so hard, playing in the D you see nut dripping out of condoms hanging off of monkey bars\nNowhere to go, and outside sounds like the Saving Private Ryan first scene audio\nYeah you hear the sirens, hear the shots echo\nSoundtrack the violence when you open up your window\nFrom where you can't blink and all the madness in the street won't let me get a wink\n\nPlease just let me sleep\n'cause the sounds on the streets won't let me get a peep\nSo i fall deep, but not falling six feet deep, so underneath the bed sheets where I keep the heat\nStreets won't let me chill\nEvery morning I'm awake, gotta pop another pill\nSo hard to deal, living with this stress\nPressure won't let me rest\n\nI'm just trying to catch the last letter in the alphabet\nAnd what's outside might get a niggas numbers\nAin't gotta be summer in D, we got heat\nZero below got shit to melt your teeth\nBody want to sleep but the mind's not ready yet\nThoughts tortured like a Vietnam vet\nAll the horror i endured during my adolescent\nGot me dependent on these anti-depressant\nFrom the highest rate of crime\nNiggas talk murder but they wouldn't kill time\nIt sound good in your rhyme\n'till your sitting in that car in that funeral line\nAnd theres tears in your eyes, wearing all black\nCan't do shit, so hard to fight back\n'Cause you know your niggas ghosts\nAnd I'mma sleep and still be having dreams about my nigga Louis\nTelling me to stay cold, then I await to blood running up out my stuffy nose\nAnd it be so cold, that I be sweating, so much that it always have my braids wet",

"lyrics": "Laying here eyes wide television lights up the room\nLike the moon in the nighttime, minds on another daytime\nProbably have that same thought until the next sun shine\nWatching time while I'm watching infomercials\nNothing else is on so I'm rolling up the purple\nHope it takes me straight to dreams 'cause all I seem to have is nightmares\nWaking up in cold sweat punching on the nightstand\nWish i could wake in a puddle of my drool\nBut when i fall asleep i see myself in a pool of blood\nAnd whats fucked up is if ain't that, the sounds of gunshots are waking me up\nIs it paranoia? tell me how? blocks so foul that a nigga getting shot right now\nSo I roll with the chrone, put 'em where Michael Jackson and say you are not alone\nAnd I can't really call it, when you wanna take a shit and roaches crawling up out your toilet\nWhen you looking out the window, it's snowing in august\nIf you rolling with the circle always looking like a target\nSo I'm always DOLO, call me anti-social\nUnless it bisexual bitches that's bicoastal\nCall me what you want, call me a motherfucker\n'cause i do it for the kids here because of broke rubbers\nKnow its so hard, playing in the D you see nut dripping out of condoms hanging off of monkey bars\nNowhere to go, and outside sounds like the Saving Private Ryan first scene audio\nYeah you hear the sirens, hear the shots echo\nSoundtrack the violence when you open up your window\nFrom where you can't blink and all the madness in the street won't let me get a wink\n\nPlease just let me sleep\n'cause the sounds on the streets won't let me get a peep\nSo i fall deep, but not falling six feet deep, so underneath the bed sheets where I keep the heat\nStreets won't let me chill\nEvery morning I'm awake, gotta pop another pill\nSo hard to deal, living with this stress\nPressure won't let me rest\n\nI'm just trying to catch the last letter in the alphabet\nAnd what's outside might get a niggas numbers\nAin't gotta be summer in D, we got heat\nZero below got shit to melt your teeth\nBody want to sleep but the mind's not ready yet\nThoughts tortured like a Vietnam vet\nAll the horror i endured during my adolescent\nGot me dependent on these anti-depressant\nFrom the highest rate of crime\nNiggas talk murder but they wouldn't kill time\nIt sound good in your rhyme\n'till your sitting in that car in that funeral line\nAnd theres tears in your eyes, wearing all black\nCan't do shit, so hard to fight back\n'Cause you know your niggas ghosts\nAnd I'mma sleep and still be having dreams about my nigga Louis\nTelling me to stay cold, then I await to blood running up out my stuffy nose\nAnd it be so cold, that I be sweating, so much that it always have my braids wet"}}, {"title": "Smokin' and

stack, and my shoes cost 'bout half of that\nLet's not talk 'bout the shirt, she can't even pronounce that\nGhetto Nigga in high end, my Theory is Low End\nMy Tribe on a Quest, put that money in motion\nSo bitch, we smoking and drink, drinking and smoke\nMy ho got tats on her face, sell me them cookies from Oakland\nBut not the kind that you eat, stuff it in Swisher Sweets\nAnd we smoke blunt after blunt, after blunt, after blunt, after blunt, after blunt, after blunt, after blunt\n\nI don't know what y'all be thinking\nSpaced-out, rolling up that stinky\nBig-big blunts the size of pinkies\nPour one out, we still be leaning\nI don't know what y'all be thinking\nSmoking, drinking, drinking, smoking\nIn that order, we slow motion\n'til it's over, never stop\n\nSmoking and drink,

kush to the face\nGotta get away, get away, I think I need to pray\nPlease, oh Lord, oh Lord, I need your help again\nTook too many pills and I think I hear my heart beating\nTaking over those chances, honey backwoods stuffed with that grammy\nMy ho blowing that powder, mixing liquor with them Xannies\nStress party, get away, hope that these problems just go away\nRight there in my face, I ignore it every day\nI be\nSmoking and drink, drinking and smoke\nWe be smoking and drink, drinking and smoke\nWe be smoking and drink, drinking and smoke\nWe be smoking and drink, drinking and

Why's that?\nDanny Brown: I was getting too fat, man, I gained like fifteen pounds.\nTim Westwood: For real?\nDanny Brown: Yeah, I like wearing Balmain jeans and Rick Owens t-shirts. You can't wear Rick Owens looking pregnant, you know what I'm saying? You can't have the Gucci Mane belly, man, to wear high-end fashion, you know what I'm saying? So one of 'em had to go.\nTim Westwood: Yeah, yeah, and for real, I mean, Gucci brought that little fucking belly into fashion, uh, why he continued it, the -\nDanny Brown: You know, that look cool when you wear Coogi t-shirts and stuff, but once you start putting on -\nTim Westwood: Tight shit, then you look like a skinny little fat guy.\nDanny Brown: yes and it's the worst.\nTim Westwood: So why was syrup making you fat?\nDanny Brown: It's the sugar, you're drinking a lot of sugar. I might drink a 2-liter of soda a day by myself. That's just too much soda to be drinking a day.\nTim Westwood: Coming off the syrup, how long did you feel it took to get your mind off of it?\nDanny Brown: About two weeks. I mean your stomach is just real fucked up. That's what's so nasty about it, everyone's talking about sipping syrup but if you don't have syrup for three days your might shit on yourself.\nTim Westwood: Oh it's that bad?\nDanny Brown: You can't hold it. It's diarrhea. But then, this is the other side is if you drink too much, you become constipated and you can't take a shit. That's why Gucci Mane's belly was like that, it wasn't that he was fat it's that he was bloated. There was mad turds up in there.\nTim Westwood: He was backed up!\nDanny Brown: This is true though. So it's nasty, to all the kids who think drinking syrup is cool, don't get me wrong it tastes amazing and it might help you sleep at night, but all the other side effects, it's not worth it.\nTim Westwood: So the bloated stomach, putting on the weight, being backed up like a mother fucker-\nDanny Brown: And then if you don't have it, you gotta shit like crazy. You can't hold anything. You might as well get some Imodium A-D and keep them in your pocket like peppermints. Literally as soon as you start eating. You might not even have nothing in your stomach, just a couple drops of water. A lot of people listening think it's like a glamorous thing, it's not man!\nTim Westwood: I can't even imagine, if I were gonna come off the syrup I'd be scared to fart.\nDanny Brown: But that's why people continue to drink. And then you have some people that drink all the time and talk about it but you don't see the signs of that. So I think there's a lot of punks, I think there's a lot of studio sipping.\nTim Westwood: You think so?\nDanny Brown: They talk about but they ain't about it.\nTim Westwood: They ain't about it.\nDanny Brown: Yeah. They just promoting it. At the end of the day, yeah, it is for no reason.\nTim Westwood: With that, sleeping is good though?\nDanny Brown: Yeah and it was good for me to sleep, you're traveling to different time zones, you'd just be messed up, and then you have to go back out. So to go home and sleep for two days that would be great for me.\nTim Westwood: That's how crazy it is, you just sleep for hours?\nDanny Brown: Yeah I would probably sleep like ten hours. Just out, real deep sleep. You don't even know you sleep. That's the thing, that's why a lot of people die in they sleep because of some habit while you sleep. If something weird were to happen while you sleep and you can't take care of it.\nTim Westwood: And sometimes, man, you just shut down in your sleep, everything just shuts down.\nDanny Brown: Now I just take a Xanax, man.  drinking two-liters of soda, you know, shitting on myself everywhere. You trying to bring lean to Africa with you. Just 'cause you don't want to get sick.\nTim Westwood: So you have to travel with some lean?\nDanny Brown: All the time! Last time I was with you I was drinking lean, remember?\nTim Westwood: How do you travel with quantities of lean?\nDanny Brown: Because you can take three ounces of liquid on a plane. You know, you can buy those travel things, just put three ounces in there. It could be shampoo, they don't know what it is, and if they do find it, it's my cough syrup. I had a big bottle I had to break -\nTim Westwood: Just break it out-\nDanny Brown: And get through. But then you ain't out there drinking to be drinking, you out there to get your stomach right.\nTim Westwood: Maintain and self-medicate.\nDanny Brown: It's nasty, though. So, don't drink lean, kids, don't drink lean.\nTim Westwood: So, you think lean should go down the sink?\nDanny Brown: Yes. I don't think it should be a drug that's glorified. It's liquid heroin, it's an opiate.\nTim Westwood: Nothing glamorous, man.\nDanny Brown: I mean, it tastes amazing! To have your brain go back to that, it tastes amazing. But once you get addicted to that taste, man, it's just a brain thing, it's like a mental thing, you're just stuck there. I haven't been drunk in a month, month-and-a-half, and not a day goes by that I don't taste it in my mouth.\nTim Westwood: Are you feeling it is taking a lot of effort and self-control and self-will and discipline ?\nDanny Brown: I think it's just helping me because I'm gone. If I was home, I'd be around people who drink.\nTim Westwood: So, the road is your rehab. But do you think that you could slip back in two years' time?\nDanny Brown: No, I don't even want to think like that, no. It's not something you can do soci- it's not something you can do recreationally. One sip, and you back. It's like smoking crack or something. It's nothing you can play around with, be like \"Let me taste your cup.\"\nTim Westwood: I used to smoke a spliff every day, smoke a spliff in the morning, and now I only smoke once a week.\nDanny Brown: Once you sip, you drink it, all day, every day. Like I say, man, it's  a liquid form of heroin with you. Everybody know what heroin do to people.\nTim Westwood: Well, I want to wish you good luck with that. You had some low moments. What were those moments like, feeling like?\nDanny Brown: I've been drinking that shit for the last two years. Anybody who's been dependent on something for that long, you'll have emotional issues. As long as I'm not at home, I'll be fine.\nTim Westwood: Now, you tweeted out during the low moments. Do you feel like that was a cry for help, saying you're going through a hard time?\nDanny Brown: No, that was just one of those things that I probably could've kept to myself. Twitter is a motherfucker sometimes. Sometimes your battery just needs to die. But you know, I'm the type of person that wears my heart on my sleeve. I don't live for nobody but me.\nTim Westwood: What I understand is that there was not enough people reaching out to you. Not fans, but other artists, there were no artists who were reaching out to you.\nDanny Brown: No, I was just in my feelings, you know? At the end of the day, it was just me getting off drugs and being emotional and being in my feelings. I was just feeling a type of way that day. I'm over it now. Everybody that I felt like I cared about, that I do care about, that cares about me, they reached out to me. They saw that shit, like, \"What the fuck are you talking about?\" I was just tripping, man.\nTim Westwood: Was the ASAP Mob there for you?\nDanny Brown: Rocky was actually trying to call me, but I didn't know it was his number, so I didn't pick up, so I missed out on Rocky.

Why's that?\nDanny Brown: I was getting too fat, man, I gained like fifteen pounds.\nTim Westwood: For real?\nDanny Brown: Yeah, I like wearing Balmain jeans and Rick Owens t-shirts. You can't wear Rick Owens looking pregnant, you know what I'm saying? You can't have the Gucci Mane belly, man, to wear high-end fashion, you know what I'm saying? So one of 'em had to go.\nTim Westwood: Yeah, yeah, and for real, I mean, Gucci brought that little fucking belly into fashion, uh, why he continued it, the -\nDanny Brown: You know, that look cool when you wear Coogi t-shirts and stuff, but once you start putting on -\nTim Westwood: Tight shit, then you look like a skinny little fat guy.\nDanny Brown: yes and it's the worst.\nTim Westwood: So why was syrup making you fat?\nDanny Brown: It's the sugar, you're drinking a lot of sugar. I might drink a 2-liter of soda a day by myself. That's just too much soda to be drinking a day.\nTim Westwood: Coming off the syrup, how long did you feel it took to get your mind off of it?\nDanny Brown: About two weeks. I mean your stomach is just real fucked up. That's what's so nasty about it, everyone's talking about sipping syrup but if you don't have syrup for three days your might shit on yourself.\nTim Westwood: Oh it's that bad?\nDanny Brown: You can't hold it. It's diarrhea. But then, this is the other side is if you drink too much, you become constipated and you can't take a shit. That's why Gucci Mane's belly was like that, it wasn't that he was fat it's that he was bloated. There was mad turds up in there.\nTim Westwood: He was backed up!\nDanny Brown: This is true though. So it's nasty, to all the kids who think drinking syrup is cool, don't get me wrong it tastes amazing and it might help you sleep at night, but all the other side effects, it's not worth it.\nTim Westwood: So the bloated stomach, putting on the weight, being backed up like a mother fucker-\nDanny Brown: And then if you don't have it, you gotta shit like crazy. You can't hold anything. You might as well get some Imodium A-D and keep them in your pocket like peppermints. Literally as soon as you start eating. You might not even have nothing in your stomach, just a couple drops of water. A lot of people listening think it's like a glamorous thing, it's not man!\nTim Westwood: I can't even imagine, if I were gonna come off the syrup I'd be scared to fart.\nDanny Brown: But that's why people continue to drink. And then you have some people that drink all the time and talk about it but you don't see the signs of that. So I think there's a lot of punks, I think there's a lot of studio sipping.\nTim Westwood: You think so?\nDanny Brown: They talk about but they ain't about it.\nTim Westwood: They ain't about it.\nDanny Brown: Yeah. They just promoting it. At the end of the day, yeah, it is for no reason.\nTim Westwood: With that, sleeping is good though?\nDanny Brown: Yeah and it was good for me to sleep, you're traveling to different time zones, you'd just be messed up, and then you have to go back out. So to go home and sleep for two days that would be great for me.\nTim Westwood: That's how crazy it is, you just sleep for hours?\nDanny Brown: Yeah I would probably sleep like ten hours. Just out, real deep sleep. You don't even know you sleep. That's the thing, that's why a lot of people die in they sleep because of some habit while you sleep. If something weird were to happen while you sleep and you can't take care of it.\nTim Westwood: And sometimes, man, you just shut down in your sleep, everything just shuts down.\nDanny Brown: Now I just take a Xanax, man.  drinking two-liters of soda, you know, shitting on myself everywhere. You trying to bring lean to Africa with you. Just 'cause you don't want to get sick.\nTim Westwood: So you have to travel with some lean?\nDanny Brown: All the time! Last time I was with you I was drinking lean, remember?\nTim Westwood: How do you travel with quantities of lean?\nDanny Brown: Because you can take three ounces of liquid on a plane. You know, you can buy those travel things, just put three ounces in there. It could be shampoo, they don't know what it is, and if they do find it, it's my cough syrup. I had a big bottle I had to break -\nTim Westwood: Just break it out-\nDanny Brown: And get through. But then you ain't out there drinking to be drinking, you out there to get your stomach right.\nTim Westwood: Maintain and self-medicate.\nDanny Brown: It's nasty, though. So, don't drink lean, kids, don't drink lean.\nTim Westwood: So, you think lean should go down the sink?\nDanny Brown: Yes. I don't think it should be a drug that's glorified. It's liquid heroin, it's an opiate.\nTim Westwood: Nothing glamorous, man.\nDanny Brown: I mean, it tastes amazing! To have your brain go back to that, it tastes amazing. But once you get addicted to that taste, man, it's just a brain thing, it's like a mental thing, you're just stuck there. I haven't been drunk in a month, month-and-a-half, and not a day goes by that I don't taste it in my mouth.\nTim Westwood: Are you feeling it is taking a lot of effort and self-control and self-will and discipline ?\nDanny Brown: I think it's just helping me because I'm gone. If I was home, I'd be around people who drink.\nTim Westwood: So, the road is your rehab. But do you think that you could slip back in two years' time?\nDanny Brown: No, I don't even want to think like that, no. It's not something you can do soci- it's not something you can do recreationally. One sip, and you back. It's like smoking crack or something. It's nothing you can play around with, be like \"Let me taste your cup.\"\nTim Westwood: I used to smoke a spliff every day, smoke a spliff in the morning, and now I only smoke once a week.\nDanny Brown: Once you sip, you drink it, all day, every day. Like I say, man, it's  a liquid form of heroin with you. Everybody know what heroin do to people.\nTim Westwood: Well, I want to wish you good luck with that. You had some low moments. What were those moments like, feeling like?\nDanny Brown: I've been drinking that shit for the last two years. Anybody who's been dependent on something for that long, you'll have emotional issues. As long as I'm not at home, I'll be fine.\nTim Westwood: Now, you tweeted out during the low moments. Do you feel like that was a cry for help, saying you're going through a hard time?\nDanny Brown: No, that was just one of those things that I probably could've kept to myself. Twitter is a motherfucker sometimes. Sometimes your battery just needs to die. But you know, I'm the type of person that wears my heart on my sleeve. I don't live for nobody but me.\nTim Westwood: What I understand is that there was not enough people reaching out to you. Not fans, but other artists, there were no artists who were reaching out to you.\nDanny Brown: No, I was just in my feelings, you know? At the end of the day, it was just me getting off drugs and being emotional and being in my feelings. I was just feeling a type of way that day. I'm over it now. Everybody that I felt like I cared about, that I do care about, that cares about me, they reached out to me. They saw that shit, like, \"What the fuck are you talking about?\" I was just tripping, man.\nTim Westwood: Was the ASAP Mob there for you?\nDanny Brown: Rocky was actually trying to call me, but I didn't know it was his number, so I didn't pick up, so I missed out on Rocky. Chase talked to me, though.\nTim Westwood: He's good people. So, I wish you the best of luck on your journey, man.\nDanny Brown: Thank you.

You smokin' on them clones, my nigga but\n**\"I stay on\" (sample)**\n(Verse 2: Danny Brown)\nI used to work at spots, make thirty off a hunnit'\nI was fucked up at the time like \"Run it\"\nSo what, I sold dope. That don't make me who I is\nPunked out a couple fights. That don't make me no bitch\nDepths of the D. Straight-up out the cage\nDanny Brown, motherfucker, out that Bruiser Brigade\nNigga on that no-look thunk shit\nThese Dunks don't match this fit, so unorthodox with it\nIf the bitches lookin' at me, cause they know I ain't basic\nA blonde bitch could see that, no Lasik\nPaint pictures. No need for the tracin'\n**\"I stay on\" (sample)**\nAnd I be in her walls. One time she almost fainted\nLived in a Slum Village, pussy a little tainted\nSo I strapped up before I went up in it\nI ain't try'na catch nothin', buggin' while I'm up in it\n(Chorus x 2)"}},

dreams\nYou can do a show a day, you can't afford these jeans\nNikes you ain't seen, you cop yours from the liquor store\nRed munks(?), 50 bucks, show you what a nigga know\nCop it on sight, while you shopping for deals\nLeaving Somerset while you go to Forman Mills\nShow up at the party, get the hoes hazed out\nNever rock Carti's 'cuz that shit played out\n(?) in the system, give me one listen\nHit the booth and bless it like a prostitute and Christian\n\nAhead of my time\nI stay on my grind\nI'm taking your shine\nThis city is mine\nYou know where I'm at\nDon't know how to act\nI'm

relax\nMy swagger to the max\n\nI said there's lead in the toys so your kids can't play\nGirls kissing on the tube tryna turn your daughter gay\nFree condoms in the class but you paying for your books\nThe system wants your ass, minorities overlooked\nYou copping on the block, want you to cop for a judge\nHit you with high numbers, say they tryna show you love\nThat's how they do us niggas, want us trapped behind bars\nSo we trapped in our home, rolling weed out of jars\nFeeling like Merv pop when he picked that heater up\n'Bout to kill the game like Marvin picking needles up\n(??????) got me riding all night, blowing purple in the Cutty got me riding all night\nHenny got me feeling right, she know she with the troop\nShe ain't gotta lie, when she shake she feeling loose\n(?) in the

you shopping for deals\nLeaving Somerset while you go to Forman Mills\nShow up at the party, get the hoes hazed out\nNever rock Carti's 'cuz that shit played out\n(?) in the system, give me one

books\nThe system wants your ass, minorities overlooked\nYou copping on the block, want you to cop for a judge\nHit you with high numbers, say they tryna show you love\nThat's how they do us niggas, want us trapped behind bars\nSo we trapped in our home, rolling weed out of jars\nFeeling like Merv pop when he picked that heater up\n'Bout to kill the game like Marvin picking needles up\n(??????) got me riding all night, blowing purple in the Cutty got me riding all night\nHenny got me feeling right, she know she with the troop\nShe ain't gotta lie, when she shake she feeling loose\n(?) in the system, give me one listen\nHit the booth and bless it like a prostitute and Christian\n\nAhead of my time\nI stay on my grind\nI'm taking your shine\nThis city is mine\nYou know where I'm at\nDon't

conies\nCause ain\u2019t shit in the crib man we lucky wit bologna\nLonely inside living in a quarter house\nBunch a niggas pressed like a church lady blouse\nWonder why all these niggas running to the south\nBut in these 60's niggas came to where?\nWonder why all these motherfuckers running to the south\nCause in the 60's our elders came from there\nYeah...\n\nI sit and drink some tea with grandma\nAnd talk about how much we isn't getting\nWe just pray, hope the blessings collect\nYesterday got a call from my cousin collect\nHe upstate, said he straight, niggas locked\nQuotin' bars from my mixtape\nBut I'm far from paid, and the bills don't fade\nSo if you don't play might be locked in the cage\nNah I play the stage, and the hour's never flexible\nBeen doing this since granny made me eat my vegetables\nThrew away my school schedule...\nThese niggas lack testicles...\nSay what they want, don't do what they feel\nSometimes I look at shit like is it really real?\nSame question Meth asked in '94\nHad the hilfiger bubble coat...\nCrushed on tiffany but she wasn't feeling me\nCause she was in the 12th grade sipping on hennessey\nNow she a memory of what she once was\nCause if you see her no you wouldn't touch her with a buzz\nThat's fucked up", "image": "https://images.genius.com/37ea9ff66ec03f66721aeba12118643d.300x300x1.jpg", "artist": "Danny Brown", "raw":

hope I catch him on another day\nBut I ain't trying to see him, in a fuckin' round with the gay\nOne look at my granny, I thought for sure sinking\nDamn... you know what I'm thinking\nNah.... I see you're kinda slow\nCause I ain't serving shit, but this flow\nAnd this beat is like a pack, flow like crack\nI'mma do 'em one better, flip this sect\nSo these bars is fat nickels, got my first sale\nBought the kids popsicles, the game's so fickle\nGot me going and my lawyer fair to cop swishers\nNarcs pull us over, talking 'bout where's the pistols\nAnd all we tryna do is just get a couple conies\nCause ain\u2019t shit in the crib man we lucky wit bologna\nLonely inside living in a quarter house\nBunch a niggas pressed like a church lady blouse\nWonder why all these niggas running to the south\nBut in these 60's niggas came to where?\nWonder why all these motherfuckers running to the south\nCause in the 60's our elders came from there\nYeah...\n\nI sit and drink some tea with grandma\nAnd talk about how much we isn't getting\nWe just pray, hope the blessings collect\nYesterday got a call from my cousin collect\nHe upstate, said he straight, niggas locked\nQuotin' bars from my mixtape\nBut I'm far from paid, and the bills don't fade\nSo if you don't play might be locked in the cage\nNah I play the stage, and the hour's never flexible\nBeen doing this since granny made me eat my vegetables\nThrew away my school schedule...\nThese niggas lack testicles...\nSay what they want, don't do what they feel\nSometimes I look at shit like is it really real?\nSame question Meth asked in '94\nHad the hilfiger bubble coat...\nCrushed on tiffany but she wasn't feeling me\nCause she was in the 12th grade sipping on hennessey\nNow she a memory of what she once was\nCause if you see her no you wouldn't touch her with a buzz\nThat's fucked up"}}, {"title": "Tell Me What I Don't Know", "album": "Atrocity Exhibition", "year": "2016-09-21", "lyrics": "Street smart, Ph.D\nDropped out for a slanging degree\n9 on me, keep the devils off me\n'Cause we was living in hell, couldn't afford property\nLil nigga gettin' frontin' from OGs\nOz of reggie bagged up in the Pelle\nIn a school hallways on a burnout celly\nLeaving out of class early, caught a sale for 20\nHow long will it last?\nNever ending race, chasin' cash\nOne lane going wrong way 'til I crash\nTeacher find my sack, going nowhere fast\n\nTell me what I don't know\nLast night homie got killed at the liquor store\nShot my nigga on the way to get a Swisher\nBreaking down the weed when the call got received\n\nWe was so ambitious\nAll we really wanted was new Jordans and some bitches\nFlashing bankrolls in the club taking pictures\nThinking we was grown men, really lil' niggas\nJumping dope fiends that's owing us for credit\nTaking turns catching sales things copacetic\nSlice your tomato if you owe us for the lettuce\nRunning through the sack of D sorta like Jerome Bettis\nNaive to the outcome\nCuz hit the block, hit the stash and they found some\nLock us all up for a bag and some pistols\nNow we in the county writing letters I miss you\n\nTell me what I don't know\nHook raid came through kickin' down the front door\nNow we facin' judge, got us sitting at the court\nGave us all probation now we smokin' Newports\nTell me what I don't know\nHook raid came through kickin' down the

what I don't know\n\nAnd we was so gung ho\nWet a nigga up like he forgot his poncho\nOn the block all day chasin' that cilantro\nHook raid kickin' on the front door\nShit is like a cycle\nYou get out, I go in, this is not the life for us\nShit is like a cycle\nYou get out, I go in, this is not the life for us\n\nTell me what I don't know\nLast night homie got killed at the liquor store\nShot

going wrong way 'til I crash\nTeacher find my sack, going nowhere fast\n\nTell me what I don't know\nLast night homie got killed at the liquor store\nShot my nigga on the way to get a Swisher\nBreaking down the weed when the call got received\n\nWe was so ambitious\nAll we really wanted was new Jordans and some bitches\nFlashing bankrolls in the club taking pictures\nThinking we was grown men, really lil' niggas\nJumping dope fiends that's owing us for credit\nTaking turns catching sales things copacetic\nSlice your tomato if you owe us for the lettuce\nRunning through the sack of D sorta like Jerome Bettis\nNaive to the outcome\nCuz hit the block, hit the stash and they found some\nLock us all up for a bag and some pistols\nNow we in the county writing letters I miss you\n\nTell me what I don't know\nHook raid came through kickin' down the front door\nNow we facin' judge, got us sitting at the court\nGave us all probation now we smokin' Newports\nTell me what I don't know\nHook raid came through kickin' down the front door\nNow we facin' judge, got us sitting at the court\nGave us all probation now we smokin' Newports\nTell me what I don't know\nTell me what I don't know\nTell me what I don't know\nTell me what I don't know\n\nAnd we was so gung ho\nWet a nigga up like he forgot his poncho\nOn the block all day chasin' that cilantro\nHook raid kickin' on the front door\nShit is like a cycle\nYou get out, I go in, this is not the life for us\nShit is like a cycle\nYou get out, I go in, this is not the life for us\n\nTell me what I don't know\nLast night homie got killed at the liquor store\nShot my nigga on the way to get a Swisher\nBreaking down the weed when the call got received\nTell me what I don't know\nHook raid came through kickin' down

the broth\nYeah, pour another glass of pop y'all\nAnd thank God for a Bridge Card\n\nLet's bow our heads, hold hands, and thank God\nLet's hit the market my baby and go hard\nLet's hit Save a Lot and we can buy it all\nThank God for a Bridge Card, hey!\n\nThey say the hood starving, but we be eating\nFrying wing dings with the fake Lawry seasoning\nYeah, Larry's, but it's still good though\nJust

nigga\nDone rose out them ashes, drinking Fiji water\nWanna pull me in that fire while I'm tryna feed my daughter\nWanna snatch my momma's plate, and tell her she can't eat\nAnd we gone have us some discrepancies right here in this skreet\nBecause the weak don't speak, get left in silence\nAnd when you don't listen, gotta speak with violence\nAnd duct tape the grandmomma, strip a man of all his honor\nTryna be a G, now you wish you a goner\nI walk with the Gods with a tongue for the devil\nTryna keep a nigga thirsty so for rain, I pray mercy\n\nThe return of the gangster cause niggas don't believe\nI roll hotter than my sleeve, leave a nigga in the street\nThe return of the gangster cause niggas got bills\nThis rap shit don't work then its back to selling krills\nReturn of the gangster cause niggas want that real\nWant that old Danny Brown but nigga I'm like chill\nThe return of the gangster fuck a hipster squeeze a trigger\nYou got me fucked up, I'm a hood-ass nigga\n\nUh\nGibbs\nES to GN\nEastside niggas keep roaches in the ashtray\nTwenty thousand out the public housing on a bad day\nDrop it in the pot, if it ain't locking that's some bad yay\nTryna save

pull me over\nThis shit get realer than shit that's on your PlayStation controller\nCall of Duty ass nigga, dick in the booty ass nigga\nDon't po' up roll no dough up and I don't get no cash with

thanks ta'\nThese phony ass wannabe thug perpetrators and wankstas\nYour white tee turn to tie-dye, nigga I red paint ya\nWon't stress or cry about it, cause it's not in my nature\nIt's the return of

lying saying I pass\nYesterday's clothes, yellow teeth when I cheese\nNothing on the weed but let me hit them trees\nAnd do you got another square? See my pockets is bare\nYou look in my face all you see is despair\nAnd a newport will take the load off for a minute\nFuck the radio, don't watch TV it's all gimmicks\nMom got welfare, still hard, got a job\nTurn around and lock her up for welfare fraud\nSister had a third abortion, got six kids\nWhat's crazy, she only twenty-six\nMy brother lost his daughter, she was only four months\nSo what the fuck I'm 'posed to do but sit and smoke blunts\n x2\n\nDanny Brown, hot nigga, raise the window\nSelling rocks since the days of Nintendo\nLock them ? reaking like endo\nCheese sandwiches sipping on cool shots\nUsing my timberland for a pillow\nNeck throbbing, feel like I slept on an armadillo\nTaste like steak, it was only a pack of skittles\nBut that was then, now I'm back on the block\nFitted cock like Curtis in a comet\nWhite powder, motherfucker it ain't common\nSo strong, make the hardest fiend vomit\nDanny Brown is the future, I promise\nUsed to wear shoe strings for

hook come around\nThem kids come down\nThey a tell on you\nIt\u2019s snakes in the grass\nGetting trapped by rodents\nPotent we smoking\nA leave you choking\nHoping you focused\nSo dog take notice\nFor a flash of light\nRun you off light roaches\nHopping off porches\nWith chrome 44\nNose long as song\nMade by Mike Bolton\nLightning bolts\nRip through your torso\nRaining blood\nAfter that thunder\nMommas crying\nChildren wonder\nBut this is the life\nThat we all succumbed to\nMake a nigga wanna go\nAnd cut his phone off\nCops killing niggas everyday\nLike protocol\nWatch the TV\nTurn on the news\nMake a nigga feel like\nHe listened to blues\nIn the hood\nWit that Arm & Hammer\nGetting them Pampers\nFor baby mama\nHood flick us\nWe in the slammer\nNow ya baby raised\nBy another man bruh\nCure for cancer\nCure for A.I.D.S\nMake a nigga\nWanna stay on tour for days\nEverywhere you go\nGotta keep that tool\nCause you don\u2019t want end up\nHappening to you\nSo everywhere u go\nGotta keep that tool\nCause you don\u2019t want it end up\nHappening to you\n\nToday today today\nI say you never never never know\nWhen ya time to go\nI say you never never never know\nWhen ya

little bit of crumbs\nWhen you trapped in the slums\nThey a pop you nigga\nWatch where you go\nWatch where you at\nCause goons on attack\nAnd that\u2019s a fact\nYou don't want it like that\nNiggas get bodied like everyday\nNigga masked up like masquerade\nBruiser Brigade\nNigga take this fade\nOr get marked out\nLike crossword game\nFor a little name\nNigga pop yo chain\nPlaying no games\nEvict arcade\nTrade in your life\nFor a pair of new J's\nA-OK with them AK\u2019s\nBroad daylight\nMake you do a relay\nDuck behind cars\nWhen you hear the tool spray\nYou don\u2019t want beef\nGet simmer souffl\u00e9\nSitting in the Bimmer\nWith ya lightskin bae\nFuck all the tough shit\nI\u2019m tryna get paid\nYou ain't bout money\nNigga you the same way\nEnd of the day\nNigga jail the new

summertime breeze\nBut in reality I just blow my breath\nLet the Michigan cold numb my flesh\nI need a tissue cus my nose is runnin'\nFaced harsh winters, locked hot summer\nFuck the president and the next running\nNone of them niggas gon' let me hold something\nTake one step forward and two steps back\nNobody gets nowhere like that\nI take one step forward and two steps back\nNobody gets through life like that\nI take one step forward and two steps back\nNobody gets through life like that\nTake one step forward and two steps back\nNobody gets nowhere like that\nAt night I lay in bed and just pray I can sleep\nThink about my life with the TV on the blink\nStarin' at the ceiling, I just think\nShould I write my own will but I ran outta ink\nAsk God questions almost every day\nI almost get my answers a damn year later\nI rolled in (...) (...)\nSpit for crack babies\nLayin' incubators\nThis is for my niggas workin' nine to five\nThey wanna beat they boss ass but they gotta survive\nFor the ones who hustle, had to slow up\nCause they wanna be around and see they kids grow up\nMy boy got a chain for his thirteenth birthday\nWent to school, niggas jumped him the next day\nTruthfully, they took his honesty\nCause now my nigga locked up for two armed robberies\nOne step forward and two steps back\nNobody gets through life like that\nI take one step forward and two steps back\nNobody gets nowhere like that\nI take one step forward and two steps back\nNobody gets through life like that\nI take one step forward and two steps back\nNobody gets nowhere like that\nYeah-yuh\nThat's how it is sometimes you know\nShout out to all my

movie tomorrow\nMama always said there'd be days like this\nAin't got my own pot so in the alley I piss\nI'll risk my own life to be rich\nWorkin' like a slave for them chains and whips\nI daydream around palm trees\nBlowin' haze in the day summertime breeze\nBut in reality I just blow my breath\nLet the Michigan cold numb my flesh\nI need a tissue cus my nose is runnin'\nFaced harsh winters, locked hot summer\nFuck the president and the next running\nNone of them niggas gon' let me hold something\nTake one step forward and two steps back\nNobody gets nowhere like that\nI take one step forward and two steps back\nNobody gets through life like that\nI take one step forward and two steps back\nNobody gets through life like that\nTake one step forward and two steps back\nNobody gets nowhere like that\nAt night I lay in bed and just pray I can sleep\nThink about my life with the TV on the blink\nStarin' at the ceiling, I just think\nShould I write my own will but I ran outta ink\nAsk God questions almost every day\nI almost get my answers a damn year later\nI rolled in (...) (...)\nSpit for crack babies\nLayin' incubators\nThis is for my niggas workin' nine to five\nThey wanna beat they boss ass but they gotta survive\nFor the ones who hustle, had to slow up\nCause they wanna be around and see they kids grow up\nMy boy got a chain for his thirteenth birthday\nWent to school, niggas jumped him the next day\nTruthfully, they took his honesty\nCause now my nigga locked up for two armed robberies\nOne step forward and two steps back\nNobody gets through life like that\nI take one step forward and two steps back\nNobody gets nowhere like that\nI take one step forward and two steps back\nNobody gets through life like that\nI take one step forward and two steps back\nNobody gets nowhere like that\nYeah-yuh\nThat's how it is sometimes you know\nShout out to all my niggas with they dreams though man\nDon't give up\nYou gotta keep movin' man\nAll my Detroit niggas, we fucked up\nWe gon' make it outta this shit man..."}}, {"title": "Way It Goes", "album": "Detroit

talk with Ebonics and I never graduated\nSo I'm a lost cause, gun in my drawers\nLive another day, seem I got to break the law\nSay this another way to put food on my plate\nMy daughter still hungry at the minimum wage\nSo you take away my days, put me in a cell\nPray every night, think I should burn in hell?\nLie to me as a kid, say I had a future\nBut I learned the truth when my mama rent was due\nSaid you was being honest, gave me a false promise\nSo I depend on nothing but this bottle and some chronic\nTold me that if I change, I might just see dollars\nBut instead I got change and all it was, was copper\n\nWhen does it end, God, I don't really know\nMight be the state pen' or getting buried in a hole\nBut that's just the way it go\nThat's just the way it go\nThat's just the way it go\nThat's just the way it go\n\nEven died in a dream\nNo niggas doing life, some ain't make 18\nYoung whores in the hood take lies before they start\nRobbed of self-esteem, now, they ain't got a heart\nStaring in the mirror, hearing voices in my head\nSaying: \"Take advantage cause you're 'posed to been dead\"\nStaying on a mission for the nickels and the dimes\nBlowing on chronic while I'm peeking out the blinds\nSign of the time, ain't no respect\nCan't leave the house if I ain't got the Tec\nAt night, I can't sleep, like a Vietnam vet\nCan't trust my own blood, everybody is a

fuck is you\nShow her some green and the ho turn blue\nIgnorant as fuck but I'm smarter than you\nSixes on the chevy, hustle harder than you\nSo immature but the rims so grown\nCatch me in the club whilin' off the Patron\n40 on me dog I don't never get searched\nIf a nigga trip then he might get murked\nBetter swallow your pride\nStomp a nigga at the bar, fuck going outside\n\nWhat up doe dog I'm straight\nBeen gettin' money since 1998\nI'm in the Chevy with a temporary plate\nSittin' on them sixes but I want 28's\nWhattup doe dog I'm cool\nYou keep trippin' I'mma act a fuckin' fool\nYou keep talking I'mma pull that two\nAnd show you how Detroit niggas do\n\nBrown cuttin' up white like BoRics\nNiggas wanna hustle but don't really know shit\nSmoke green like I shot a Ninja Turtle\nMatta fact popped Prince, way I smoke Purple\nMy basement sorta like Urkel\nTake a half track bring back a whole circle\nHook flipped the nigga had me gone til November\nCause the way I mix like my wrist was a blender\nMore snow than December\nNiggas rhymes soft like they notebook tender\nCold like Winter sippin' slushee in a igloo\nDetroit nigga movin' work on a Mongoose\nAll retag regal\nDrivin' no license like that shit legal\nFuck bitches like AIDS don't exist\nI'm a young Ruthless nigga on some Eazy-E shit"}}, {"title": "When It Rain", "album": "Atrocity Exhibition", "year":

hard when I'm on them 'ralls\nBitch so freaky, suck a dick through the drawers\nHalls in her mouth just to hum on the balls\nAfter this night whore I won't even call\nUp so high, I ain't never gone fall\nPissing on niggas got careers in the stall\nShitting on niggas, leaving streaks in your drawers\nTake your top off like a toilet when it's clogged\n\nThey say I'm a menace, I meant it, I meant

porch\nWith a pipe in his hand, in the other, a torch\nI kept on moving, ain't worried 'bout that\n'Bout a block later heard rat-tat-tat-tat\nNext, some niggas from over there shooting\nDog I ain't blinked just kept it a-moving\nBlock later up, what do I find?\nA junkie ho, at left and right, crime\nFlagging up cars, getting her bread\nAnd that's what I seen on the way to get bread\n\nOn my way

me\nLooking at me like I'm 'bout to steal\nBut really though dawg, you need to go chill\nGrabbed what I needed, left out the do'\nTwo little boys in front of the sto'\nFiends running up, running through alleys\nI kept on moving, nobody looked at me\nCourse some niggas stomped on my head\nAll because they wanted the bread\n\nOn my way to get Wonderbread\nI swear I just want the bread\nOn my

slots\nWant you to snitch so they can hit the jackpot\nRappers make it sound good \nBut they don't tell you bout the rock with the \nThe real Rick Ross sold work for the feds\nUsed to get fronted work, my man wanted his bread\nBack in 2000 and niggas still poor\nMatter fact crack ain't even poppin' no more\nNow your best bet is fucking with the trees\nDon't slang for what you want, slang for what you need\nA-Town niggas talking bout they flipping keys\nDetroit run Atlanta nigga ask Big Meech\n\nNiggas in my city always talking bout the bag\nNever sold crack, just the crack of their ass\nFlip more stones than a fucking archaeologist\nSmart like scholarships to two colleges\nSkipped class had to quench my thirst\nNow i'm jumping fiends who ain't pay me on the first\nRocks in my socks, jeans \nRemember having dreams I ain't never coming home\nLost in the streets can't find my way\nHit \nGetting paid while my ho's kiss J's\nNiggas in the streets know Brown don't

bruiser, off that Don Shula\nHave you running through your hood like Ferris Bueller\nMake no mistake, I'm an ace when I face that bass\nReally burnt when I'm on that snare\nOK, oh yeah\nI'mma go Randy Savage\nWhile your mother kid play cabbage\nAin't no way you see me saut\u00e9\nAnd it's Motown lineup when I pull it on the pay\nErase or obey, we're starting to get a toothache\n16s so sweet, gotta check for the Adam's apple\nDog, I'm on another chapter, different book\nRead most of these rappers, they just care about they look\nAnd they so like Zoolander, who guessed\nHoes stay clicking like a backup dancer\nHomie, what's the answer?\nEverything you do is in question\nDoing anything for attention\nWait, did I mention\nGimmick might get you recognition?\nYou'll never be competition\nWait, did I mention\nGimmick might get you recognition?\nBut you'll never be competition, for real\n\nIs it really worth it for fast cars and ice?\nDo you wanna live that life?\nIs it really worth it? New girls every night\nDo you wanna live that life?\nIs it really worth it?\nIs it really worth it?\n\nMachete in a haystack\nAround these needles putting poison in your veins\nWhat they be speaking putting poison in your brain\nSwear to God, got me tripping, thinking on a different plane\nFlow with a cosmo, popper stopper apostle\nKinda like I lasso hostile profile\nYou don't wanna get jacked so\nGet hit up with that rocko\nBall so hard, when you land, leave a pothole\nEver since a snot-nose I've been about dough\nStaring out the window, dreaming of a studio\nWriting in my notepad, honing my craft\nBase one on a full track, play it back, hell is that?\nRepresenting me on mash\n\nIs it really worth it for fast cars and ice?\nDo you wanna live that life?\nIs it really worth it? New girls every night\nDo you wanna live that life?\nIs it really worth it?\nIs it really worth it?\n\n(Who do you think you are, a big shot?)
