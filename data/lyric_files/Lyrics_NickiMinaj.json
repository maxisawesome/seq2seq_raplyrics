I collect paintings of Marilyn Monroe\n19. I've always loved acting\n20. My first movie, \"The Other Woman\" comes out next year\n21. I just may have a song on the soundtrack\n22.

"The Pinkprint", "year": "2014-12-03", "lyrics": "Yo, I had to reinvent, I put the V in-vent\nI put the heat in vents, man, I've been competing since\nI look beyond what people saying, and I see intent\nThen I just sit back and decipher what they really meant\nCherish these nights, cherish these people\nLife is a movie, but there'll never be a sequel\nAnd I'm good with that as long as I'm peaceful\nAs long as seven years from now I'm taking my daughter to preschool\nCherish these days, man, do they go quick\nJust yesterday, I swear it was 'o-six\nTen years ago, that's when you proposed\nI looked down, \"Yes, I suppose\"\n\nAll things go, all things go\nAll things go, all things go\nI feel one minute, yeah, we got it then it's gone\nWhile we keep waiting for a moment to live for\nSo can't nobody ever tell me that I'm wrong\nCause I'ma ride out with you, still the night is young\nAnd we keep going, we go\n(We go, we go) We wake back up and do it all again\n(We know, we know) Say fuck the world, we riding 'til the end\nWhen all is said and done, look what we've become\nI just want you to know that I did it for you\n\nI lost my little cousin, to a senseless act of violence\nHis sister said he wanted to stay with me, but I didn't invite him\nWhy didn't he ask, or am I just buggin'?\nCause since I got fame, they don't act the same even though they know that I love 'em\nFamily ties, broken before me\nNiggas trying to kill him, he ain't even call me\nAnd that's the reflection of me, yes, I get it, I get it was all me\nI pop a pill and remember the look in his eyes, the last day he saw me\n\nAll things go, all things go\nAll things go, all things go\nI feel one minute, yeah, we got it then it's gone\nWhile we keep waiting for a moment to live for\nSo can't nobody ever tell me that I'm wrong\nCause I'ma ride out with you, still the night is young\nAnd we keep going, we go\n(We go, we go) We wake back up and do it all again\n(We know, we know) Say fuck the world, we riding 'til the end\nWhen all is said and done, look what we've become\nI just want you to know that I did it for you\n\nLet me make this clear, I'm not difficult, I'm just 'bout my business\nI'm not into fake industry parties, and fake agendas\nRock with people for how they make me feel, not what they give me\nEven the ones that hurt me the most, I still show forgiveness\nI love my mother more than life itself and that's a fact\nI'd give it all if somehow I could just rekindle that\nShe never understands why I'm so overprotective\nThe more I work, the more I feel like somehow they're neglected\nI want 'Caiah to go to college, just to say \"We did it!\"\nMy child with Aaron, would've have been sixteen any minute\nSo in some ways I feel like 'Caiah is the both of them\nIt's like he's 'Caiah's little angel, looking over him\nAnd I know Jelani will always love me, and I'll always love him\nAnd I'm just his little sister, not Nicki Minaj when I'm around him\nGee, we did it, let's leave this imprint\nJust finished writing, this is The Pinkprint\n\nAll things go, all things go\nAll things go, all things go\nI feel one minute, yeah, we got it then it's gone\nWhile we keep waiting for a moment to live for\nSo can't nobody ever tell me that I'm wrong\nCause I'ma ride out with you, still the night is young\nAnd we keep going, we go\n(We go, we go) We wake back up and do it all again\n(We know, we know) Say fuck the world, we riding 'til the end\nWhen all is said and done, look what we've become\nI just want you to know that I did it for you\nAll things go, all things

I've been competing since\nI look beyond what people saying, and I see intent\nThen I just sit back and decipher what they really meant\nCherish these nights, cherish these people\nLife is a movie, but there'll never be a sequel\nAnd I'm good with that as long as I'm peaceful\nAs long as seven years from now I'm taking my daughter to preschool\nCherish these days, man, do they go quick\nJust yesterday, I swear it was 'o-six\nTen years ago, that's when you proposed\nI looked down, \"Yes, I suppose\"\n\nAll things go, all things go\nAll things go, all things go\nI feel one minute, yeah, we got it then it's gone\nWhile we keep waiting for a moment to live for\nSo can't nobody ever tell me that I'm wrong\nCause I'ma ride out with you, still the night is young\nAnd we keep going, we go\n(We go, we go) We wake back up and do it all again\n(We know, we know) Say fuck the world, we riding 'til the end\nWhen all is said and done, look what we've become\nI just want you to know that I did it for you\n\nI lost my little cousin, to a senseless act of violence\nHis sister said he wanted to stay with me, but I didn't invite him\nWhy didn't he ask, or am I just buggin'?\nCause since I got fame, they don't act the same even though they know that I love 'em\nFamily ties, broken before me\nNiggas trying to kill him, he ain't even call me\nAnd that's the reflection of me, yes, I get it, I get it was all me\nI pop a pill and remember the look in his eyes, the last day he saw me\n\nAll things go, all things go\nAll things go, all things go\nI feel one minute, yeah, we got it then it's gone\nWhile we keep waiting for a moment to live for\nSo can't nobody ever tell me that I'm wrong\nCause I'ma ride out with you, still the night is young\nAnd we keep going, we go\n(We go, we go) We wake back up and do it all again\n(We know, we know) Say fuck the world, we riding 'til the end\nWhen all is said and done, look what we've become\nI just want you to know that I did it for you\n\nLet me make this clear, I'm not difficult, I'm just 'bout my business\nI'm not into fake industry parties, and fake agendas\nRock with people for how they make me feel, not what they give me\nEven the ones that hurt me the most, I still show forgiveness\nI love my mother more than life itself and that's a fact\nI'd give it all if somehow I could just rekindle that\nShe never understands why I'm so overprotective\nThe more I work, the more I feel like somehow they're neglected\nI want 'Caiah to go to college, just to say \"We did it!\"\nMy child with Aaron, would've have been sixteen any minute\nSo in some ways I feel like 'Caiah is the both of them\nIt's like he's 'Caiah's little angel, looking over him\nAnd I know Jelani will always love me, and I'll always love him\nAnd I'm just his little sister, not Nicki Minaj when I'm around him\nGee, we did it, let's leave this imprint\nJust finished writing, this is The Pinkprint\n\nAll things go, all things go\nAll things go, all things go\nI feel one minute, yeah, we got it then it's gone\nWhile we keep waiting for a moment to live for\nSo can't nobody ever tell me that I'm wrong\nCause I'ma ride out with you, still the night is young\nAnd we keep going, we go\n(We go, we go) We wake back up and do it all again\n(We know, we know) Say fuck the world, we riding 'til the end\nWhen all is said and done, look what we've become\nI just want you to know that I did it for you\nAll things go, all things go\nAll things go, all things go"}}, {"title": "American Idol Fight", "album": null, "year": null, "lyrics":

The pain is infinite\nShe's my Queen and I ain't even British, she's the only reason, that I went to school and I finished (yeah)\nShe told me that I had talent, got on her knees and prayed for me when I started being violent (okay)\nShe saw something in me that 'til this day I don't know if I could be that (yeah)\nBut I'ma die tryin' and when I'm done cryin' grab the iron and black out like I'm retiring (kyuh)\nNightmares of you killing my mother, the reason that I sleep with my head under the covers\nAnd they should've thrown a book at you 'cause I hate you so much that it burn when I look at you\n\nMay the lord protect me, as the world gets hectic (I'll keep trying)\nMy voice projected, my life reflected (keep, keeping on)\nMay the lord protect me, as the world gets hectic\nMy voice projected, my life reflected (the more I cry, the more I try)\n\nDamn, I wanna run to you, hold you and kiss you and tell you how I miss you (I miss you baby)\nThought I would have a son for you but now it's official, it's over and I can't let you go (oh)\nBut I gotta let you know, all the shit I did made me feel like, I'm dying real slow\nCause no one understands me, they don't know what to do when I'm hurt and when I'm angry (kyuh)\nYou was my friend and my man and my daddy, you was there when that bitch tried to stab me\nAnything I ever needed, knew you had me, 'cause of you, all them chicks couldn't stand me\nSo why I hurt you? That's the question, it took this long, for me to learn my lesson\nCause now all I want is peace and get drama, finally understand the true meaning of karma\n\nMay the lord protect me, as the world gets hectic (I'll keep trying)\nMy voice projected, my life reflected (keep, keeping on)\nMay the lord protect me, as the world gets hectic\nMy voice projected, my life reflected (the more I cry, the more I try)\n\nPlease baby, forgive me, mommy was young, mommy was too busy tryna have fun\nNow, I don't pat myself on the back for sending you back 'cause God knows I was better than that (kyuh)\nTo conceive you, then leave you, the concept alone seems evil, I'm trapped in my conscience\nI adhered to the nonsense, listened to people who told me I wasn't ready for you\nBut how the \u2013 would they know what I was ready to do? And of course it wasn't your fault (no)\nIt's like I feel you the air, I hear you saying \"Mommy don't cry, can't you see I'm right here?\" (yes)\nI gotta let you know what you mean to me, when I'm sleeping, I see you in my dreams with me\nWish I could touch your little face, or just hold your little hand, if it's part of God's plan maybe we can meet again\n\n(The more I cry, the more I try, gotta keep on)\nMy voice projected, my life reflected\n(The more I cry, the more I try, gotta keep on)\n(The more I cry, the more I try, gotta keep on)\nMy voice projected, my life reflected\n(The

world gets hectic\nMy voice projected, my life reflected (the more I cry, the more I try)\n(Can you hear me, yeah)\n\nDaddy was a crack fiend, two in the morning, had us running down the block like a track team\nWhen you burnt the house down and my mother was in it, how could I forget it? The pain is infinite\nShe's my Queen and I ain't even British, she's the only reason, that I went to school and I finished (yeah)\nShe told me that I had talent, got on her knees and prayed for me when I started being violent (okay)\nShe saw something in me that 'til this day I don't know if I could be that (yeah)\nBut I'ma die tryin' and when I'm done cryin' grab the iron and black out like I'm retiring (kyuh)\nNightmares of you killing my mother, the reason that I sleep with my head under the covers\nAnd they should've thrown a book at you 'cause I hate you so much that it burn when I look at you\n\nMay the lord protect me, as the world gets hectic (I'll keep trying)\nMy voice projected, my life reflected (keep, keeping on)\nMay the lord protect me, as the world gets hectic\nMy voice projected, my life reflected (the more I cry, the more I try)\n\nDamn, I wanna run to you, hold you and kiss you and tell you how I miss you (I miss you baby)\nThought I would have a son for you but now it's official, it's over and I can't let you go (oh)\nBut I gotta let you know, all the shit I did made me feel like, I'm dying real slow\nCause no one understands me, they don't know what to do when I'm hurt and when I'm angry (kyuh)\nYou was my friend and my man and my daddy, you was there when that bitch tried to stab me\nAnything I ever needed, knew you had me, 'cause of you, all them chicks couldn't stand me\nSo why I hurt you? That's the question, it took this long, for me to learn my lesson\nCause now all I want is peace and get drama, finally understand the true meaning of karma\n\nMay the lord protect me, as the world gets hectic (I'll keep trying)\nMy voice projected, my life reflected (keep, keeping on)\nMay the lord protect me, as the world gets hectic\nMy voice projected, my life reflected (the more I cry, the more I try)\n\nPlease baby, forgive me, mommy was young, mommy was too busy tryna have fun\nNow, I don't pat myself on the back for sending you back 'cause God knows I was better than that (kyuh)\nTo conceive you, then leave you, the concept alone seems evil, I'm trapped in my conscience\nI adhered to the nonsense, listened to people who told me I wasn't ready for you\nBut how the \u2013 would they know what I was ready to do? And of course it wasn't your fault (no)\nIt's like I feel you the air, I hear you saying \"Mommy don't cry, can't you see I'm right here?\" (yes)\nI gotta let you know what you mean to me, when I'm sleeping, I see you in my dreams with me\nWish I could touch your little face, or just hold your little hand, if it's part of God's plan maybe we can meet again\n\n(The more I cry, the more I try, gotta keep on)\nMy voice projected, my life reflected\n(The more I cry, the more I try, gotta keep on)\n(The more I cry, the more I try, gotta keep on)\nMy voice projected, my life reflected\n(The more I cry, the more I try, gotta keep on)\nMay the lord protect me, as the world gets hectic\n(More, more, more, more, more, gotta keep \u2013 mo-o-o-o)\n(The more I cry, the more I try, gotta keep on)\nMay the lord protect me, as the world gets hectic\n(The more I cry, the more I try, gotta keep on)\n(The more I cry, the more I try, gotta keep on)\n\nMay the lord protect me, as the world gets hectic\nMy voice projected, my life reflected\nMay the lord protect me, as the world gets hectic\nMy voice projected, my life reflected\nMay the lord protect me, as the world gets hectic\nMy voice

personality bitch\nLike, you know, I'm, I'm, you know, I'm a ninja, I'm a boss\nI'm, I'm the Harajuku Barbie!\n\nWho say they wanna hackle me body\nThem haffa have a permit and a licence for me\nNow tell me who say them wanna hackle me body\nThem haffa have a permit and a licence for me\nAdmit it me say me moan and groan\nAdmit it, say me moan and groan\nAdmit it, say me moan and groan\nAdmit it, -mit it, -mit it, -mit it\n\nI just heard that I was the baddest in the town\nSo I came down and had to pick up my crown\nWent to Taiwan and had to pick up my wand\nNow everybody wanna pick up my sound\nBaddest underground since Harriet Tub\nThat's why when I come around they hurry and run\nAnd I know it ain't math but I carry the one\nGot a couple body guards that'll carry the guns\nYao Ming, I'mma need a couple Asians\nSayonara, bitches, on a Kawasaki blazin'\nAyo, Rihanna, gotta come up off dem bajans\nCall wyclef I'm a need a couple Haitians\nNow where my West Indies?\nWhere the fuck my curry chicken and my rice and peas?\nMy madda cunt Trinis\nMy Jamaican bod gal, all my Guyanese?\n\n\nI just found out that I was doper than Amy\nWinehouse, maybe\nFresh out the navy\nFresher then a daisy\nUsed to be on Baisley\nYoung money bunny bitch please say the baby\nPlease stop callin' me, I'm such a rock star\nAssalam alaikum, where the fuck is Akbar?\nGive 'em my keys, tell 'em valet my car\nB's pon da wheels, you can see them from far\nNow all I need is a real mandingo\nGimme good uhh and distribute my single\nBootleg the mixtape out in Nigeria\nHit up Amadu, he can meet the criteria\nIf he work da middle like a mohawk, tell'em he can meet me where dem girls say aloha\nSee I got da first class pussy and he use to give me Coacha\nReal good chocha, fuck is my chauffeur?\n\n\nAhh, beam me up, Scotty\nMy wa-wa wine\nMy wine is too dutty\nBeam me up scotty\nMy wa-ba wine\nMy wine is too dutty\n\nOne, two, buckle my shoe\nNo one on the corner has swagger like I do\nKeep a two-two, get wetter then boo-hoo\nKeep a couple stacks inside of my loo-loo\nExcuse me, I'm sorry\nI got the 45 special, don't worry\nCause I'm cooler than a bloodclaat flurry\nI like mi chicken and mi goat with curry(yeah)\nNow, where my West Indies?\nWhere the fuck my curry chicken and my rice and peas?\nMy madda cunt Trinis\nMy Jamaican bad gal, all my Guyanese?"}}, {"title":

career and don't take ransom\nDon't let me come out of my dungeon\nWhen mi did ah leave then take it down\nTrue say mi come out of England and it done\nTrue say the pattern come from Kingston\nTrinidad Trinidad, my island\n\nI see you in here dancing\nYour preview is quite romantic\nI envy your perfect kind of life\nWho knew you'd be so sexy?\nI think you're quite fantastic\nScrew your flaws, you're perfect in my eyes\n\nAnd maybe I'm naive for loving you\nYou're a cheating liar\nBut tonight you're everything I desire\n\nYou beautiful sinner\nI love your wicked heart\nBeautiful sinner\nIt's such a work of art\nI didn't know that bad could look so good\nYou are the type of bad that feels so good\nYou beautiful sinner\n\nI bet you're hard as stone\nLiving in your world alone\nI hope you let me in tonight\nThey want me to beware\nYou're dangerous, but I don't care\nI can't wait to have you in my arms\n\nAnd maybe I'm naive for loving you\nYou're a cheating liar\nBut tonight you're everything I desire\n\nYou beautiful sinner\nI love your wicked heart\nBeautiful sinner\nIt's such a work of art\nI didn't know that bad could look so good\nYou are the type of bad that feels so good\nYou beautiful sinner\n\nMaybe you're the master of disguise\nAnd you are putting on and you're really the saint, the good one\nAre you here to save me from the crowd?\nIf you are then, baby, take me now\n\nBeautiful sinner\nI love your wicked heart\nBeautiful sinner\nIt's such a work of art\nI didn't know that bad could look so good (Oh, I didn't know)\nYou are the type of bad that feels so good\nYou beautiful sinner"}}, {"title": "Bed of Lies", "album": "The Pinkprint", "year": "2014-11-16", "lyrics": "Do you ever think of me when you lie?\nLie down in your bed, your bed of lies\nAnd I knew better than to look in your eyes\nThey only pretend you would be mine\nAnd oh, how you made me believe\nYou had me caught in every web that you weaved\nBut do you ever think of me when you lie?\nLie down in your bed, your bed of lies\n\nYou could never make eye contact\nEverything you got was based off of my contacts\nYou a fraud but I'mma remain icon-stat\nBalenciagas on my boots with a python strap\nYou was caught up in the rush and you was caught up in the thrill of it\nYou was with me way before I hit a quarter mil' in it\nPut you in the crib and you ain't never pay a bill in it\nI was killin' it, now you got me poppin' pills in it\nI told Baby hit you, I said this nigga buggin'\nCause I was doing it for us, I told 'em fuck the public\nCouldn't believe that I was home alone, contemplating\nOverdosin', no more coastin', no more toastin' over oceans\nThey say you don't know what you got 'til it's gone\nThey say that your darkest hour come before your dawn\nBut there was something that I should've asked all along\nI'mma ask on the song\n\nDo you ever think of me when you lie?\nLie down in your bed, your bed of lies\nAnd I knew better than to look in your eyes\nThey only pretend you would be mine\nAnd oh, how you made me believe\nYou had me caught in every web that you weaved\nBut do you ever think of me when you lie?\nLie down in your bed, your bed of lies\n\nI just figured if you saw me, if you looked in my eyes\nYou'd remember our connection and be freed from the lies\nI just figured I was something that you couldn't replace\nBut there was just a blank stare and I couldn't relate\nI just couldn't understand and I couldn't defend\nWhat we had, what we shared, and I couldn't pretend\nWhen the tears roll down, it's like you ain't even notice 'em\nIf you had a heart, I was hoping that you would show it some\nWhat the fuck you really telling me? What you telling me?\nI could tell you lying, get the fuck out, don't yell at me\nI ain't mean to cut you, I ain't wanna catch a felony\nThis ain't How To Be A Player, you ain't Bill Bellamy\nThey say you don't know what you got 'til it's gone\nThey say that your darkest hour come before your dawn\nBut there was something that I should've asked, all along\nI'mma ask on the song\n\nSo does she know I've been in that bed before?\nA thousand count, and not a single thread of truth\nIf I was just another girl\nThen I'm ashamed to say that I'm not over you\nThere's one thing I need to know\nSo, call me when you're not so busy just thinking of yourself\n\nDo you ever think of me when you lie?\nLie down in your bed, your bed of lies\nAnd I knew better than to look in your eyes\nThey only pretend you would be mine\nAnd oh, how you made me believe\nYou had me caught in every web that you weaved\nBut do you ever think of me when you lie?\nLie down in your bed, your bed of lies", "image": "https://images.rapgenius.com/6ccb5ac616e0df89bf4b012898a9711e.640x640x1.jpg", "artist": "Nicki Minaj", "raw": {"annotation_count": 27, "api_path": "/songs/574971", "description": {"dom": {"tag": "root", "children": [{"tag": "p", "children": ["Nicki Minaj introduced this single at the 2014 MTV Europe Music Awards."]}, "", {"tag": "p", "children": ["This track finally addresses ", {"tag": "a", "attributes": {"href": "http://rap.genius.com/Nicki-minaj-only-lyrics"}, "data": {"api_path": "/songs/555359"}, "children": ["rumors"]}, " regarding her previous boyfriend, ", {"tag": "a", "attributes": {"href": "http://nickiminaj.wikia.com/wiki/Safaree_%22SB%22_Samuels", "rel": "nofollow"}, "children": ["Safaree \u201cSB\u201d Samuels"]}, "."]}, "", {"tag": "p", "children": ["Co-writer Skylar Grey, who wrote and sang the demo before Nicki Minaj got ahold of the song, said that one of her original verses ended up as the bridge but another verse she had written never came out.

lies\nAnd I knew better than to look in your eyes\nThey only pretend you would be mine\nAnd oh, how you made me believe\nYou had me caught in every web that you weaved\nBut do you ever think of me when you lie?\nLie down in your bed, your bed of lies\n\nYou could never make eye contact\nEverything you got was based off of my contacts\nYou a fraud but I'mma remain icon-stat\nBalenciagas on my boots with a python strap\nYou was caught up in the rush and you was caught up in the thrill of it\nYou was with me way before I hit a quarter mil' in it\nPut you in the crib and you ain't never pay a bill in it\nI was killin' it, now you got me poppin' pills in it\nI told Baby hit you, I said this nigga buggin'\nCause I was doing it for us, I told 'em fuck the public\nCouldn't believe that I was home alone, contemplating\nOverdosin', no more coastin', no more toastin' over oceans\nThey say you don't know what you got 'til it's gone\nThey say that your darkest hour come before your dawn\nBut there was something that I should've asked all along\nI'mma ask on the song\n\nDo you ever think of me when you lie?\nLie down in your bed, your bed of lies\nAnd I knew better than to look in your eyes\nThey only pretend you would be mine\nAnd oh, how you made me believe\nYou had me caught in every web that you weaved\nBut do you ever think of me when you lie?\nLie down in your bed, your bed of lies\n\nI just figured if you saw me, if you looked in my eyes\nYou'd remember our connection and be freed from the lies\nI just figured I was something that you couldn't replace\nBut there was just a blank stare and I couldn't relate\nI just couldn't understand and I couldn't defend\nWhat we had, what we shared, and I couldn't pretend\nWhen the tears roll down, it's like you ain't even notice 'em\nIf you had a heart, I was hoping that you would show it some\nWhat the fuck you really telling me? What you telling me?\nI could tell you lying, get the fuck out, don't yell at me\nI ain't mean to cut you, I ain't wanna catch a felony\nThis ain't How To Be A Player, you ain't Bill Bellamy\nThey say you don't know what you got 'til it's gone\nThey say that your darkest hour come before your dawn\nBut there was something that I should've asked, all along\nI'mma ask on the song\n\nSo does she know I've been in that bed before?\nA thousand count, and not a single thread of truth\nIf I was just another girl\nThen I'm ashamed to say that I'm not over you\nThere's one thing I need to know\nSo, call me when you're not so busy just thinking of yourself\n\nDo you ever think of me when you lie?\nLie down in your bed, your bed of lies\nAnd I knew better than to look in your eyes\nThey only pretend you would be mine\nAnd oh, how you made me believe\nYou had me caught in every web that you weaved\nBut do you ever think of me when you lie?\nLie down in your bed, your bed of lies"}}, {"title": "Beef Stew", "album": "Unreleased", "year": "2008-03-01", "lyrics": "Just when they thought I was done for the summer\nCame out the cupboard, show my ass like a plumber\nI ain't Chinese, but you're worth two dolla'\nTee get the bleach, I'm a show my true ca-la\nTell a nigga holla in the peach Impala\nOnly if he give good brain like a scholar\nA-la, a-la, a-la eyy!\nKnock your top off like a holiday\nDang, little mama, I should be in your pot\nCause everywhere I go they saying Nicki you're hot\nI catch more eyes than the letter with the dot\nSuper-size fries, my pies better be hot\nShe got it twisted like a cock-eyed bitch\nThat's why I be in Mr.Chows, you a Popeye's bitch\nYou the type to get some money, go spend it on some boots\nSave just enough for some douche for your cooch'\nIt ain't about money, you ain't speakin' my lang'\nCuttin' any bitch off if she enter my lane\nAnd it really ain't a thang, when I bang, I bang\nAnd my goons swing by like orangutans\nFuck wrong with you?

Cali with some of my best work\nYou niggas so lame that my bitches won't fuck unless you cut a check first\n\nYour bitch call me big daddy\nTell that bitch that I'm big daddy\nWhen I hit the lot I

wanna buy a heart?\nAnybody wanna buy a heart?\nCause I don't use the shit anyway\nBut okay, I guess it's my fault\nWestside shorty, with an eastside nigga\nThey say it's levels to this shit, I'm a G5 nigga\nAnd every city I be in, you know she fly with us\nIt's like Hov got Bey, it's like Bey got Jigga\nReally though let me take y'all back\n'09, double R drop top with the top down\nPulled up, double parked, hopped out, tried to spit my game\nIt didn't work, got shot down\nBut I can tell by the bag, by the wrist and the ring on that\nSomebody had it on lockdown\nThe moral of the story not to speak on that\nShe on the team, shorty mine now\nAnd we don't ever ever ever make love\nAnd we don't ever ever ever say \"love\"\nUnless I'm all up in it, she tellin' me she love that D on that, I don't ever say uh\nBad bitch, ain't nothin' made up\nAnybody, anybody, anybody wanna buy\nThe heart from a real one from Philly reppin' that north side?\n\nAnybody?

double parked, hopped out, tried to spit my game\nIt didn't work, got shot down\nBut I can tell by the bag, by the wrist and the ring on that\nSomebody had it on lockdown\nThe moral of the story not to speak on that\nShe on the team, shorty mine now\nAnd we don't ever ever ever make love\nAnd we don't ever ever ever say \"love\"\nUnless I'm all up in it, she tellin' me she love that D on that, I don't ever say uh\nBad bitch, ain't nothin' made up\nAnybody, anybody, anybody wanna buy\nThe heart from a real one from Philly reppin' that north side?\n\nAnybody?

on me\nBut hey, maybe I'll never win, maybe I'm settlin'\nCan't let the devil in, I'm a comic book heroine\nBut when the wind blows, I'm so Marilyn\n(I'm so Marilyn, Marilyn, Marilyn)\nYo, write it down, take a pictures, bitches, e-mail that\nI came to save a thing called female rap\nBut I hope my ninja powers\nDon't fuck around and offend you cowards\nYou mad at me cause you think I got it easy\nIf we was in the second grade, then you would tease me\nYa see, you still a lil snotty-nose hood rat\n\"I love Nicki\" scribbled all over you book bag\nI love you too\nI just wish your mother would've hugged you too\nYou know Nicki love the kids\nYellow brick road, lookin' for the Wiz\nBut when it rains, it pours for real\nDef Jam said I'm no Lauryn Hill\nCan't rap and sing on the same CD\nThe public won't get it, they got A.D.D\nSee Nicki, follow the rules\nGo and say your prayers and get ready for school\n(Yeah, follow the rules)\n(Let me say my prayers and get ready for school)\nDear God, I am only what you made me\nAnd I appreciate everything that you gave me\nBut like, I don't wanna do it no more\nSort of lost sight of what I'm doin' it for\nThought that I was doin' somethin' good for the game\nUntil they all started throwin' dirt on my name\nTell Debbie, I really, really tried\nThat I said I'm sorry, but I had to say goodbye\nTell Fendi, I'll never forget him\nAnd please tell Wayne I'll always be indebted\n(I'll never forget it)\n(Please tell Wayne I'll always be indebted)\n\nAy! Can anybody hear me?\nAy! Can anybody hear me?\nAy! Can anybody hear me?\nAy! Can anybody hear me?"}}, {"title": "Can't Stop Thinking About You", "album": null, "year": null, "lyrics": "Can't stop thinking about, stop thinking -\nI can't stop thinking about you\nCan't stop

in the stash\n50 Cent Italian, icy flow\nThis is that Run-and-Get-a-Dollar-for-The-Ice-Cream-Cone\n'cause they killed my little cousin Nicholas\nBut my memory's, only happy images\nThis is for the

apple, cherry, even lemon lime\nWhat you want them B cups or them C cups?\nFor your ice cream, chocolate or butter P cups\nFrench vanilla threesomes that come in D cups\nThey eat each other but otherwise they don't eat much\nI'm bout that fast money, money ain't got no patience\nBut if them boys come, run like you on probation\nListen up, I'm a send ya to the location\nWrite it down, take a picture, make a notation\n\n\nRelax lil' nigga cut the bull, cut it out\nWe tax niggas no deductible, get it out\nSo what it is, what it ain't, nigga state ya name\nYou know we got them umbrellas if you make it rain\nSo what you want them good girls or them bad ones\nI got them girls make you wish ya never had none\nCause you'll be spending beaucoup in my spot, shorty\nThis nigga acting brand new like he just bought it\nUp and away like Mighty Mice\nYou can say I am the rap game Heidi Fleiss\nCause my flow crazy, Hussein like Sadam\nYou getting it, I got 'em, I'm the rap bitch madam\nI'm the

you in hopes that I could steer you back\nBut it's like every intersection we just missed each other\nYou got your fans waitin' tell me you ain't six feet under\nAnd tell me that you comin' back and you just took a break\nMaybe I blamed you for everything that was my mistake\nIn hindsight, I loved your rawness and I loved your edge\nCause it was you who talked me down from jumping off the ledge\nYour earings bamboo, your long nails too\nYour BMW everytime you came through\nYou was the braveheart,you stole Wayne heart\nYou never switched it up, you played the same part\nBut I needed to grow, and I needed to know\nWere there some things inside of me, that I needed to show\nSo I just deaded you, left you in all black\nBut dear old Nicki, please call back\n\nYou told me, you'd come when I needed you\nAnd you said it so sweetly, I believed you\nBut I'm standing here calling, I can't see you\nBut I am holdin' you, holdin' you, holdin' you\nTo that\n\nYo, did I chase the glitz and glamour, money, fame, and power?\nCause if so, that will forever go down my lamest hour\nI should've kept you with me, gettin' at them nameless cowards\nThey was no match for you, couldn't defeat your prowess\nI had to make them changes, I hoped you understood\nYou see for every bad, I did a ton of good\nBut you was underground, and I was mainstream\nI live the life now, that we would daydream\nMy only wish, is you come enjoy it with me\nGet on them conference calls, go meet the lawyers with me\nThe money came yeah, tripled and quadrupled it\nBut I still miss us, when we was just on some stupid shit\nAnd it's still fuck the media they ridiculed you, never believed in ya\nThey just deaded you, left you in all black\nBut dear old Nicki, please call back\n\nAnd yes I'm holdin' you, holdin' you, holdin' you\nAnd yes I'm holdin' you, holdin' you, holdin' you\nAnd yes I'm holdin' you, holdin' you, holdin' you\nTo that\nAnd yes I'm holdin' you, holdin' you, holdin' you\nAnd yes I'm holdin' you,

Okay. Nicki Minaj. Dirty Money. I don't think ya'll understand what I'm about to do, I'm 'bout to master these bitches, man. Chea!

I gotta laugh at it\nI always got crack, I guess I'm a crack addict\n\nI don't know man. I think these bitches is real scared right now, like. Damn. I got these bitches shaking in they boots, man. Dirty money. Ayo, Pre'. Bring the next verse in, my nigga. Chea! Chea! Chea! One time\n\nI used to make a dollar stretch like a Pilate\nNow I gotta play the potty in Giuseppe Zanotti\nGotta push the Maserati, candy paint on the body\nMaking money off the hobby, taking flicks in the lobby\nLook, I'm in the future, I'm ahead of my time\nAnd you can't duplicate it, I'm a one-of-a-kind\nThey think I'm making fun of them, when I be like: \"Na-Na-Na-Na!\"\nThat's the track, little mama. Look: \"Na-Na-Na-Na!\"\nDo what I do it, like I do it for the T.V\nBitches must be blind, cause these bitches can't see me\nDo it all for GP, tell 'em to suck a pee-pee\nMonday, LA, Tuesday, I'm in DC\nGet a ticket, or you only get a snippet\nIf you write your lyrics,  little mama, I can dig it\nI show you how to do it, what I do is really magic\nAbracadab' tricks are for kids, silly rabbit\n\nYes sir. If I ain't the one, who is, nigga? I mean damn, I don't mean to toot my own goddamn horn, but toot-toot, nigga! Fuck! I'm that bitch. Nicki Minaj. Dirty Money. Yes sir. Uh-huh.

Riddle me that\nMami you itty bitty can't mirror me back\nEverybody gon' see where I'm lyrically at\nUsed to hate Nicki, now they givin' me dap\nI live and I learn,  but I wait my turn\nI'm always on the run, got weight to burn\nEase off the gas, then I make a turn\nThree off the pass, they don't play like her\nWhy I can't just be ill?\nWhy when they see me, bitches gotta to go \"Ew\"?\nWhy my lil' nigga, still gotta sell krills?\nWhy I'm this hot and still didn't get a deal?\nThe rain and the pain, I done paid my dues\nI'm ready for the game, I done laced my shoes\nEverything I say believe I'm gon' do\nCame out the coop, Petite Vuitton boots\n\nCan I get an encore I know you want more\nI know you sick of all them girls, they such a bore\nBut it's my time I need y'all to roar\nIt's my time I need y'all to  roar\n(What the hell are you waiting for?)\nAfter me, there shall be no more\nIt's my time I need y'all to roar\n(What the hell are you waiting for?)\n\nLook what you made me do, look what I made for you\nKnow when I paid my dues, that I would aim for you\nStraight from the streets of Queens and yet it seems\nThe only thing they know, is that I push a beam\nAll they see's a pretty face, how I ride the base\nSo I put my hoodie down just to hide my face\nThey don't see the tears I cry, the fears I hide\nTend to keep my cares inside, it's merely pride\nLike my grandmother, I wonder if she next to pop\nSaid the next time I seen her she would be in a box\nDamn she was right, she was dead right\nHow was I to know, that would be her last night?\nIf I could turn back the time\nDear God, somehow could you press rewind?\nWon't come when I call, but He just in time\nSo I come when He call, like I'm next in line\nWhen you got something good why the Devil gotta ruin it?\nGuess she never know, I be the best bitch doing it\n\nTired of being what you want me to be\nFeeling so faithless, lost under the surface\nDon't know what you're expecting of me\nPut under the pressure of walking in your shoes\n(Caught in the undertow just caught in the undertow)\nEvery step that I take is another mistake to you\n(Caught in the undertow just caught in the undertow)\nAnd every second I waste is more than I can take\nI've become so numb I can't feel you there\nBecome so tired so much more aware\nI'm becoming this all I want to do\nIs be more like me and be less like you\nI've become so numb\n\nCan I get an encore\nI know you want more\n(I've become so numb)\nBut it's my time I need ya'll to roar\nIt's my time I need ya'll to roar"}}, {"title": "Envy", "album": "Beam Me Up Scotty", "year": "2009-04-18", "lyrics": "Envy, all they do is envy\nDon't they know what's in me?\nDon't they know I'm coming back?

you gave it up in the end\nAnd you were the one to let me know it's over\nI tried so hard but in the end\nI failed again\nBelieved in every word that came through your theeth\nI though to myself that you meant everything\n'Cause that's the way you made it seem\nSo for now I'm gonna let it go\nIt isn't worth deeping this hole\nWhere my heart used to be\nSo I'm gonna let it be...\nYeah yeah

did'nt really need me\nNurse the wounds but they're still open\nFrom the seams watch it bleed\nAnd I didn't wanna see it coming\nWhen you gave it up in the end\nAnd you were the one to let me know

rider\nYou know that you need a rider, babe\nYou know that you need a rider\nYou know that you need a rider, babe, ah yeah...\n\nYo, I just wanna be ya rider, you should pull up in that Spyder\nYou should let me hit the mic, and I ain't talking about the fighter\nGet it lit without a lighter, let's pull an all-nighter\nTell me-tell me what you need, got the weed, I'm a bad little bitch and I never indict her\nGet locked, I'mma write ya, you on the road? I'mma Skype ya\nI don't wanna hype ya, but you a lucky nigga if my mean ass like ya\nYou ain't never have a bitch understand you, most of them wanna use you when they ran through\nI just wanna be somebody that can add to, your wife, be a friend, be a teacher and a fan too\nI just wanna listen, when you leave I say \"damn, I fucking miss him\"\nI just wanna be your vixen, give you something real wet to put your lips in\nI wanna be the only one that can check you, and still respect you\nCause it's you I would change for, you always make sure\n\nI just wanna be your favorite\nI just wanna be your favorite\nI just wanna be your favorite\nI just wanna be your favorite\nWon't you let me be your favorite?\n\nAyo, I just wanna be your first go to, do you like a real one supposed to, livin' bi-coastal\nScoop me in the truck, late night on a humble\nMeet me out in Queens, where the city want a sundown\nYou could put your gun down, you could have fun now\nYou could tell you niggas that you won now, one down\nRun through the clubs with the baddest, bitches is the maddest, nothin' else matters\nAnd they say Birkin where the bag is, got a lot of bags, but we never got baggage\nWinter Wonderland on my hands, call me Alice, balance\nI'mma have you coming in my palace\nLondon, Tokyo, Paris, let me update your status\nCause it's you I would change for, you always make sure\n\nI just wanna be your favorite\nI just wanna be your favorite\nI just wanna be your favorite\nI just wanna be your favorite\nWon't you let me be your favorite?\n\nYou should already know\nYou should already know\nYou should already know\nYou should already know\n(You know that you need a rider\nYou know that you need a rider, babe\nYou know that you need a rider\nYou know that you need a rider, babe, ayy\nI just wanna be your favorite\nI just wanna be your favorite)\nYou should already know, you should already know\n(I just wanna be your favorite)\nYou should already know, you should already

down in your sleep and you choke on every lie you told\nAnd when you\u2019re reaching out for me, you\u2019ll see you reap everything you sow\n\nYou piece of shit, you broke me down\nThought you said you, would hold me down\nBut I can see it in your eyes that your blinded by the flashing lights\nAnd you's a stupid muthafucker for letting this thing pass you by\n\nI hope your fire, fire burns, baby\nI hope your fire, fire burns, baby\nI hope you lay down in your sleep and you choke on every lie you told\nAnd when you\u2019re reaching out for me, you\u2019ll see you reap everything you

about that boy who just got shot, I gots no information\nThese broke ass snitch niggas still gram shaving\nAt the precinct writing statements on which trap house is the station {\u200bDAMN}\u200b\nNot

back of them {\u200bTHERE HE GO}\u200b\nBack seat informer, your papi shoulda warned ya\nYou even tell PoPo I\u2019m black, then you's a fucking goner\nYeah you get high, but I get higher\nManyana, I just might go to the halfway house and ask your supervisor\nChorus\nNicki Minaj\nYo\u2026 4, 3, 2\nCocka doodle do\nI was out in Africa, Shaka Zulu crew\nHo ho ho, red stockings too\nComing down the chimney, you're chopped n' screwed\nIt\u2019s me bitches, eff you snitches, gimmie the heebie jeebies\nSo excuse my twitches (Excuse me!)\nLemme get that brewski, niggas know them bitches can\u2019t do it like I dooski\nI just pull up, chuck the deuce in some blue denim, and I just heard he running with the lieutenant\nI\u2019m the mistress, I be in the District of Columbia\nYes uh huh, Washington\nBetter ask around, cause I\u2019m what's popping-ton\nI\u2019m who they think about, playing with they pee pee\nGotta count sheep b, cause I\u2019m never sleepy\nYes, I\u2019m the chief,

nigga\nSo I\u2019mma bring you to the bottom of the ocean \nI hear you preaching like a fucking reverend\nShould've killed you in the first place, no second guessing\nCould've killed 'em with the first and the second weapon\nDJ Unk 'em with the hand, I two-step and deck 'em\nThen I grab the choppa, blue flame Houston wreck em\nKick a snitch head through a goal like David Beckham\nMake way, respect em\nI could AK attack em\nYou looking at a gangster in his essence\nNow bitch bow down when a gangster in your presence\nCause I\u2019m God\u2019s gift like a present\nFor one don\u2019t try

you for abandoning me\nPrayin' but I think I'm still an angel away\nAngel away, yeah its strange in a way\nMaybe that is why I chase strangers away\nThey got they guns out aimin' at me\nBut I become Neo when they aimin' at me, me, me\nMe against them, me against enemies, me against friends\nSomehow they both seem to become one\nA sea full of sharks and they all smell blood\nThey start comin' and I start risin'\nMust be surprisin', I'm just surmisin'\nI win, thrive, soar, higher, higher, higher, more flya'\n\nI came to win, to fight, to conquer, to thrive\nI came to win, to survive, to prosper, to rise\nTo fly, To fly\n\nEverybody wanna' try to box me in\nSuffocatin' everytime it locks me in\nPaintin' their own pictures then they crop me in\nBut I will remain where the top begins\n'Cause I am not a word, I am not a line\nI am not a girl that could ever be defined\nI am not fly, I am levitation, I represent an entire generation\nI hear the criticism loud and clear, that is how I know that the time is near\nSee we become alive in the time of fear, and I ain't got no muthafuckin' time to spare\nCry my eyes out for days upon days\nSuch a heavy burden placed upon me\nBut when you go hard your nays become yays\nYankee stadium with Jays and Kanyes\n\nI came to win, to fight, to conquer, to thrive\nI came to win, to survive, to prosper, to rise\nTo fly, To fly\n\nGet

when he died on the cross\nCause your spirit is ungrateful\nBitches is so hateful, I remain a staple\nMy career's been the pinkprint\nWhen I retire, tell 'em think pink\nPink Friday is the imprint\nAnd these bitches basic, instinct\nOh shit, my commercial's on\nDid I really body bitches with commercial songs?\nDid I really prophecy every thing I do?\nBut before I continue let me thank my crew\nSo that was Young Wayne, Mack Maine, Baby and Slim came\nTezz and EI told me it wouldn't be in vain\nCause prior to me signing I could've went insane\nAnd even now I think, \"Do I really want this fame?\"\nLet me get up and go, 700 to go overseas for a show\nEverybody get quiet when I'm starting the show\nMan, I'm birthing these artists and I'm starting to show\n\nI feel free, I feel freedom\nWhy they mad? You should see them\nBurn an L cause it's crazy in here\nCrazy in here, crazy in here\nI feel free, I feel freedom\nWhy they mad? You should see them\nBurn an L cause it's crazy in here\nCrazy in here, crazy in here\n\nWho I wanna work with? Nobody! 99% of them is nobody\nBitches acting like they killing shit, OK\nWhen I check these bitches guns, no bodies\nThese niggas is fake fucks and opportunists\nNiggas spend they last dime to say the copped the soonest\nWhy these niggas going broke to get your approval?\nPretty soon, they'll be back up on them Ramen Noodles\nB-B-B-bible, Queen is the title\nAnd if you are my rival, then that means you're suicidal\nAnd if you in the club then it's a Young Money recital\nI'm just that vital, I'm busy, never idle\nI'm ya idol, I'm ya idol, I'm ya mothafuckin' idol\nPink Friday in Macy's, thongs and some pasties\n(Yo, what other female rapper perfume in here? Cause I must've missed it)\n12 milli to kick my feet up, get ready this is the Re-up\n\nI feel free, I feel freedom\nWhy they mad? You should see them\nBurn an L cause it's crazy in here\nCrazy in here, crazy in here\n\nMirror, mirror, won't you realize? I just have to decide\nWhat you hiding from? What you hiding from?\nHiding baby\nMirror, mirror, won't you realize? I just have to decide\nWhat you hiding from? What you hiding from?\nHiding baby\nWould you, would you, give your\nWould you, would you, give your\nWould you, would you, give your all for yours\n\nI feel free, I feel freedom\nWhy they mad?

been in love with me ever since we were in 6th grade\nMs. Hills' class, I'm just thinkin', ah, oh\nMighty funny didn't notice her back then\nBut now her body bangin', got me thinkin', ah, oh\nI'm just

dreams of her and me, she couldn't sleep\nShe tellin' me to come and get it all, get it all\nShe so glad the girlfriend that I used to have didn't wanna treat me right\nSo she told me I could get it

gotta chuckle, excuse the duffle\nI mean my ring so big it just bruise my knuckle\nAnd I just heard that you was back on the market\nLet me stick shift, ride it, back it up, and then park it\n'Cause you and me, we should be together\nCop da matchin' Lamborghini, Swahili leather\nNow dat dat dat dat's black on black\nAnd if the bitch call ya phone, that's a back hand smack\nNigga what?\nShe told

swimsuit issue of SI\nShe told me to don't leave her until I know I'da got over the whole fever\nAnd I can't stop\nBest believe me she gon' get it all\nBest believe me she gon' get it all\nShe said

say pretty please\nBaby, just say pretty please (Pretty please!)\n\nI'll be back at eleven, you just act like a peasant\nGot a bow on my panties, because my ass is a present\nYeah it's gooder than Meagan, you look good when you're beggin'\nI be laughing when you beggin' me, to just put the head in\nLet me sit on your face, it's ok you can play with it\nWhen I'm bouncin' it, chill out and don't you make a mistake with it\nLet me see what you're workin' with, If I'm ridin', I'm murkin' it\nSlow grindin', I'm twerkin' it, yeah I bagged him, I Birkin'd it\n\nI don't need a dozen roses\nYou ain't gotta wine and dine me, no\nI don't need a pretty poet\nOooh, gettin' all emotional\nYou gotta beg for it, beg for it\nI wanna see you lookin' up\nBaby I'ma need you to beg for it\n\nGet on your knees, get on your knees, get on your knees\nBaby, just get on your knees (On your knees!)\nSay pretty please, say pretty please, say pretty please\nBaby, just say pretty please (Pretty please!)\n\nGimme brain, assume the position\nMake me way smarter, like you was a magician\nPaid my dues and tuition, it's good for your nutrition\nGet head like a beautician, got me twitchin', finish your mission\nYou make it come down, you make it run down\nI'ma need you to give these other dudes the rundown\nYou got that legendary, this shit is fake, scary\nGot me seein' them fireworks, I'm on my Kate Perry\n\nI don't need a dozen roses\nYou ain't gotta wine and dine me, no\nI don't need a pretty poet\nOooh, gettin' all emotional\nYou gotta beg for it, beg for it\nI wanna see you lookin' up\nBaby I'ma need you to beg for it\n\n(Let's go)\nCause we are just animals\nBaby it's primal (it's primal....)\nI want you on all fours\n(And before I let you walk, you gotta show me how you crawl)\nIf you want it all (Yeah, you want it all?)\nIt's non negotiable\nSo do as I say\n(If you wanna get the job, you better know who's the boss)\n\nI don't need a dozen roses\nYou ain't gotta wine and dine me, no\nI don't need a pretty poet\nOooh, gettin' all emotional\nYou gotta beg for it, beg for it\nI wanna see you lookin' up\nBaby I'ma need you to beg for it\n\nGet on your knees, get on

because my ass is a present\nYeah it's gooder than Meagan, you look good when you're beggin'\nI be laughing when you beggin' me, to just put the head in\nLet me sit on your face, it's ok you can play with it\nWhen I'm bouncin' it, chill out and don't you make a mistake with it\nLet me see what you're workin' with, If I'm ridin', I'm murkin' it\nSlow grindin', I'm twerkin' it, yeah I bagged him, I Birkin'd it\n\nI don't need a dozen roses\nYou ain't gotta wine and dine me, no\nI don't need a pretty poet\nOooh, gettin' all emotional\nYou gotta beg for it, beg for it\nI wanna see you lookin' up\nBaby I'ma need you to beg for it\n\nGet on your knees, get on your knees, get on your knees\nBaby, just get on your knees (On your knees!)\nSay pretty please, say pretty please, say pretty please\nBaby, just say pretty please (Pretty please!)\n\nGimme brain, assume the position\nMake me way smarter, like you was a magician\nPaid my dues and tuition, it's good for your nutrition\nGet head like a beautician, got me twitchin', finish your mission\nYou make it come down, you make it run down\nI'ma need you to give these other dudes the rundown\nYou got that legendary, this shit is fake, scary\nGot me seein' them fireworks, I'm on my Kate Perry\n\nI don't need a dozen roses\nYou ain't gotta wine and dine me, no\nI don't need a pretty poet\nOooh, gettin' all emotional\nYou gotta beg for it, beg for it\nI wanna see you lookin' up\nBaby I'ma need you to beg for it\n\n(Let's go)\nCause we are just animals\nBaby it's primal (it's primal....)\nI want you on all fours\n(And before I let you walk, you gotta show me how you crawl)\nIf you want it all (Yeah, you want it all?)\nIt's non negotiable\nSo do as I say\n(If you wanna get the job, you better know who's the boss)\n\nI don't need a dozen roses\nYou ain't gotta wine and dine me, no\nI don't need a pretty poet\nOooh, gettin' all emotional\nYou gotta beg for it, beg for it\nI wanna see you lookin' up\nBaby I'ma need you to beg for it\n\nGet on your knees, get on your knees, get on your knees\nBaby, just get on your knees (On your knees!)\nSay pretty please, say pretty please, say pretty please\nBaby, just say

long weave, short cuts\nYou know the flow sick, came in on the small bus\nSo give the D-cup, C-cup, small bust\nThey judge me like the girl's on trial\nBut every time that I come out it's just girls gone wild\nGot the domino effect in the front row passing out\nWith little bikini tops they got they asses hanging out\nSay my shoe game nuts, so I call \u2018em cashews\nEvery other city there's another Nicki tattoo\nSteal Wayne girls, I steal Drake girls\nYou know the real bitches love me, fuck the fake girls\nSo if you pretty I sign titties\nI got the key to every mothafucking city\n\nThese

bitch Angelina Jolie\nMaterial girls like Madonna,model for Donatella\nAin't nothing you can tell her, cause she get the Mozzarella\nShe look just like Rihanna,,she\nWork with Wilhelmina only rocking Galliano\nShe might be Filipino, be sipping Pellegrino\nBe watching Al Pacino, she could probably sniff a kilo\nAnyway yo, hit up Grace Jones and tell her I said Strang\u00e9\nI\u2019m out in Paris motherfucker with Beyonc\u00e9\n\nThese girls fall like dominoes, dominoes\nThese girls fall like dominoes, d-d-dominoes\nThese girls fall like dominoes, dominoes\nThese girls fall like dominoes,

Hit him on the walkie-talkie\nHit 'em, hit em, knock-knock, tell 'em let me in, my name ring bells, bitch buzz me in (BZZZZ!)\nAnd I only stop for pedestrians (Oh!) Or a real, real bad lesbian\nHit 'em with the MAC, hit 'em with the TEC-nine,hit 'em with the Ruger, by the intersect sign\nHit 'em with a Tommy, so my niggas call me Pammy\nAnd I always keep the jammy, in the trunk or in the Lamby (O-WAH!\nPut my whole borough on my back and I'm good-a\nI don't wanna hear what you would, what you could-a\nI represent all the girls that stood up (Uhn!)\nUsed to drink water with a little bit of sugar (Oh..)\nNow I'm in the gym with my squats and my sit-ups (One, two! \"Breathes\")\nDoing the scissor-leg, on the mat, with my foot up\nYoung black pin-up, all of my bitches did up\nNow I'm telling LA Reid, to step his bid up\nAnd I'm telling President Carter, he picked a winner,bitches like Nelly and Kelly, got a dilemma\nThese birds all fly south, in the winter\nFuck I look like?

Hit him on the walkie-talkie\nHit 'em, hit em, knock-knock, tell 'em let me in, my name ring bells, bitch buzz me in (BZZZZ!)\nAnd I only stop for pedestrians (Oh!)

C'mon, listen...\n\nYe' ain't say nothing lil' mama I got those\nAnd I'm about to bl-blow like snot nose\nOh no, no homo\nThis is for my niggas, my niggas that don't know\nPlease tell these rap bitches to get ready\nDon't get gassed unless you're getting getty\nDon't get jerk j-jerk don't get nutty\nFix up your paper work you're somebody\nBut you ain't better than the President\nI'm just too eloquent, bitch, I'm the President!\nI be sitting on a elephant counting all my money where Stella went\nAnd I don't need my groove back unless the nigga looking like 2Pac\nUnless he got colors like Tucan, Sam\nSam, I am! Different color Lambs (Green Eggs and Ham)\nBet I could bake a gram like the baker's man\nStop running up on me like who? what? when?\nI stay around the white like the Ku Klux Klan\nI stay around the sand butter pecan tan, butter pecan tan\nI stay around the sand butter pecan tan nigga\n\nDamn, I'm a bad bitch I'mma give y'all a couple more bars it's nothin.. Listen....\n\nI was shotgun when the Bentley cruised up\nI'm a bad bitch let me put my shoes up\nI don't say hi, I just throw my 2's up\nWhen I'm in Texas I chuck my deuce up\nBitches is snakes sorta like Medusa\nI get on the beats like a new producer\n(i hate nicki minaj) just excuse her\nI'm in a GT, she in a PT Cruiser, I mean the PT bruiser\nDang lil mama you is such a loser\nYou is such a loser, dang lil mama you is such a loser...\n\nI mean... If I'm not the baddest bitch who the fuck is?\nI mean when I do it's done. Get who you want..\nLike, I'mma body every last bitch in the game\nI'mma sit on my throne and you know these bitches you know be pickin my fruit out\nI want some fresh strawberries and shit tell them bitches to be ready to pick my fruit out\nI'm a be sittin on the throne like Michael Jackson and Eddie Murphy, it's nothin "}}, {"title": "Gun Shot", "album": "Pink Friday: Roman Reloaded", "year":

summer jam fan\nWhere are my bands, where my \"Rubber Band Mans\"?\n\nIt's official, bang your pistols\nPlay your money it's funny, I mean it tickles\nI need a D-boy, I need a president\nAnd if you're spending them stacks, I need some evidence\nThen you can bring out all them cars, that they rap about\nThen I'm a let you eat it, like I put the snacks out\nDon't say you can't, say you can, say you can can\nFlip that money, flip it like a handstand\n\n\nHe's a banker by nature and he'll call and\nStick up the debt, that you owe and thank ya\nHe'll switch the toys out, never the same route\nBut niggas acting, like they ain't about to pay out\nTaking me out, just to ask how my day went\nTryna show me, I'm his number one investment\nHe know what I like, stay on your job type\nI'll pop if you can pop like you got rubber bands, we like\n\n\n\nCause we like, bad boys and bad cars\nThem hood rich, dope boys and trap stars. \n\nSee I'm a rubber lover\nSo wrap it and I'll hug ya\nThen we can stick together\nLike them dollars out the printer\nBad boys I catch, call me undercover\nStreet grindin', cold cut mother- (fucker)\n\nYo yo yo-\nHe flip like handstand, he cookin' them ten grams\nGive him the grand slam, in back of the phan dam\nI mean the phantom, I can't stand bums\nSomethin' bout his money, make a nigga handsome\nCuff cuff, throw ya badge on me\nGuaranteed, you can't puff puff, pass on me\nWe can crush crush, you can spend your stash on me\nCause I know, you want to smash, like a crash dummy"}}, {"title": "Hell Yeah", "album": "Pink Friday: Roman Reloaded - The

It\u2019s funny, this song is probably the last song people would expect to here from me but it has to be in my top 3 faves on the album. I\u2019d listen to this song for hours on the plane or at home and pray for the day when I\u2019d truly feel accepted. For me. Not for who everyone thinks I am. Not for who people want me to be. But for me. Here I am. Hate it or love it. Here I am. I\u2019ve given all I had to give. I fought. I failed. I won. I cried. I laughed. I screamed. I\u2019m ready.

Mercedes\nAnd I might pop a couple of them Percocets\nYeah, that'll make me transform to Hercules\n\nI am who I am, uh!\nHere I am, here I am, so take me, as I am\nHere I am, here I am, so take me, as

fight your soul\nCause the second time around I'll be twice as bold\nSo do you take me to be who I am?\nTo have and to hold 'till death do us part?\nCause if not it's just best we both part\nCause how am I supposed finish what you start?\nYou got me thinkin' twice to just breathe\nThen you say I won't survive if I leave\nBut I got a couple of tricks up my sleeve\nI no longer need your attention, at ease\n\nIt's a joke, it's a game, why am I still keeping score\nI'm in pain, I'm ashamed, I'm a woman hear me roar\nIt's a joke, it's a game, why am I still keeping score\nI'm in pain, I'm ashamed,

money with the movers and the shakers\nHe was mixed with a couple things, ball like a couple rings\nBricks in the condo and grams to Sing Sing\nLeft arm, baby mother tatted\n5-year bid up north when they ratted\nAnyway, I felt him, helped him, put him on lock, seat belt him\nTook him out to Belgium, welcome\nBitches this pretty, that's seldom\nThis box better than the box he was held in\nI'm Momma Dee in that order, I call him Daddy like daughters\nHe like it when I get drunk, but I like it when he be sober\nThat's top of the toppa, I never fuck with beginners\nI let him play with my pussy then lick it off of his fingers\nI'm in the zone\n\nThey holler at me but it's you\nYou, this ain't high school\nMe and my crew, we can slide through\nGive it to you whenever you want\nPut it wherever you want\nBaby, it's yours\nAnywhere, everywhere\nBaby, it's your world, ain't it?\nBaby, it's your world, ain't it?\n\nShe got a nigga at home, and one on the side\nBest friend is a dyke, they fucked around a few times\nHer and her momma alike, so all they do is fight\nI tell her make me some money, she tell me \"make me a wife\"\nI tell her, \"Bitch, you crazy, fuck wrong with you?\"\nAnd excuse my French, but I'm a long kisser\nAnd then she try to tell me I'm the only one that's hittin'\nAnd I say, \"What about them niggas?\" She say, \"What about them niggas?\"\nYou right, what you doing tonight?\nPut on something tight, don't judge me, I get life\nShe love me like a brother, but fuck me like a husband\nPussy like a oven, too hot to put my tongue in\nAll I had to do is rub it, the genie out the bottle\nPussy so wet, I'mma need goggles\nShe tell me that's it's mine, I tell her stop lying\nMine and who else? She say worry 'bout yourself\nLil Tune\n\nThey holler at me but it's you\nYou, this ain't high school\nMe and my crew, we can slide through\nGive it to you whenever you want\nPut it wherever you want\nBaby, it's yours\nAnywhere, everywhere\nBaby, it's your world, ain't it?\nBaby, it's your world, ain't it?\n\nI know you want it, boy\nI see you tryin'\nJust keep on pushin'\nI'm a let you slide in\nJust close your eyes and\nThis horizon\nIt's ready, come get you some\nYeah, yeah, yeah, yeah"}}, {"title": "Hood Story", "album": "Playtime is Over", "year": "2007-07-05", "lyrics": "Lemme tell a lil' story, about this dude I knew, he said -\nUsed to go to school out in L.I.U, he said -\nHe'd make me a bet, he'd own his own jet, and he'd\nShow me the city,from a bird's eye view, said he -\nCame from Jamaica, he had a lil' paper\nHe owned a couple acres, and then I caught the vapors\nThat's how we got together, on the bike -\nLate night, Kawasaki leathers (Ah huh!)

check who came with me\nI bought a couple 9\u2032s, plus the k's with me\nI breeze through Queens to check some bad bitches\nI stunt so hard, assess the damages\n'Cause this that oh, this is that oh\nAnd yes, I body bitches go get the bandages\nYoung yummy, fuck you got for me\nI hate a phony bitch that front that chum chummy\nI'm me top shotta' drop the top toppa'\nBig fat pussy with a icy watch\n\nI am your leader, yes, I am your leader\nYou're not a believer, suck a big dick\n\nWhen I fly, it's one letter and one number\nYou wack hoes could get hot for one summer\nAfter that the queen will still reign here\nI'm Santa Claus to these hoes without a reindeer\nSaint Nick, Ross, hey, Rick, I just got a toy, cost 850\nNow I'm in the hood, niggas is getting woodies\nHit up Hot Topic, Nicki Minaj hoodies\nI'm a brand. bitch, I'm a brand\nGo to Harlem, and get Cam\nIt's dipset, get your dick wet\nBoarded the big jet, and got a big check\nNow you tell me, who the fuck is winning\nI'm on my Russell Simmons, Nicki denim, Nicki linen\n\nI am your leader, yes, I am your leader\nYou're not a believer, suck a big dick\n\nJealous niggas is gossip, watch me tie up my laces\nBitches be jocking, tell by the look on they faces\n8 digits I'm clocking, a lot of gold in my bracelet\n7 figures on watches, I told my mama I made it\nMade a deal for my project, just give me 10 mill I'm gravy\nI went back to the projects in 2mil in Mercedes\nI get head from your lady, have her bill me later\nI'm old school with the hustle, just gave Rihanna my pager\nHeart break hotel, I'm in the A-Rod suite\nRolls Royce wood, I'm talking playoff seat\nKnow that boy busy cause he balling, I like to play all week\nMonday night with the \u2018RAW\u2019, I\u2019m Vince McMahon with a beat\nPower slamming them hammers I get you handle for free\nSo where the fuck is her manners, she gives brain while I tweet\nDM, in the BM, you cm, you bucking, you love it\nMotherfuckers on my dick, suck

got imported from Tokyo\nLooking like a shark, the nose call it Pinocchio\nWell off, wealthy, LV logo\nMiddle of July but the wrist on snowflow\nOnly do the Aspens, y'all can have the Poconos\nI'm sunny and you must suck collagen dose, Calogero\nRide the whip, 5 on the hip, live with the pies got 9 for the flip\nHigh with a bitch, she cry for the dick, oh my know why I'm fly as it gets\nNow I need an aspirin\nShe said \"You're only Cam'ron\"\nGirlfriend you don't know Cam'ron from nowhere so don't go tampering\nYou're just a nail I hammer\n'nother girl that's on my camera\nMy name you cannot slander at all girl, watch your manners\nShe run and tell her mother, \"I think I love him, Nana.\"\nBecause you sat upon my lap? Nah, I ain't Santa\nThey call me pied piper, OJ no glove I knife her\nNever been a lifer, even do Rikers\nWhy would I fight? Don\u2019t even like her\n\nI am your leader, yes, I am your leader\nYou're not a believer, suck a big dick\nI am your leader, yes, I am your leader\nYou're not a believer, suck a big dick"}}, {"title": "Ice Cream Man", "album": "Unreleased", "year": null, "lyrics": "Ch-ch-ch-cherries on the top man\nB-butterscotch jam\nP-put me some nuts in them cups\nThat's what's up man\nThat's my ice cream\nThat's my ice cream\nThat's my ice cream\nThat's my ice cream man\nSuch a thug boo\nI like your truck too\nWhen I get older I'mma come over and fuck you\n'Cuz that's my ice cream\nThat's my ice cream\nThat's my ice cream\nThat's my ice cream man man\n\nMy ice cream man, my rubber band man\nLike to rock a bandana, and, and\nHe need an antenna\nWay they watch him\nHe cuter than Santana\nIce cream man, make my ice cream quickly\nI'mma let it sit, I like my ice cream slippery\nHickory, Dickory, call me Mike Vickory\nI'mma bad bitch, woof woof, I'm so thickory\nCan I lick your, can I lick your ice cream cone\nDo it like E.T.

stop touchin' her\nHer pretty eyes is killin' me\nHer glossy lips is stealin' me\nAfter the club ma, we can chill in the V\nTonight is our night and ma, I feel free\n\nI feel free\nI'm rollin' with my

sick, hottest things out\nStreet fitted in bring 'em out, bring 'em out\nL.V. on the shoulder\nShe look right in the Rover\nIn the club, never sober\nBallers, we the niggas on the posters\nRockstar, so Sunny Bono\nCowboy, so Tony Romo\nShake down shawty, that's the logo\nFeel free, fuck the po-po\n\nHopped off the boat, I am such an immigrant\nWhy he get Nicki Minaj tatted on his ligament?\nWait, just for the record get wetter than fishermen\nPull up with some 26s up under the Michelins\nYou know I pop-pop-pop it like a pistol\nThat's why I keep my wrist looking like like a disco\nAnd everywhere I go they tell me that I'm pretty\nMy money slow, my money stupid, money ditsy\nMommy you bad but Nicki is badder\nStep your cookies up, go get you a ladder\nWe do it early like Cheerios and a bagel\nI feel freer than the slaves on the railroad\n\nYou think I'm lying\nI feel like I'm flying\nI feel like I'm finally free\nI'm free \n\nI feel free\nI'm rollin' with my niggas and we just

Hannah\nMo-mon-montana, so fix your antenna\nI keep three hoes, but don't call me Santa\nAnd I am flyer then reindeer in the winter (in the winter)\n\nI get crazy (x32)\n\nSo I got a bad bitch mentality\nCause I just came from another galaxy\nI be with the president up in the White House\nIf we in the Oval Office, then the lights out\nCause I am the Wicked Witch, I'm the Nickster\nAnd I keep a bad bitch on my GSX-R\nBut I leave her in a second for a thicker\nRockstar little mama with a guitar\nI mean, I'm Nicki L-M-N-O-winsky\nI mean, my name ring bells like Tinky\nI mean Tinker, tell that nigga link her\nCause I'm looking for some good brains from a thinker\n\nI get crazy (x32)\n\n1, 2, 3rd floor, hospital bound\nNiggas is doors and I knock niggas down\nStraightjacket

the fuck they gon' say\nI'm the best bitch doin' it, doin' it\nI'm the best bitch doin' it, doin' it\nI'm the best, best, best, best\nI'm the best, best, best, best\nI'm the best\nI remember when I couldn't buy my mother a couch\nNow I'm sittin' at the closin' bought my mother a house\nYou could never understand why I grind like I do\nMikiyah and Gulani while I grind like I do\n'C-c-cause even when my daddy was on crack, I was cracked\nNow the whole album crack you ain't gotta skip a track\nI ain't gotta get a plaque, I ain't gotta get awards\nI just walk up out the door all the girls will applaud\nAll the girls will commend, as long as they understand\nThat I'm fighting for the girls, that never thought they could win\n'Cause before they could begin you told 'em it was the end\nBut I am here to reverse the curse that they live in\nGot two bones to pick, I'ma only choose one\nYou might get addressed on the second album\nWhich means you can breath, tell that motherfucker say so\nTo all my bad bitches, I can see your halo\n\nAh, it's OK\nIt's OK, long as you know\nLong as you know\nLong as you motherfuckers know\nI'm the best, best, best, best"}}, {"title": "I Just Borrow",

the Ramada\nCause on the road of life, she is the spokesmodel\nHer body tighter, than a coke bottle\nShe super charge cars, anything for Minaj\nAnd she could only park, in the superstar garage\nCause she-she-she-she bad, if anybody ask\nHer bags is boss, cause her leather so soft\nIf it ain't of been softer, tell 'em raise the offer\nUsed to fuck with a yellow bitch, named Porsche\nN-n-now it's me

me why is it\nNow you tell me why is it, don't need the Riker's visit\nThat is because, I'm about the color, of the Geico lizard\nShe L-Lewinsky, hold ya bosses-es\nCome around town, three hundred horses-es\nPower she devour, got them gettin' divorces-es\n(Sirens blaring)....I don't stop for officers\nAnd now we hit hydraulics, that's for the left turn\nNeed I repeat, she got more horses, than a Western\nYou know she beat weight, so she don't eat late\nA vegetarian, she sipping on that V-eight\nThey try to gas her, they try to put it in her\nYou can't pass her, she faster than a TV

afford her,  but -\nAll the boys stare, when she comes around my way\nStraight out the driveway, head to the highway\nRed light, green light, got the best moves\nHeadlights, beam bright, got the best boobs\nI call her double R (Range Rover), my rough rider\nWe hit a couple malls, then the Ramada\nCause on the road of life, she is the spokesmodel\nHer body tighter, than a coke bottle\nShe super charge cars, anything for Minaj\nAnd she could only park, in the superstar garage\nCause she-she-she-she bad, if anybody ask\nHer bags is boss, cause her leather so soft\nIf it ain't of been softer, tell 'em raise the offer\nUsed to fuck with a yellow bitch, named Porsche\nN-n-now it's me and her, she say it's you Minaj\nRed underneath her shoe, that's Louie Vuitton\n\nLa-la-la-la-la-la-la,

on the gas, 140 on the dash\nOn the dash, on the dash, on the d-d-d-d-ash\n\nShe's so dope, you know she even help me -\nTransport the dope, that mama stay around that -\nWhite, like the pope, they get the canine, but they -\nCan't smell the coke, now you tell me why is it\nNow you tell me why is it, don't need the Riker's visit\nThat is because, I'm about the color, of the Geico lizard\nShe L-Lewinsky, hold ya bosses-es\nCome around town, three hundred horses-es\nPower she devour, got them gettin' divorces-es\n(Sirens blaring)....I don't stop for officers\nAnd now we hit hydraulics, that's for the left turn\nNeed I repeat, she got more horses, than a Western\nYou know she beat weight, so she don't eat late\nA vegetarian, she sipping on that V-eight\nThey try to gas her, they try to put it in her\nYou can't pass her, she faster than a TV dinner\nHer lip gloss poppin', we call it Armor All\nWe chuck the deuces up, d-d-don't know all of y'all\n\nLa-la-la-la-la-la-la, (la-la-la)

really ain't me\nMondays was the fun days, from -\nThe slum to the runway, runs in the Hyundai\nNiggas didn't have your money, it was gun play\nUsed to tell me to listen, to what a thug say\nAt night, I would sleep on you\nAnd I guess I did sleep on you\nCause when they said it, I said \"Creep on who?\"\nNo, not myboo,ain't what he gon do\n\nOh now you wanna be with me\nBut you can't be with me\nBoy leave me alone\nYou know you did me wrong\nSo I gotta letcha go\nIf you wanted me in your life\nYou shoulda treated me right\nBoy leave me alone\nYou know you did me wrong\nSo I gotta letcha go\n\nWhy you saying you ain't feel her? You was in  -\nThe villa, she was in the white chinchilla\nYou was sippin' on a Miller, my bitch -\nPam' had the hidden cam, like Killa\nFunny how ya win some, ya lose some\nNever worry where your income, would come from\nCause no matter, where you was I held you down\nUp north, to uptown, so how you sound\nNow you all up in my face, 'bout you make mistakes\nIf I'da known you was fake, I'da laced your steak\nStrychnine, one time, in your Welch's Grape (wine)\nQuit lying, why you lying? I watched the tape, nigga\nNow get up out my dressing room, give me some f'ing room\nGo get your mind right, and take it as a lesson learned\nJust like Usher nigga, you gon' have to, let it burn\nTo the left, and I ain't talkin about Jigga girl\n\nOh now you wanna be with me\nBut you can't be with me\nBoy leave me alone\nYou know you did me wrong\nSo I gotta letcha go\nIf you wanted me in your

deal\nAnd I been waiting on you just to give me the word\nYou know, a couple nouns and a couple of verbs\nI do it for them girls that be flippin\u2019 the bird\nTryna get up out the hood and get into the \u2018burbs\nBut everything you said, was it just pretend?\nMaybe it was all a game like ESPN\nI don\u2019t really care if they hate on you\nI be turning down meetings just to wait on you\nBut what I don\u2019t understand is why you told them you signed me\nIf you wasn\u2019t ready to get totally behind me\nI mean honestly, how could you deny me?\nYou know you\u2019re Harry and I\u2019ll always be Hermione\n\nI\u2019ve been lonely, I\u2019ve been waiting for you\nI\u2019m pretending, and that\u2019s all I can do\nThe love I\u2019m sending ain\u2019t making it through to your heart\n\nDear Wayne, I\u2019m writing another letter cause\nYou never did respond, it\u2019s been a couple months\nSee when I speak I say what people wanna hear\nSo this will be the last thing that they gonna hear\nBut this will be the realest shit that I ever wrote\nYou see me falling, why you never sent down a rope?\nI woulda climbed up but now my times up\nI swear to God man, I thought you had it lined up\nBut if the Lord had a head of thorns\nWho am I but a broad with some metaphors\nKnockin\u2019 on a set of doors\nKnockin\u2019 on heaven's doors\nLet\u2019s play a game, just for pretend\nCould we play a game?\nLet's act like you coming to me\nLike you laced up your shoes, started running to me\nAnd you was running out of breath but you kept going\n\u2018Cause you finally realized what you slept on\nIf you take your own life are you a sinner?\nI made you dinner\nBut you better be a hell of a sprinter\nIf you\u2019re reading this letter, I done pulled the trigger\nI

really am proud of you\nSecond of all, I gotta say thanks\nYou really did alot for my out of state banks\nWith that being said, let's get down to the real\nI still don\u2019t understand what went down with the deal\nAnd I been waiting on you just to give me the word\nYou know, a couple nouns and a couple of verbs\nI do it for them girls that be flippin\u2019 the bird\nTryna get up out the hood and get into the \u2018burbs\nBut everything you said, was it just pretend?\nMaybe it was all a game like ESPN\nI don\u2019t really care if they hate on you\nI be turning down meetings just to wait on you\nBut what I don\u2019t understand is why you told them you signed me\nIf you wasn\u2019t ready to get totally behind me\nI mean honestly, how could you deny me?\nYou know you\u2019re Harry and I\u2019ll always be Hermione\n\nI\u2019ve been lonely, I\u2019ve been waiting for you\nI\u2019m pretending, and that\u2019s all I can do\nThe love I\u2019m sending ain\u2019t making it through to your heart\n\nDear Wayne, I\u2019m writing another letter cause\nYou never did respond, it\u2019s been a couple months\nSee when I speak I say what people wanna hear\nSo this will be the last thing that they gonna hear\nBut this will be the realest shit that I ever wrote\nYou see me falling, why you never sent down a rope?\nI woulda climbed up but now my times up\nI swear to God man, I thought you had it lined up\nBut if the Lord had a head of thorns\nWho am I but a broad with some metaphors\nKnockin\u2019 on a set of doors\nKnockin\u2019 on heaven's doors\nLet\u2019s play a game, just for pretend\nCould we play a game?\nLet's act like you coming to me\nLike you laced up your shoes, started running to me\nAnd you was running out of breath but you kept going\n\u2018Cause you finally realized what you slept on\nIf you take your own life are you a sinner?\nI made you dinner\nBut you better be a hell of a sprinter\nIf you\u2019re reading this letter, I done pulled the trigger\nI done pulled the trigger\nIf you\u2019re reading this letter, I done pulled the trigger"}}, {"title": "Lollipop (Remix)", "album": "Sucka Free", "year": null, "lyrics": "Shorty wanna li li li li lick

been a long time coming, but you don't know specifics\nNo more phony wishes, we ready, cause now we know the business\nCome holla at your guy, I always make it pour\nInvite me to ya wedding, I throw dollars at the bride\nIt's dirty money, dirty jeans, and dirty scullies\nYou heard he funny, but chill, I'm still absurdly gully\nMost of these rappers lost, it's no cash at all\nIf I knew this back

And where my stash at??\nI mean, where the Dow Jones, where the Nas-Daq?\nI do it for the little macs, with their caps back\nMy little niggas pumpin' crack, out they napsack\nKnow what I mean? Get the sticky cream, pass that\nI smoke bitches, can't nicotine patch that\nDon't need your spot, to get a good game\nCause a shot is a shot, if you got a good aim\n\nIt's been a long time coming, but I came\nNow everybody in the rap game know my name\nBut honey ain't a damn thing funny when your fame\nOutweighs your change, outweighs your change (x2)\n\nWe on the road to riches, I'm fucking loads of bitches\nI'm playing with you mama, Nicki, she's so suspicious\nMy little golden mistress, for her, I load them biscuits\nYeah I roll with Nicholas, we so explicit, you won't resist it\nIt's been a long time coming, but you don't know specifics\nNo more phony wishes, we ready, cause now we know the business\nCome holla at your guy, I always make it pour\nInvite me to ya wedding, I throw dollars at the bride\nIt's dirty money, dirty jeans, and dirty scullies\nYou heard he funny, but chill, I'm still absurdly gully\nMost of these rappers lost, it's no cash at all\nIf I knew this back then, I'da just played basketball\nOr maybe not, they say that I never pass the ball\nIf there's no cash involved, baby I'mma laugh it off"}}, {"title": "Lookin Ass (Lookin Ass Nigga)", "album": "Young Money: Rise Of An Empire", "year": "2014-03-11", "lyrics": "Look at y'all niggas...

could have a conversation\nTop five tax bracket in the population\nHatin' and I know they got a reason why\nI ain't got to wonder if I want to lease or buy\nAnd I dictate, how I'm gonna piece the pie\nI ain't talkin' about no muthafuckin' pizza pie\nCause I keep a bad bitch, booty big and the waist thin\nSeen his little weiner, but we don't like Nathans\nNah, homie you gon' need a bigger cock-pit\nCause when I fly, I be right behind the cockpit\n\nAye, yo captain, aye yo cap\nI-I don't wanna hear that navigation, big pa\nI'm tryin', I'm tryin' to get some sleep, ya dig?\n\nOh no, we

it's so sadistic\nI took a Learjet to cop some lipstick\nYeah I'mma risk it, I'm optimistic\nI sip on Ros\u00e9, you sip your Mystic\nMy flow's a 'biscuit, short of a picnic\nOkay, Versace Pythons,Louis aviators\nBalenciagas and they gotta be the gladiators\nChanel lambskin, vintage Vanson\nI'm on the bike, doin' wheelies in a mansion\nA lot of bad bitches, on the pole dancin'\nGucci

\"two sticks in my bun\"\nI mean that, when I put a bun in my hair\nLike, when I put my hair in a ponytail and I wrap my hair in a bun\nI put two Chinese sticks in my bun with the Chinese bang\n'Cause y'all, y'all minds is in the gutter\nThat's what two sticks in my bun mean, okay?\nBut Holiday, you already know, y'knahmsayin?\nThey heard that hard spittin', they heard that fast shit\nNow, you know, you gotta slow it down for them, you know?\nUm, they wanna hear me sing\nYou know, behind every bad bitch there's a really sweet girly girl\nThere's a really sweet Harajuku Barbie, and, um\nNow it's time for them to hear me get all nice and soft and moist\nI mean, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to say that\nI meant, this is the portion of the tape where\nI just wanna be more, you know, delicate and wet (splash)\nI'm, I'm, I'm so... I, I didn't mean to say that\nI meant that, you know, Holiday, just slow it down, daddy!"}}, {"title": "Nicki Minaj Speaks #3", "album": "Beam Me Up Scotty", "year": "2009-11-08", "lyrics": "Okay so

you\nEven though what you was doin\u2019 wasn\u2019t tasteful\nEven though you out here lookin\u2019 so ungrateful\nI'mma keep it movin\u2019 be classy and graceful\nI told 'em it\u2019s no friends in the game, you ain\u2019t learned that yet\nAll the bridges you came over, don\u2019t burn that yet\nNiggas want respect, but niggas ain't earned that yet\nSelf-righteous and entitled but they swearin' on the Bible\nThat they love you, when really they no different from all your rivals\nBut I still don\u2019t wish death on \u2018em, I just reflect on 'em\n\nPills n' potions\nWe're overdosin'\nI'm

you\nThey see you doin' good now, it\u2019s kinda hard to diss you\nNiggas be sick when they remember all the bad they wished you\nNiggas be mad when they can't come and live lavish with you\nBut I sped off in a Benzy, I see the envy, when I\u2019m causing a frenzy\nSo I pop pills for 'em, cop cribs in the hills, on \u2018em\n\nPills n' potions\nWe're overdosin'\nI'm angry but I still love

the N.I.C to K.I\nI'm Tinkerbell, he's Peter Pay-ai\nTo these rap bitches, I'm Mother May I\nI wanna know why you waste your ti- I'm\nOn these rap hoes, that don't write they rhy- I'm\nGet a can of Sprite, with a twist of lime\nMoney, money, money always on my mind\nCoupe color purple, no I'm not Celie (Sil-lay)\nWe run New York, like we play relay\nMy flight took off, yours has been delayed\nGive it to them early bitches, so don't be late\nPlaytime is over, when I spit bars\nMy mixtape, bring all the boys to the yard\nAll the boys want Nicki, all the boys want mine\nAll the boys say they love me, yeah, they love me long time\nYes, I'm the girl that they heard of,I commit murder\nI body bitches, I don't need a burner\nQueens, oh yes, I rep Queens\nLittle white tee, plus some tight jeans\nI make it hard for these chicks to breathe\nWrist on freeze, I freeze up my sleeves\nWe gettin' money, like it grow on trees\nStay on my Qs, I stay on my Ps\nAfter I'm done, then you will acknowledge\nI'm the president, never went to college\nI'm a bad bitch, I don't need no stylist\nTell a bitch, hollas when she get my dollas\nBitches talk shit, but what is you sayin'?\nGot the illest dude in the game, speakin my name\nI'm the one, I'm the one, you heard me?\nSame number they stiched on McGrady jersey\nIf I show you how to do it, will you reimburse me?\nLet me put on my pumps, let me grab my skirtsy\nI am such a little lady, let me do my curtsi\nFuck a dry pussy bitch, cause I know she thirsty", "image":

I actually get in arguments because people say Nicki doesn't rep New York. I say \"What do you mean? She shouts it out all of the time.\"\n\nY'all don't want me to rep y'all. Y'all don't hear when I rep y'all cause y'all be dick-riding everybody else.\n\nShe does have a point. Do you feel you get the proper love from New York?\n\nHell fucking no.\n\nAnd I never understood that because you ran the same circuits of all these other rappers. You did the DVDs. You did the mixtapes. You came up on mixtapes like every other underground rapper in New York.\n\nI was selling my mixtape out of my mutherfucking BMW out on Jamaica mutherfucking Avenue to Amadu and Hussaine and these niggas. Fuck you niggas! You niggas don't know the fucking half of what I've fucking been through!\n_________________________________________________________________\n\nWell, Sir Isaac Newton said the law of energy is, \"Energy is not lost or destroyed, it is merely transferred from on party to the next.\" You got a miserable bitch on a blog who writes something negative about you, you read it, and now you're miserable.\n\nAbsolutely. Right. Absolutely.\n\nWhat you think about the blogs, Scaff Beezy?\n\nHonestly, the blogs could just suck my damn cock, balls, deepthroat, gag, and choke.\n_________________________________________________________________\n\nSo, Miss Nicki Minaj, what do you say to people that say you're trying to be something that you're not like Lady Gaga or Madonna and you're doing things for shock value?\n\nWell, I mean, I don't know. In a minute, if I fucking sit down and piss, they're going to tell me I can't do that cause another bitch did it.\n\nStupid ass bitches! Yo, niggas just want to compare her to somebody.\n\nEverybody! If they ever see me sitting down and peeing, they're gonna fucking stone me.\n\nThey're gonna say, \"You're trying to be like Barack's wife. Look at her, she's sitting down and peeing like that. You trying to be like Michelle.\"\n\n\"Why you sitting down and peeing Nicki?\"\n\n\"Why don't you stand up?\"\n\nThat happens to everybody, though.\n\nIt does.\n\nNo, Nicki gets it so hard -- pause! Hospital flow, need more gauze.\n\nI think when they don't understand something they gotta compare it to something to make themselves feel comfortable.\n\nAbsolutely, I always say that. For their minds to interpret it, they have to draw a comparison. And I always say, even though it's very common, it's just a more simple-minded approach as opposed to looking at every situation as if it's the first time. It is what it is. But even she gets compared to Madonna, and it's a never-ending cycle. But I rather you compare me to someone that is winning and that's won than compare me to...\n\nSomeone that is washed. That's a natural emotion though... It's easy for a loser to be jealous of a winner. That's just the way that it is.\nDo you ever look back at some of your performances and look at your costumes and your wigs and say, \"I did look like a damn fool?\"\n\nYes! Yes, I do. Yes, I do.\n\nDo you ever think that?\n\nSometimes. Every now and then. You know what I like about superstars? I like my superstars to be out there. Jump out the window! Be like Prince with your ass out. I may see it and say, \"Damn, she looks like a fool,\" but you're a superstar.\nThat's how I want to see my superstars. I don't want to see my superstars regular.\n_________________________________________________________________\n\nI keep saying this: I went to school for theater. I took four years of my life and devoted it to theater.\nI did that because my passion was acting. When I started rapping, I felt like I couldn't really be myself. When I started winning, I started feeling that I can be myself. I can do my accents, I can do my voices, I can do my faces, I can do costumes.\nI can now bring me to who, you know, people see as Nicki Minaj. I can now really bring me into it. And I think that's where the confusion lies, is that people thought that when I first came out, that that was me in my entirety. But that wasn't. That was a small facet of who I was.\nBut, who you see now is just a more multi-faceted mixture of all the personalities that I have in me. I mean... and I think that if I was to not show that, then I wouldn't be doing justice to all the people that feel like I do. Cause for every person who doesn't understand it is, there is a person who feels like me, who feels like... sometimes I just break out in an English accent, you know, like, what's wrong with that?\n\nYou can! Why not?\n_________________________________________________________________\n\nDo you think that mixtape Nicki and pop Nicki can exist in the same space?\n\nThey already are. They're already existing together, and they are both winning.\n\nWho do you feel that you lean towards more?\n\nI can't choose. I can't pick. I feel like the world makes them two different people, but in my mind they're the same person.\nThat's what I keep saying... I grew up in New York my whole life. I would go to the block and hang out with my home girls on the weekend, and then Monday through Friday I was having a nine-to-five on Wall Street.\nWhen I was an office manager I wasn't having the same conversation in the office that I was having on the block, but I was still the same person. I was Onika. But I knew how to switch it up and have an intelligent conversation with one group of people, get a job, ace the interview, and then go home with my home girls and have fun.\n\nIt seems like you're very versatile. If it's one thing that I would love for little girls to embrace from Nicki Minaj is the fact that she is versatile. She knows how to kick it in the streets and she knows how to kick it in the corporate setting.\n\nRight, because you can't do too much of either. You really can't.\nIt's unfortunate that at times hip hop culture will tell you to lean only to one side, when that is detrimental for your future. It's detrimental for your growth. It's detrimental to your longevity.\nAt a certain point as a woman -- I'm not talking about as a man because we've seen The Blueprint with Jay. We've seen that you could come in the game and do 10, 12, 15 \u2013 still win and still be the king of hip hop. We have not seen that with a woman. So, show me the blueprint. That's all I want you to do -- show me the blueprint.\n\nI think you are creating it. Because Queen Latifah doesn't exist in that space anymore. She went on to become an actress.\n\nAnd is someone who I tip my hat to because Queen Latifah looked at it and said, \"Okay, wait, hmm, I may not want to be 40 years old rapping. The hip hop fans may not want to hear me when I'm 40 years old rapping. So I'm going to move in a way so that every aspect of who I am can be seen.\" Queen Latifah does musicals, movies, voice-overs for cartoons -- is she a sellout or is she winning?\n\nShe's winning!\n\nSo these other bitches that only did rap and now they're washed, and they're living in, you know, low income housing - is that winning? Just so that a nigga in the street can give me a fucking dap? The same niggas that didn't buy my album any fucking way, that downloaded the shit? Get the fuck out of here!\n_________________________________________________________________\n\nWhen it's all said and done, are you going to want to have kids? Get married?\n\nOh my goodness, I have to! I have to! Yep. I'm gonna get married and have kids. I love children. I am obsessed with children.\nAnd yeah, I believe in marriage, and I believe marriage is forever. So, that's the other thing...\n\n\"Look in my eyes, look in my eyes / Know that we'll always be forever / Moment in time, moment in time...\"\n\nSafaree... Safaree...\n_________________________________________________________________\n\nDo you have any regrets? Cause you've had a relatively short career. This is the second album, and hopefully we can ten more of these. But do you have any regrets in this short time that you've been Nicki Minaj?\n\nI think my only regret would be not enjoying every single moment when I could have.\n\nHow can the author of \"I wish I could enjoy this moment for life\" not be here trying to enjoy every moment?\n\nAbsolutely. And that's the thing. It kinda just comes so quickly.\n\nPause!\n\nAnd then all of a sudden it's like, \"Wait a minute. I just did Super Bowl. I just did Super Bowl with Madonna. And before I go into the Super Bowl stage I'm just stressing and worrying. And then when I come off it's all done. And what I did I even enjoy about it?\n\nNot even that, you closed up the Grammy's.\n\nBut that's why, cause she's doing the Super Bowl, and she's thinking about the Grammy's.\n\nAnd then I'm doing the Grammy's, and I'm thinking about the NBA all-star game. That's the only thing.\nI've gotten to a very good place, though. All of my friends and mentors in the game have been reaching out to me trying to encourage me because for some strange reason they knew how frazzled I used to be. And every time I tell people, \"No, no, I'm really good. I'm really happy. I'm really at a peaceful place.\" It's almost like they don't believe me. So I thought the other day, I must have really, really been worried a lot. Because people who know me very well are like, \"Are you sure you're ok?\" But I really am. I've never been this happy. I'm so proud of this album. I'm proud of myself. And I will not allow anyone to scare me out of my true potential. It's a scare tactic.\n_________________________________________________________________\n\nWhat is Nicki Minaj's purpose? Because from the outside looking in, I think you're a very blessed individual. Because you got two things going against you. Number one, you're a female. And the female hip hop division was not existent before you started popping. And then you're from New York. There's a lot of rappers from New York that aren't popping right now. So you got those two things going against you.\nBeing that you were able to break through that and be the big superstar that you are, it's like, \"She's obviously here for something.\" I think it's a bigger purpose than maybe you even know. But what is Nicki Minaj's purpose?\n\nI have to pray on that. I think that my purpose will eventually be related to some sort of movement for my younger fans, really... I've always had this dream of having a Nicki Minaj YMCA type of thing. When I was young -- well, everybody knows my story -- we didn't have a lot. Free lunch was the thing, \"We can get free lunch. Oh, we're going to free lunch. This is like dope!\" So I remember those moments and I always play them back in my head. And I wish to think to myself, I wish there was a place we could also go to to go swimming and to do this and to do that.\nBut things were moving so quickly. My parents were so, not really stable and just -- my father being an addict and all that. In a lot of ways I feel like I didn't really have a childhood. So when I see kids, it melts my heart because I'm looking at them and I'm like \"They'll never get this moment back again, and they'll always remember this time.\" How do we as adults optimize it for them right now, whether they have money or not.\nI think that one day I would like to do something for them, for kids in the inner cities, for them to have a place where they can go to and have not only recreation but schooling, tutoring. I remember I was really really smart in school, and I think my mother took that for granted. So she wouldn't really sit with me and take the extra time to give me that extra push. But I think that kids need that.\nIt's weird because people would never expect me to be so into children's education, but that's real shit. I don't just say that because it sounds good. I really am interested in learning how to build the education system to a point where we have more of a success rate in terms of black children that go from high school to college.\nI feel like college was not something that was engraved in my brain. I don't feel like that ever happened. Most of my closest girlfriends, it was just like once they got out of high school they figured, \"Oh well, we're good now, we're out of high school,\" or \"I got my GED, I'm good.\" And I don't want my fans to think like that.\nI have such a great rapport with my fans. When they see me, they really be bringing out their Bachelor's and their Master's saying, \"Look, Nicki, Look.\" Because they know how important it is to me. It's OK to have fun (I'mma give you the raunchiest verse sometimes), but I also want you to realize that it's for a time.\nOne day, you're going to look back and think \"Wait a minute, did I really lose my life clubbing and miss out on a moment where I could've been building myself as a woman and having something to offer my children?\"\nWe got so many girls right now having children and don't even know the first thing to say to a child. But you're having a child because I want to keep this dude or it just happened. I want to get us to the place where it doesn't just happen and that we're smarter than that. We're the ones in control again. Why are we never in control?\nWhy are we stuck with a baby? Why are we always stuck on the welfare line? Why are we always stuck having to beg, borrow, and steal to provide for our children? Why do we think it's something wrong for waiting to have a baby? Waiting until you're 35 or 36 to have children?\nTechnology has changed \u2013 you can wait! Have something to offer them. That's something that's dear to my heart, doing something that makes children feel like \"I don't have to rush to grow up. I can enjoy my childhood. I can have somewhere to go for free for recreational purposes and for schooling purposes.\" That's my bigger goal in life.\n\nHow do you stay humble? I know you keep a tight circle, you keep guys like Scaff Beezy around.\nI'm gonna ask Scaff. How do you keep her humble, Scaff Beezy? Do you ever see her getting a little bit extra...?\n\nYou wanna know what's crazy? Yesterday, remember I was saying to you, \"It's so crazy. She's so famous.\" If she goes out, anytime we go somewhere, it's such a freaking chaotic zoo movie.\nThe other day we went to a carnival. We thought we'd be able to be in there, and just go on some rides, and nobody will notice anything. Within like seven minutes the whole park -- it was 10, 15 minutes until we got out.\nShe really hasn't changed. She really don't act like, \"I'm this person\" or, \"I'm that person.\" She just be there looking so oblivious to what's going on. Sometimes she doesn't even know she's famous like that. It doesn't faze her. She really hasn't changed a bit.\n_________________________________________________________________\n\nPay attention to that. How did you escape being more than just an ass?\n\nWe said that the other day, before I was just a rapping butt.\n\nA butt with lyrics\n\nHow did you get out of that?\n\nBecause I created a brand.\nPeople take for granted how hard it is so shout out to every woman and man that's won. It's very hard, mentally, this shit is draining and draining. For you to be able to get up there and do music that people love, and do interviews with a smile on your face, and act like this shit ain't getting to you, it's draining.\nIt's crazy! That's why so many artists go on drugs or become alcoholics. When I was coming up, I never understood it. I use to be like, \"What? They are so ungrateful. Why are they on drugs? Why don't they fucking appreciate their success? I would kill to be where they are,\" until you get here and you are like, \"Oh my god! Lord, is this the price I have to pay if I really want this?\" And he's like, \"Yep. Now let's see who really want it.\" But, I think I became more than that because people cannot deny... at the end of the day, people can't deny that...\n\nYou the shit. Say it! You don't have to be humble. Be like Ray J. \"I'm tired of being humble.\"\n\nI'm not a cocky person by nature.\n\nScaff, be cocky for her!\n\nYeah, yeah, yeah, man. You bitches ain't shit, man. You need to just really -- When you see her, get the rose petals, just like she's said before, throw it out in front of her feet. You pour out the champagne. You feed her grapes. If something needs to be sucked, you suck it!\n\nWhat!? What would need to be sucked? On you?\n\nAy. Anything. Anywhere. I'm in these streets looking for work. We're all in these streets, we're looking for that work, that twerk.\n_________________________________________________________________\n\nI just want to tell you, Nicki, I think that you're very necessary. I think you represent something way bigger than hip hop. I think that you're gonna take hip hop to new levels. And I think, like how Jay-Z took it to heights and made people be like, \"Damn, hip hop can take you this far!?\" I think you're taking that baton and you're gonna take it even further. So keep doing your thing, Ma.\n\nThank you, darling.\nCharlemange da God, singed out!", "image": "https://images.genius.com/bc436c4e6a770ffcfa1e9efe79c60cd5.1000x1000x1.jpg", "artist": "Nicki Minaj", "raw": {"annotation_count": 52, "api_path": "/songs/212823", "description": {"dom": {"tag": "root", "children": [{"tag": "p", "children": ["This is the very last track in the Deluxe edition of Nicki Minaj\u2019s ", {"tag": "em", "children": ["Pink Friday: Roman Reloaded"]}, " studio album, and it only appears on the digital version.

I actually get in arguments because people say Nicki doesn't rep New York. I say \"What do you mean? She shouts it out all of the time.\"\n\nY'all don't want me to rep y'all. Y'all don't hear when I rep y'all cause y'all be dick-riding everybody else.\n\nShe does have a point. Do you feel you get the proper love from New York?\n\nHell fucking no.\n\nAnd I never understood that because you ran the same circuits of all these other rappers. You did the DVDs. You did the mixtapes. You came up on mixtapes like every other underground rapper in New York.\n\nI was selling my mixtape out of my mutherfucking BMW out on Jamaica mutherfucking Avenue to Amadu and Hussaine and these niggas. Fuck you niggas! You niggas don't know the fucking half of what I've fucking been through!\n_________________________________________________________________\n\nWell, Sir Isaac Newton said the law of energy is, \"Energy is not lost or destroyed, it is merely transferred from on party to the next.\" You got a miserable bitch on a blog who writes something negative about you, you read it, and now you're miserable.\n\nAbsolutely. Right. Absolutely.\n\nWhat you think about the blogs, Scaff Beezy?\n\nHonestly, the blogs could just suck my damn cock, balls, deepthroat, gag, and choke.\n_________________________________________________________________\n\nSo, Miss Nicki Minaj, what do you say to people that say you're trying to be something that you're not like Lady Gaga or Madonna and you're doing things for shock value?\n\nWell, I mean, I don't know. In a minute, if I fucking sit down and piss, they're going to tell me I can't do that cause another bitch did it.\n\nStupid ass bitches! Yo, niggas just want to compare her to somebody.\n\nEverybody! If they ever see me sitting down and peeing, they're gonna fucking stone me.\n\nThey're gonna say, \"You're trying to be like Barack's wife. Look at her, she's sitting down and peeing like that. You trying to be like Michelle.\"\n\n\"Why you sitting down and peeing Nicki?\"\n\n\"Why don't you stand up?\"\n\nThat happens to everybody, though.\n\nIt does.\n\nNo, Nicki gets it so hard -- pause! Hospital flow, need more gauze.\n\nI think when they don't understand something they gotta compare it to something to make themselves feel comfortable.\n\nAbsolutely, I always say that. For their minds to interpret it, they have to draw a comparison. And I always say, even though it's very common, it's just a more simple-minded approach as opposed to looking at every situation as if it's the first time. It is what it is. But even she gets compared to Madonna, and it's a never-ending cycle. But I rather you compare me to someone that is winning and that's won than compare me to...\n\nSomeone that is washed. That's a natural emotion though... It's easy for a loser to be jealous of a winner. That's just the way that it is.\nDo you ever look back at some of your performances and look at your costumes and your wigs and say, \"I did look like a damn fool?\"\n\nYes! Yes, I do. Yes, I do.\n\nDo you ever think that?\n\nSometimes. Every now and then. You know what I like about superstars? I like my superstars to be out there. Jump out the window! Be like Prince with your ass out. I may see it and say, \"Damn, she looks like a fool,\" but you're a superstar.\nThat's how I want to see my superstars. I don't want to see my superstars regular.\n_________________________________________________________________\n\nI keep saying this: I went to school for theater. I took four years of my life and devoted it to theater.\nI did that because my passion was acting. When I started rapping, I felt like I couldn't really be myself. When I started winning, I started feeling that I can be myself. I can do my accents, I can do my voices, I can do my faces, I can do costumes.\nI can now bring me to who, you know, people see as Nicki Minaj. I can now really bring me into it. And I think that's where the confusion lies, is that people thought that when I first came out, that that was me in my entirety. But that wasn't. That was a small facet of who I was.\nBut, who you see now is just a more multi-faceted mixture of all the personalities that I have in me. I mean... and I think that if I was to not show that, then I wouldn't be doing justice to all the people that feel like I do. Cause for every person who doesn't understand it is, there is a person who feels like me, who feels like... sometimes I just break out in an English accent, you know, like, what's wrong with that?\n\nYou can! Why not?\n_________________________________________________________________\n\nDo you think that mixtape Nicki and pop Nicki can exist in the same space?\n\nThey already are. They're already existing together, and they are both winning.\n\nWho do you feel that you lean towards more?\n\nI can't choose. I can't pick. I feel like the world makes them two different people, but in my mind they're the same person.\nThat's what I keep saying... I grew up in New York my whole life. I would go to the block and hang out with my home girls on the weekend, and then Monday through Friday I was having a nine-to-five on Wall Street.\nWhen I was an office manager I wasn't having the same conversation in the office that I was having on the block, but I was still the same person. I was Onika. But I knew how to switch it up and have an intelligent conversation with one group of people, get a job, ace the interview, and then go home with my home girls and have fun.\n\nIt seems like you're very versatile. If it's one thing that I would love for little girls to embrace from Nicki Minaj is the fact that she is versatile. She knows how to kick it in the streets and she knows how to kick it in the corporate setting.\n\nRight, because you can't do too much of either. You really can't.\nIt's unfortunate that at times hip hop culture will tell you to lean only to one side, when that is detrimental for your future. It's detrimental for your growth. It's detrimental to your longevity.\nAt a certain point as a woman -- I'm not talking about as a man because we've seen The Blueprint with Jay. We've seen that you could come in the game and do 10, 12, 15 \u2013 still win and still be the king of hip hop. We have not seen that with a woman. So, show me the blueprint. That's all I want you to do -- show me the blueprint.\n\nI think you are creating it. Because Queen Latifah doesn't exist in that space anymore. She went on to become an actress.\n\nAnd is someone who I tip my hat to because Queen Latifah looked at it and said, \"Okay, wait, hmm, I may not want to be 40 years old rapping. The hip hop fans may not want to hear me when I'm 40 years old rapping. So I'm going to move in a way so that every aspect of who I am can be seen.\" Queen Latifah does musicals, movies, voice-overs for cartoons -- is she a sellout or is she winning?\n\nShe's winning!\n\nSo these other bitches that only did rap and now they're washed, and they're living in, you know, low income housing - is that winning? Just so that a nigga in the street can give me a fucking dap? The same niggas that didn't buy my album any fucking way, that downloaded the shit? Get the fuck out of here!\n_________________________________________________________________\n\nWhen it's all said and done, are you going to want to have kids? Get married?\n\nOh my goodness, I have to! I have to! Yep. I'm gonna get married and have kids. I love children. I am obsessed with children.\nAnd yeah, I believe in marriage, and I believe marriage is forever. So, that's the other thing...\n\n\"Look in my eyes, look in my eyes / Know that we'll always be forever / Moment in time, moment in time...\"\n\nSafaree... Safaree...\n_________________________________________________________________\n\nDo you have any regrets? Cause you've had a relatively short career. This is the second album, and hopefully we can ten more of these. But do you have any regrets in this short time that you've been Nicki Minaj?\n\nI think my only regret would be not enjoying every single moment when I could have.\n\nHow can the author of \"I wish I could enjoy this moment for life\" not be here trying to enjoy every moment?\n\nAbsolutely. And that's the thing. It kinda just comes so quickly.\n\nPause!\n\nAnd then all of a sudden it's like, \"Wait a minute. I just did Super Bowl. I just did Super Bowl with Madonna. And before I go into the Super Bowl stage I'm just stressing and worrying. And then when I come off it's all done. And what I did I even enjoy about it?\n\nNot even that, you closed up the Grammy's.\n\nBut that's why, cause she's doing the Super Bowl, and she's thinking about the Grammy's.\n\nAnd then I'm doing the Grammy's, and I'm thinking about the NBA all-star game. That's the only thing.\nI've gotten to a very good place, though. All of my friends and mentors in the game have been reaching out to me trying to encourage me because for some strange reason they knew how frazzled I used to be. And every time I tell people, \"No, no, I'm really good. I'm really happy. I'm really at a peaceful place.\" It's almost like they don't believe me. So I thought the other day, I must have really, really been worried a lot. Because people who know me very well are like, \"Are you sure you're ok?\" But I really am. I've never been this happy. I'm so proud of this album. I'm proud of myself. And I will not allow anyone to scare me out of my true potential. It's a scare tactic.\n_________________________________________________________________\n\nWhat is Nicki Minaj's purpose? Because from the outside looking in, I think you're a very blessed individual. Because you got two things going against you. Number one, you're a female. And the female hip hop division was not existent before you started popping. And then you're from New York. There's a lot of rappers from New York that aren't popping right now. So you got those two things going against you.\nBeing that you were able to break through that and be the big superstar that you are, it's like, \"She's obviously here for something.\" I think it's a bigger purpose than maybe you even know. But what is Nicki Minaj's purpose?\n\nI have to pray on that. I think that my purpose will eventually be related to some sort of movement for my younger fans, really... I've always had this dream of having a Nicki Minaj YMCA type of thing. When I was young -- well, everybody knows my story -- we didn't have a lot. Free lunch was the thing, \"We can get free lunch. Oh, we're going to free lunch. This is like dope!\" So I remember those moments and I always play them back in my head. And I wish to think to myself, I wish there was a place we could also go to to go swimming and to do this and to do that.\nBut things were moving so quickly. My parents were so, not really stable and just -- my father being an addict and all that. In a lot of ways I feel like I didn't really have a childhood. So when I see kids, it melts my heart because I'm looking at them and I'm like \"They'll never get this moment back again, and they'll always remember this time.\" How do we as adults optimize it for them right now, whether they have money or not.\nI think that one day I would like to do something for them, for kids in the inner cities, for them to have a place where they can go to and have not only recreation but schooling, tutoring. I remember I was really really smart in school, and I think my mother took that for granted. So she wouldn't really sit with me and take the extra time to give me that extra push. But I think that kids need that.\nIt's weird because people would never expect me to be so into children's education, but that's real shit. I don't just say that because it sounds good. I really am interested in learning how to build the education system to a point where we have more of a success rate in terms of black children that go from high school to college.\nI feel like college was not something that was engraved in my brain. I don't feel like that ever happened. Most of my closest girlfriends, it was just like once they got out of high school they figured, \"Oh well, we're good now, we're out of high school,\" or \"I got my GED, I'm good.\" And I don't want my fans to think like that.\nI have such a great rapport with my fans. When they see me, they really be bringing out their Bachelor's and their Master's saying, \"Look, Nicki, Look.\" Because they know how important it is to me. It's OK to have fun (I'mma give you the raunchiest verse sometimes), but I also want you to realize that it's for a time.\nOne day, you're going to look back and think \"Wait a minute, did I really lose my life clubbing and miss out on a moment where I could've been building myself as a woman and having something to offer my children?\"\nWe got so many girls right now having children and don't even know the first thing to say to a child. But you're having a child because I want to keep this dude or it just happened. I want to get us to the place where it doesn't just happen and that we're smarter than that. We're the ones in control again. Why are we never in control?\nWhy are we stuck with a baby? Why are we always stuck on the welfare line? Why are we always stuck having to beg, borrow, and steal to provide for our children? Why do we think it's something wrong for waiting to have a baby? Waiting until you're 35 or 36 to have children?\nTechnology has changed \u2013 you can wait! Have something to offer them. That's something that's dear to my heart, doing something that makes children feel like \"I don't have to rush to grow up. I can enjoy my childhood. I can have somewhere to go for free for recreational purposes and for schooling purposes.\" That's my bigger goal in life.\n\nHow do you stay humble? I know you keep a tight circle, you keep guys like Scaff Beezy around.\nI'm gonna ask Scaff. How do you keep her humble, Scaff Beezy? Do you ever see her getting a little bit extra...?\n\nYou wanna know what's crazy? Yesterday, remember I was saying to you, \"It's so crazy. She's so famous.\" If she goes out, anytime we go somewhere, it's such a freaking chaotic zoo movie.\nThe other day we went to a carnival. We thought we'd be able to be in there, and just go on some rides, and nobody will notice anything. Within like seven minutes the whole park -- it was 10, 15 minutes until we got out.\nShe really hasn't changed. She really don't act like, \"I'm this person\" or, \"I'm that person.\" She just be there looking so oblivious to what's going on. Sometimes she doesn't even know she's famous like that. It doesn't faze her. She really hasn't changed a bit.\n_________________________________________________________________\n\nPay attention to that. How did you escape being more than just an ass?\n\nWe said that the other day, before I was just a rapping butt.\n\nA butt with lyrics\n\nHow did you get out of that?\n\nBecause I created a brand.\nPeople take for granted how hard it is so shout out to every woman and man that's won. It's very hard, mentally, this shit is draining and draining. For you to be able to get up there and do music that people love, and do interviews with a smile on your face, and act like this shit ain't getting to you, it's draining.\nIt's crazy! That's why so many artists go on drugs or become alcoholics. When I was coming up, I never understood it. I use to be like, \"What? They are so ungrateful. Why are they on drugs? Why don't they fucking appreciate their success? I would kill to be where they are,\" until you get here and you are like, \"Oh my god! Lord, is this the price I have to pay if I really want this?\" And he's like, \"Yep. Now let's see who really want it.\" But, I think I became more than that because people cannot deny... at the end of the day, people can't deny that...\n\nYou the shit. Say it! You don't have to be humble. Be like Ray J. \"I'm tired of being humble.\"\n\nI'm not a cocky person by nature.\n\nScaff, be cocky for her!\n\nYeah, yeah, yeah, man. You bitches ain't shit, man. You need to just really -- When you see her, get the rose petals, just like she's said before, throw it out in front of her feet. You pour out the champagne. You feed her grapes. If something needs to be sucked, you suck it!\n\nWhat!? What would need to be sucked? On you?\n\nAy. Anything. Anywhere. I'm in these streets looking for work. We're all in these streets, we're looking for that work, that twerk.\n_________________________________________________________________\n\nI just want to tell you, Nicki, I think that you're very necessary. I think you represent something way bigger than hip hop. I think that you're gonna take hip hop to new levels. And I think, like how Jay-Z took it to heights and made people be like, \"Damn, hip hop can take you this far!?\" I think you're taking that baton and you're gonna take it even further. So keep doing your thing, Ma.\n\nThank you, darling.\nCharlemange da God, singed out!"}}, {"title": "Put It On Ya", "album": "Unreleased", "year": null, "lyrics": "\u2018Cause I get wetter than

leave and never come back\nI don't control you, I ain't never say that\nCan't give up on you, baby, we go way back\n\nPut you in a room\nYou ain't gotta leave\nYou ain't gotta leave\nBut you can't

hope for you\nBut all you do is open wounds\nI could be fucking with them other niggas\nAnd no you ain't them other niggas\nI don't fuck with a lot of bitches\nJust my real bitches\nWhy you keep talking about it, you keep talking and you gon' get me pissed off\nMotherfuckers who be wanting that bitch to go crazy if she could cut her wrist off\nI ain't finna lie, no I ain't finna lie like it was just his fault\nBut I know if a nigga lose me, then nigga, oohwee, that's his loss, young nigga\n\nPut you in a room\nYou ain't gotta leave\nYou ain't gotta leave\nBut you can't sleep with me\nPut

like, \"Please, boy\"\nYou just need to leave, boy\nI ain't got time for you\nJust once, do somethin' for me, boy\n\nRegret in your tears, know you taste 'em\n'Cause you know I don't chase, I replace 'em\nDon't rush, take time, take some\nI just wanted memories, tried to make some with you\nYou\nNow I gotta erase some with you\nYou\n\nTried to make some with you, you\nWith you, you\nI tried to make some with you\nI tried to make some with you\nI tried to make some with you\nI tried to make some with you\nI tried to make some with you, baby\nMake some with you\nTwo pickney, mi woulda make some with you\nYou said you would save me\nYou said you would save me\nHahahaha, rrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr\nOhhhh, woooh", "image":

memories, tried to make some with you\nYou\nNow I gotta erase some with you\nYou\n\nLook at you now, stuck in the background\nSilence right now sounds so loud\nTried to let you go, you come back 'round\nLook at you now, stuck in the background\nTwo seats in my two seater-er-er\nUsed to pull off on me, leave me hur-urt\nTryna front, but I know you do your dir-irt\nNot nice, boy you know you do your dirt\n\nRegret in your tears, know you taste 'em\n'Cause you know I don't chase, I replace 'em\nDon't rush, take time, take some\nI just wanted memories, tried to make some with you\nYou\nNow I gotta erase some with you\nYou\n\nBaby now you know you got nerve\nI know you just wanna be heard\nI'm a bad bitch, you ain't used to that\nYou gon' fuck around and make me do you bad\nUsed to creep, creep, with you through the back\nI count up the cash and bring you the bag\nI count up the racks like Serena\nPlus I got that ass like Selena\nAnd you know nah-nah-nah-nah-nah, not a bitch\nThat's gon' care, care, hold you down and love you like this\nDrop down, turn around, baby show you like this\nWon't find another one to ride it like a soldier like this\n\nRegret in your tears, know you taste 'em\n'Cause you know I don't chase, I replace 'em\nDon't rush, take time, take some\nI just wanted memories, tried to make some with you\nYou\nNow I gotta erase some with you\nYou\n\nYeah, and they say big girls don't cry\nBaby I cried\nThe real ones don't lie\nBaby you lied\nI don't know what to do with you\nBaby now I'm through with you\n\n'Cause you don't even know what you just lost\nYou don't even know what you just had\nYou don't even know, and that's what's bad\nMoney bag long, that bitch bad\nUsed to lay up in them sheets, they were snow white\nNow you spendin' cold nights\nYou've been in the wrong so long\nYou don't even know right\nCall my line, call my line, I'm like, \"Please, boy\"\nYou just need to leave, boy\nI ain't got time for you\nJust once, do somethin' for me, boy\n\nRegret in your tears, know you taste 'em\n'Cause you know I don't chase, I replace 'em\nDon't rush, take time, take some\nI just wanted memories, tried to make some with you\nYou\nNow I gotta erase some with you\nYou\n\nTried to make some with you, you\nWith you, you\nI tried to make some with you\nI tried to make some with you\nI tried to make some with you\nI tried to make some with you\nI tried to make some with you, baby\nMake some with you\nTwo pickney, mi woulda make some with you\nYou said you would save me\nYou said you would save me\nHahahaha,

null, "lyrics": "Before I begin, I would like to note that I am not a \"Barb\" \u2013 that\u2019s not to be taken as a negative statement, but rather to let you, the reader, know that my opinions aren\u2019t biased\nWith that out of the way, I am someone who extremely respects the accelerated rise of a superstar - and not just someone who tops the Billboard Hot 100 with one or two songs to later fade into non-relevance\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, I'm all about artists having their \"moment\" - but creating that moment, while still a pretty monumental task, is the easy part. What's hard is sustaining that rapid ascendance to the top\nTo become a mainstay in the music industry, it takes multiple hit songs, impressive live performances, educated sit-down interviews, and an extremely hard work ethic to create a superstar. It also requires you to earn the respect of your fellow peers \u2013 because, let\u2019s face it, how can someone be labeled a \u201csuperstar\u201d without having earned the respect from fans, the media, and even other artists?\nAnd while it\u2019s not often that a new superstar emerges, if I had one word to describe Nicki Minaj and her meteoric rise to fame, it would be just that \u2013 superstar\nWe all know the backstory \u2013 Nicki was born in Trinidad, moved to New York City as a child with her family, had a rough childhood as her father, attended LaGuardia High School (not because of her rapping, but acting), and was eventually signed to Lil Wayne\u2019s Young Money label\nDuring the lengthy bidding war for Nicki Minaj, which involved various record labels, Lil Wayne had hopes that she would eventually sign with him and become the \u201cFirst Lady of Young Money\u201d.

No longer was she confined to creating singles for urban radio, but she was now a bonafide-hit across all genres\nNow, with a staggering net worth of over $50 million, Nicki has proven that she can hang with any male rapper in the game bar-to-bar, create radio-friendly and chart-topping hits that rival those of pop\u2019s biggest acts, and attract the attention of huge brand names like Coke, Pepsi, MAC, and Adidas for multi-million dollar endorsement deals\nIf that\u2019s not the power of a superstar, then I don\u2019t know what is", "image": "https://images.genius.com/78ad75a66ac07fe7597bc66e8437afcb.996x1000x1.jpg", "artist": "Nicki Minaj", "raw": {"annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/1400480", "description": {"dom": {"tag": "root", "children": [{"tag": "p", "children": ["?"]}]}}, "embed_content": "<div id='rg_embed_link_1400480' class='rg_embed_link' data-song-id='1400480'>Read <a href='https://genius.com/Nicki-minaj-rise-of-a-superstar-part-1-nicki-minaj-lyrics'>\u201cRise of a Superstar (Part 1) -

spazzin'\nSo fuck I look like gettin' back to a has-been?\nYeah, I said it, has-been\nHang it up; flatscreen\nPlasma\n\"Hey Nicki, hey Nicki,\" asthma\nI got the pumps, it ain't got medicine\nI got bars; sentencin'\nI'm a bad bitch, I'm a cunt\nAnd I'll kick that ho; punt\nForced trauma; blunt\nYou play the back, bitch, I'm in the front\nYou need a job, this ain't cuttin' it\nNicki Minaj is who you ain't fuckin' with\nYou lil' brag-a-lot, I beat you with a pad-a-lock\nI am a movie; camera block\nYou outta work, I know it's tough\nBut enough is enough\n\nRaah, raah, like a dungeon dragon\nRaah, raah, raah, like a dungeon dragon\nRaah, raah, raah, like a dungeon dragon\nLike a dungeon dragon, like a dungeon dragon\n\nI ain't into S&M, but my whip's off the chain\nA little drop of candy paint drips off the frame\nTwisted-ass mind, got a pretzel for a brain\nAn eraser for a head, fuckin' pencil for a frame\nYou don't like it, then peel off, bitch!\nEvery last woman on Earth I'll kill off\nAnd I still wouldn't fuck you, slut!\nSo wipe the smile on your grill off\nI swear to God I'll piss a Happy Meal off\nGet the wheels turning, spin, and wheel off\nSnap the axle in half, bust the tie-rod\nQuit hollering \"Why, God?\"\nHe ain't got shit to do with it\nBygones'll never be bygones\nThe world ain\u2019t finished swallowing my wad\nI ain't finished blowing it, nice bra\nHope it'll fit a tough titty, bitch, life's hard\nI swear to God, life is a dumb blonde white broad\nWith fake tits and a bad dye job\nWho just spit in my fuckin' face and called me a fuckin' tightwad\nSo finally I broke down and bought her an iPod\nAnd caught her stealing my music\nSo I tied her arms and legs to the bed\nSet up the camera and pissed twice on her\nLook, two pees and a tripod!\nThe moral to the story is, life's treating you like dry sod?\nKick it back in its face, my God\nIt's Shady and Nicki Minaj, you might find the sight quite odd\nBut don't ask why, bitch (Ask \"Why not?\")\n\nThe world-world is my punching bag and\nIf I'm garbage, you're a bunch of maggots\nMake that face, go on, scrunch it up at me\nShow me the target so I can lunge and attack it\nLike a raah, raah, like a dungeon dragon\nYou fell off, off, they musta bumped your wagon\nYou musta went off the back, I'm 'bout to go off the deep end\nI told you to stay in your lane, you just jumped in traffic\n\nIs this the thanks that I get for puttin' you bitches on?\nIs it my fault that all of you bitches gone?\nShoulda sent a thank-you note, you little ho\nNow I'ma wrap your coffin with a bow\n\"Nicki, she's just mad 'cause you took the spot\"\nWord, that bitch mad 'cause I took the spot?\nWell, bitch, if you ain't shittin', then get off the pot\nGot some niggas out in Brooklyn that'll off your top\nI hear them mumblin', I hear the cacklin'\nI got 'em scared, shook, panickin'\nOverseas, church, Vatican\nYou at a standstill; mannequin\nYou wanna sleep on me? Overnight?\nI'm the motherfuckin' boss, overwrite\nAnd when I pull up, vroom, motorbike\nNow all my niggas gettin' buck; overbite\nI see them dusty-ass Filas, Levi's\nRaggedy Ann, holes in your knee-highs\nI call the play, now do you see why?\nThese bitches callin' me Manning Eli\nManning Eli, these bitches callin' me Manning Eli!!\n\nAll you lil' faggots can suck it\nNo homo, but I'ma stick it to 'em like refrigerator magnets\nAnd I'm crooked enough to make straitjackets bend\nYeah, look who's back again, bitch, keep acting as if\nYou had the same passion that I have, yeah, right\nStill hungry, my ass, you ass-dicks had gastric bypass\nAin't hot enough to set fire to dry grass\nAnd 'bout as violent as hair on eyelids but eyelash\nGo take a flying leap of faith off a fuckin' balcony\n'Fore I shove a falcon wing up your fly ass\nYou know what time it is, so why ask?\nWhen Shady and Nicki's worlds clash\nIt's (high class) meets (white trash)\n\nRaah, raah, like a dungeon dragon\nRaah, raah, raah, like a dungeon dragon\nRaah, raah, raah, like a dungeon dragon\nLike a dungeon dragon, like a dungeon dragon\n\nRoman, Roman!

anywhere\n(Crazy)\n\nYo let's do it up in Disney in the Magic Kingdom\nYou can tug on my giuseppes in my badgly mischka\nI'm a b b b, I'm a bag of fun\nI'm a pro with them balls like And 1\nNow lets go, Mexico? That's where we next to go\nDo it like his mama, make him eat his vegetables\nCall me a stage mom, boy you best a blow\nOr you can even call me Wanda, 'cause I'm red to go\nYou know I'm spoiled lil' daddy, stomps the floor\nWe can do it in 5th ave in the department store\nWe can do it in Tokyo we do it in Taiwan\nAll my Harajuku girls say I am they icon\n\nDon't compare me to your ex mane\nBaby he a local joker\nI'll take you to six flags\nAnd drill you on the roller coaster\nCall your girlfriends over we can have a sleepover\nBuy yo ass a jeep, so I can fuck you in the range rover\nPictures of her nude, On a cruise We gone make the news\nSex scrait, sex tape, ready for a YouTube\nDamn it turn me on, when we do it in your mama home\nFather long gone but Gucci can be your daddy baby\nI can fly you anywhere, We can sex and crazy places\nAirport,Train station, going up the elevator\nAt the dome, on the 50, I'm gon' throw it, you the center\nWhen you hike it, I'm a spike it\nGirl don't act like you don't like it\n\nHow bad you wanna do me, on a scale of 1 to 10\nYou like the way I bend now you askin' where I been\nIf I'm doing him, Now you starting that again\nI don't want to sex your friend, He don't got enough to lend\nPlus he was doing Lynn, and she ain't nothing like amazing\nHer stuff run deep, and he don't have a occupation\nI'm known across the nation, Trina's that chick\nBow leg, red bone, long hair, real thick\nDo me at my mama house, nah I don't think so\nI go too much class but you can try to San Pedro\nI need the biggest mansion, ocean back yard\nWith the newest Maybach, and inside a black card"}}, {"title": "Sex in the Lounge", "album": "Pink Friday: Roman Reloaded", "year": "2012-04-02", "lyrics": "DJ, turn me up\nDon't you turn this down, no no\n\nI

you know we gotta switch\nMy house so big that bitch came with a lobby\nWe didn't use a rubber, but I came on her body\nI lay her down and kiss her neck and talk dirty to her\nLike I get that pussy wetter than a dirty sewer\nFuck with me, turn around and bust it open for me\nGet on that dick and get that money, go Oprah for me\nAll you girls don't like me, cause they know you love me\nBut if you

the street is that I'm chinese\nNo lil mama I'm just high off haze\nDon't fuck a dude if a dude don't pay\nDon't suck a dude if a dude dirty\nWhen it come to you gotta look purty\nSit up in the booth get your weave curly, hey\nSim simma\nPass me the keys to my beemer\nWish I had a booty like Trina\nNigga get your green up\nStay in the sky like Nina\nFlights to Japan, Tiran and Korea\n x2\n\nI

me\n?\nI am the one, like Tracy McGrady\nNow little daddy let me, let me upgrade ya\nCome on, I make it hot, see I'm a hot one\nI keep the stack & let Max play the shotgun\nI'm in the good car, always with a hood star\nIntroducing Mr. & Mrs. Good Bar\n\nGet up on my level niggas, get it up\nGettin Dirty Money figures, throw it up\nGet up on my level bitches, get it up\nDrink some Dirty Money bitches, get a cup\nX2\n\nIt's frego daddy, grade V of coarse\nGod Willing coming soon, I'm the good of New York\nI shine like VVS stones in the dark\nTake a seat, when you here me like Rosa Parks\nFuck the chit chat\nLet's talk guns & drugs, you with that?\nTryin' to see a mill or two, fuck who I'm better than\nRollin up on a dutch, you know I need my medicine\nIt's high noon & I'm the nigga that shot the sheriff\nMe & Nicki's like Bonnie & Clyde, don't be embarrassed\nI'm sort of like a rabbit the way I love my cabbage\nBut I Still watch for 5-0 like I'm Garret\n08\u2032 Challenger lookin' like Dukes of Hazzard\nTurn it into a coupe, and now the roofs gone\nWord to Nicki Minaj with daisy dukes on\nSee it's Max-a-millie-on, chumps so move on\nBefore I act like a auto-bot and transform\nToo Hot & I ain't Mims\nI flip bricks while you little clown still buyin' rims\nWho's in charge, stop frontin' like I ain't him\nI'm Saks Fifth Ave, you still shop at Fims\nSuperstar with the Audemar and a pair of Tims\nWho your wives screwing?

always spending all their money on love\nThe Boys always spending all their money on love\nThey wanna touch it, taste it, see it, feel it, bone it, own it\nDollar, dollar, paper chase it get that money\n\nYou get high, fuck a bunch of girls\nAnd then cry on top of the world\nI hope you have the time of your life\nI hope I don't lose it tonight\n\nBald head pussy got lots of juice\nLopsided on the curb so I block the coupes\nWatch the deuce\nMan I'm stingy with my kitty cat daddy\n\"Did you ever really love me Steebie?\"\nRrrrrrr, pull up in the rrrrrrr\nWrist on burrrrr, pussy on purrrr-purrrr\nI don't even brake when I'm backing up\nI'll swerve on a nigga if he acting up\nI done pushed more sixes than a play date\nGet money by the millions, fuck a day rate nigga\n\nYour

Do you need someone?\nIs it too late to talk? Did I wait too long?\nThousand words don't change a thing\nIs it only three? Three words that you're missing?\n\nWhere did you go? Couldn't see\nI was too busy\nCould've just said no\nWhere would you go? I think that I know\n\nO-o-o-o-o-o, O-o-o-o-o-o\nWe're back to playing, we're back to playing\nO-o-o-o-o-o, O-o-o-o-o-o\nWe're back to playing, the crying game\n (x2)\nI could've given everything\nDon't wanna let the tears begin\nWe're back to playing, the crying game\n\nWelcome to the crying game, where you lose your soul\nWhere it ain't no E-Z Pass, you got to use the toll\nAin't no cruise control, you 'bout to lose control\nAin't no smilin' faces here, we slammin' doors and dishes\nSayin' we don't miss each other, but it's all fictitious\nSayin' that we had enough, but enough of what?\nAnother slap to the face, another uppercut\nI'm just abusive by nature, not cause I hate ya\nNot cause I wanna get someone to imitate ya\nI know it's hard, I know I intimidate ya\nBut is you stayin' or goin'?\nI couldn't breathe, and you ain't even know it\nHow come you never show it? All this love you speak of\nAll I want, is to love and be loved (to love and be loved)\n\nI'm losin' a thing I thought I'd win\nAnd I'm coming undone, cause the tears don't end\n\nWhere did you go?

laced with drugs\nYou ain't play your cards right, you had the Ace of Clubs\nHit you with the Ace of Spade, in your face, and shrugged\nBlood drippin' out your arm on my Asian rugs\nWe was just planning a wedding, Caucasian doves\nYou was just tellin' your mans, that you hate the clubs\nNow we in the crying game, heart laced with slugs\n\nAre you alone? Do you need someone?\nIs it too late to talk? Did I wait too long?\nThousand words don't change a thing\nIs it only three? Three words that you're missing?\n\nWhere did you go? Couldn't see\nI was too busy\nCould've just said no\nWhere would you go? I think that I know\n\nO-o-o-o-o-o, O-o-o-o-o-o\nWe're back to playing, we're back to playing\nO-o-o-o-o-o, O-o-o-o-o-o\nWe're back to playing, the crying game\n (x2)\nI could've given everything\nDon't wanna let the tears begin\nWe're back to playing, the crying game\n\nWelcome to the crying game, where you lose your soul\nWhere it ain't no E-Z Pass, you got to use the toll\nAin't no cruise control, you 'bout to lose control\nAin't no smilin' faces here, we slammin' doors and dishes\nSayin' we don't miss each other, but it's all fictitious\nSayin' that we had enough, but enough of what?\nAnother slap to the face, another uppercut\nI'm just abusive by nature, not cause I hate ya\nNot cause I wanna get someone to imitate ya\nI know it's hard, I know I intimidate ya\nBut is you stayin' or goin'?\nI couldn't breathe, and you ain't even know it\nHow come you never show it? All this love you speak of\nAll I want, is to love and be loved (to love and be loved)\n\nI'm losin' a thing I thought I'd win\nAnd I'm coming undone, cause the tears don't end\n\nWhere did you go? Couldn't see\nI was too busy\nCould've just said no\nWhere would you go? I think that I know\n\nO-o-o-o-o-o, O-o-o-o-o-o\nWe're back to playing, we're back to playing\nO-o-o-o-o-o, O-o-o-o-o-o\nWe're back to playing, the crying game\n (x2)\nI could've given

world\n\nThis is for the little girls that say Nicki you pretty\nWhen you come to the city you don't act high siddity\nYou be up on the block, posted up in the drop\nAnd everybody get up in, whether you like it or not\nBut how them girls blow up but don\u2019t come to the hood?\nHow they turn they nose up like they don\u2019t come from the hood?\nMost of them be in sight til it\u2019s time to pitch in\nThat's why everything they write be a contradiction\nI tell em I do it for the love, I do it for the hugs\nI do it for the buzz, I do it for the thugs\nI do it for the rich, I do it for the poor\nI do it for the kid that can\u2019t do no more\n\nI remember standing in the mirror\nSearching for a winner, but I didn\u2019t see it in her\nNow I\u2019ve gone from a zero to a

homies that be asking for kisses\nWhen I\u2019m granting they wishes they be passing they digits\nThey be up on the block getting screwed by the cops\nCutting school, gettin knocked whether they like it or not\nThey\u2019ll break in your door\nMight break in your jaw\nThey\u2019ll bring back a lot\nIf you bring them an O\nBut what you really ain\u2019t know\nThey airborne for stardom\nWith the ball in the Garden, stand tall, no dodgin\u2019\nNo matter the squadron, lieutenant or sergeant\nAir Force, the Army, Air Force and Army\nFatigues is on him, no heats is on him\nCause grandmama prayed, that he\u2019d leave the corner\n\nI remember standing in the mirror\nSearching for a winner, but I didn\u2019t see it in her\nNow I\u2019ve gone from a zero to a super-hero-oh-oh\nWoah, woah\nChasing dreams, got me all over the world\nNow I\u2019m sitting on top of the world\nWe winning, we winning\nCause we sitting on top of the world\n\nI remember when I lost everything in a fire\nNow I got fire 23\u2032s on my tire\nShout outs to my brothers, Jelani and Macaiah\nThanks to the Messiah, my money getting higher\nOne time for my niggas, that be huggin\u2019 the block\nTwo Times for my niggas, that be ducking the cops\nThree Times for my girls that pushing they own rides\nStushing they own ride, bitches they don't lie\nSometimes you get mad, wanna blaze the gun\nLook, I see you without a man ma, you raised ya son\nWell look, when you blow up everybody go shudder\nThis goes out to everybody on the come up\n\nI remember standing in the mirror\nSearching for a winner,

sitting on top of the world\n\nThis is for the little girls that say Nicki you pretty\nWhen you come to the city you don't act high siddity\nYou be up on the block, posted up in the drop\nAnd everybody get up in, whether you like it or not\nBut how them girls blow up but don\u2019t come to the hood?\nHow they turn they nose up like they don\u2019t come from the hood?\nMost of them be in sight til it\u2019s time to pitch in\nThat's why everything they write be a contradiction\nI tell em I do it for the love, I do it for the hugs\nI do it for the buzz, I do it for the thugs\nI do it for the rich, I do it for the poor\nI do it for the kid that can\u2019t do no more\n\nI remember standing in the mirror\nSearching for a winner, but I didn\u2019t see it in her\nNow I\u2019ve gone from a zero to a super-hero-oh-oh\nWoah, woah\nChasing dreams got me all over the world\nNow I\u2019m sitting on top of the world\nWe winning, we winning\nCause we sitting on top of the world\n\nThis is for my little homies that be asking for kisses\nWhen I\u2019m granting they wishes they be passing they digits\nThey be up on the block getting screwed by the cops\nCutting school, gettin knocked whether they like it or not\nThey\u2019ll break in your door\nMight break in your jaw\nThey\u2019ll bring back a lot\nIf you bring them an O\nBut what you really ain\u2019t know\nThey airborne for stardom\nWith the ball in the Garden, stand tall, no dodgin\u2019\nNo matter the squadron, lieutenant or sergeant\nAir Force, the Army, Air Force and Army\nFatigues is on him, no heats is on him\nCause grandmama prayed, that he\u2019d leave the corner\n\nI remember standing in the mirror\nSearching for a winner, but I didn\u2019t see it in her\nNow I\u2019ve gone from a zero to a super-hero-oh-oh\nWoah, woah\nChasing dreams, got me all over the world\nNow I\u2019m sitting on top of the world\nWe winning, we winning\nCause we sitting on top of the world\n\nI remember when I lost everything in a fire\nNow I got fire 23\u2032s on my tire\nShout outs to my brothers, Jelani and Macaiah\nThanks to the Messiah, my money getting higher\nOne time for my niggas, that be huggin\u2019 the block\nTwo Times for my niggas, that be ducking the cops\nThree Times for my girls that pushing they own rides\nStushing they own ride, bitches they don't lie\nSometimes you get mad, wanna blaze the gun\nLook, I see you without a man ma, you raised ya son\nWell look, when you blow up everybody go shudder\nThis goes out to everybody on the come up\n\nI remember standing in the mirror\nSearching for a winner, but I didn\u2019t see it in her\nNow I\u2019ve gone from a zero to a super-hero-oh-oh\nWoah, woah\nChasing dreams, got me all over the world\nNow I\u2019m sitting on

Are you here right now, huh?\nWe should all disappear right now\nLook, you're gettin' all your friends and you're gettin' in the car\nAnd you're comin' to the house, are we clear right now, huh?\nYou see the fleet of all the new things\nCop cars with the loose change\nAll white like I move things\nNiggas see me rollin' and they mood change\nLike a muhfucka\nNew flow, I got a dozen of 'em\nI don't trust you, you a undercover\nI could probably make some step-sisters fuck each other (woo)\nTalkin' filets with the truffle butter\nFresh sheets and towels, man she gotta love it\nYeah, they all get what they desire from it\nWhat, tell them niggas we ain't hidin' from it\n\nYo, thinkin' out loud\nI must have about a milli on me right now\nAnd I ain't talkin' about that Lil Wayne record\nI'm still the highest sellin' female rapper, for the record\nMan, this a 65 million single sold\nI ain't gotta compete with a single soul\nI'm good with the ballpoint game, finger roll\nAsk me how to do it, I don't tell a single soul\nPretty women, wassup? Is you here right now?\nYou a stand-up or is you in your chair right now?\nUhh, do you hear me? I can't let a wack nigga get near me\nI might kiss the baddest bitch if you dare me\nI ain't never need a man to take care of me\nYo, I'm in that big boy, bitches can't rent this\nI floss everyday, but I ain't a dentist\nYour whole style and approach, I invented\nAnd I ain't takin' that back, cause I meant it\n\nUh, thinkin' out loud\nI could be broke and keep a million dollar smile\nLOL to the bank, check in my account\nBank teller flirtin' after checkin' my account\nPretty ladies, are you here?\nTruffle butter on your pussy\nCuddle buddies on the low\nYou ain't gotta tell your friend\nThat I eat it in the morning\nCause she gonna say \"I know\"\nCan I hit it in the bathroom?\nPut your hands on the toilet\nI'll put one leg on the tub\nGirl, this my new dance move\nI just don't know what to call it\nBut bitch you dancing with the stars\nI ain't nothin' like your last dude\nWhat's his name? \u2014 Not important\nI brought some cocaine if you snortin'\nShe became a vacuum\nPut it on my dick like carpet\nSuck the white off white chocolate\nI'm so heartless, thoughtless\nLawless, and flawless\nSmallest, regardless\nLargest in charge\nAnd born in New Orleans\nGet killed for Jordans\nSkateboard, I'm gnarly\nDrake, Tunechi, and Barbie\nYou know!"}}, {"title": "Up All Night", "album": null, "year": null, "lyrics": "Kush rolled, glass full, I prefer the better things\nNiggas

her\nI got that kind of money, make a broke bitch bitter\nI got that kind of, wait wait, fixate\nWhich bitch you know made a million off a mixtape\nThat was just a keepsake, bought the president the louis\nPresidental briefcase, never been the cheapskate\nWe got the hawks, I ain't talkin' bout the peach state\nMaann for peeps sake, scratch that, sweepstakes\nFuck I look like ho, I look like yes and you look like no\nIma bad bitch, I ain't never been a mixed breed\nOn a diet, but im doing donuts in a 6speed\nM6 in front of M2, I see alot of rap bitches on the menu\nBut I collect a hunnit thou at the venue\nAnd pop bottles with my team, Young Money till the death of me\n\nI mean we can't even rock them shoes if it dont got a comma on the pricetag\nYou know, I mean but then again, who looks at the pricetag you know"}}, {"title": "Up In Flames", "album": "Pink Friday: Roman Reloaded - The Re-Up", "year": "2012-11-19", "lyrics": "We are going up in flames\nOne more night for us to burn brighter\nWe are going up in flames\nOne last time for us to go higher\nWe are going up in flames\nOne more night for us to burn brighter\nWe are going up in flames\nOne last time for us to go higher\n\nAnyway, lil' nigga don't test the kid\nEven Maury Povich couldn't test the kid\nEven R. Kelly couldn't touch the kid\nAnd even with all your bars you couldn't text the kid\nI got a pool that I never even swam in\nAirports that you bitches never land in\nThey be like, \"What you doing, Nicki?\" Branding\nSuck a cockpit, prepare for landing\nI'm brandin', I ain't talking about Priestley\nI keep a sniper, I ain't talking about Wesley\nWhy these bitches so pressed, B?\nOpen my trunk, all I gotta do is press B\nI'mma violate y'all asses like Chris Stokes\nI'm in Saint-Tropez, on a big boat\nGo my way to make a billi like a big goat\nPull my dick out case you bitches get a slick throat\n\nWe are going up in flames\nOne more night for us to burn brighter\nWe are going up in flames\nOne last time for us to go higher\nWe are going up in flames\nOne more night for us to burn brighter\nWe are going up in flames\nOne last time for us to go higher\n\nWant another round? Well then get the ref!\nGot the clothing line popping, and the wigs is next\nWhen I fly you know G5 is the jet\nI'm the motherfuckin' Queen, 'lizabeth\nMeetings with the president of every network\nThat is what the fuck I call how to network\nMy net worth, that net works\nKeep my shooters out in Brooklyn where the Nets work\nChillin' with executives\nCheck the charts, all my winnings are consecutive\nTrillion dollar deficit\nBut y'all don't hear me though, all you bitches deaf as shit\nBitches ain't got punchlines or flow\nI have both and an empire also\nSell out shows out in Norway, Oslo\nThis is the Re-Up better cop it while the cost low\nFlow's sick, I'll slap a patient\nI'm checking these bitches like an application\nCause these bitches tripping, no navigation\nSo it's off with your head, decapitation\nSend 'em up in flames like a fireman\nI do the hiring and I do the firing\nThat boss shit that you talk, I live it\nAnd I'm calling a travel if you don't stay on your pivot\nBitches\n\nWe are going up in flames\nOne more night for us to burn brighter\nWe are going up in flames\nOne last time for us to go higher\nWe are going up in flames\nOne more night for us to burn brighter\nWe are going up in flames\nOne last time for us to go higher", "image": "https://images.genius.com/a3f55e44fb953288920138f4408206b1.1000x1000x1.jpg", "artist": "Nicki Minaj", "raw":

Kelly couldn't touch the kid\nAnd even with all your bars you couldn't text the kid\nI got a pool that I never even swam in\nAirports that you bitches never land in\nThey be like, \"What you doing, Nicki?\" Branding\nSuck a cockpit, prepare for landing\nI'm brandin', I ain't talking about Priestley\nI keep a sniper, I ain't talking about Wesley\nWhy these bitches so pressed, B?\nOpen my trunk, all I gotta do is press B\nI'mma violate y'all asses like Chris Stokes\nI'm in Saint-Tropez, on a big boat\nGo my way to make a billi like a big goat\nPull my dick out case you bitches get a slick throat\n\nWe are going up in flames\nOne more night for us to burn brighter\nWe are going up in flames\nOne last time for us to go higher\nWe are going up in flames\nOne more night for us to burn brighter\nWe are going up in flames\nOne last time for us to go higher\n\nWant another round? Well then get the ref!\nGot the clothing line popping, and the wigs is next\nWhen I fly you know G5 is the jet\nI'm the motherfuckin' Queen, 'lizabeth\nMeetings with the president of every network\nThat is what the fuck I call how to network\nMy net worth, that net works\nKeep my shooters out in Brooklyn where the Nets work\nChillin' with executives\nCheck the charts, all my winnings are consecutive\nTrillion dollar deficit\nBut y'all don't hear me though, all you bitches deaf as shit\nBitches ain't got punchlines or flow\nI have both and an empire also\nSell out shows out in Norway, Oslo\nThis is the Re-Up better cop it while the cost low\nFlow's sick, I'll slap a patient\nI'm checking these bitches like an application\nCause these bitches tripping, no navigation\nSo it's off with your head, decapitation\nSend 'em up in flames like a fireman\nI do the hiring and I do the firing\nThat boss shit that you talk, I live it\nAnd I'm calling a travel if you don't stay on your pivot\nBitches\n\nWe are going up in flames\nOne more night for us to burn brighter\nWe are going up in flames\nOne last time for us to go higher\nWe are going up in flames\nOne more night for us to burn brighter\nWe are going up in flames\nOne last time for us to go higher"}}, {"title": "Va Va Voom", "album": "Pink Friday: Roman Reloaded", "year": "2012-10-23", "lyrics": "Just met a boy, Just met a boy when\nHe can come inside of my playpen\nCause he look like a superstar in the making\nSo I think that I'm going in for the taking\nHear through the grapevine that he's cakin'\nWe can shoot a movie he can do the tapin'\nBoom boom pow, this thing be shakin'\nI ain't even tryna find out who he datin'\n\nCause I know he got a wife at home\nBut I need just one night alone\nIf he keep playin them g-g-games\nI'mma run away (ay) I'mma run away (ay ay)\nI-I-I wanna give you one last option\nI-I-I wanna give you one last chance\nIf-If you looking for the main attraction\nJust hold on tight and let me do my dance\nIf you want it I'm gonna be va va voom voom\nIf you got it you got it you got that boom boom\nIf you want it I'm gonna be va va voom voom\nIf you got it you got it you got that boom boom\n\nJust met a boy, Just met a boy when\nHe can become my little problem\nCause it look like he modeling clothes in Dublin\nSo I think he that getting that green, a goblin\nHear through the grapevine that he hang low\nWe can shoot a movie, we can bang like Rambo\nBoom boom pow, this thing so bingo\nWondering if he can understand my lingo\n\nCause I know he got a wife at home\nBut I need just one night alone\nIf he keep playin them g-g-games\nI'mma run away (ay) I'mma run away (ay ay)\nI-I-I wanna give you one last option\nI-I-I wanna give you one last chance\nIf-If you looking for the main attraction\nJust hold on tight and let me do my dance\n\nBoy, I'm in this club slow-mo, don't mind if I do\nAnd I can tell you feeling me from the jump, I wanna ride too\nYou got that hot shit, boy, you blessed, let me feel up on your chest\nFlex it, you the man, you the man, one-hundred grand\nThe same old game blow, yes, I play it very well\nCome baby, lay it down, let me stay down\nLet me show you how I run things in my playground\nCome and get this va va voom voom (woo woo)\n\nCause I know he got a wife at home\nBut I need just one night alone\nIf he keep playin them g-g-games\nI'mma run away (ay) I'mma run away (ay ay)\nI-I-I wanna give you one last option\nI-I-I wanna give you one last chance\nIf-If you looking for the main attraction\nJust hold on tight and let me do my dance", "image": "https://images.rapgenius.com/688183644f79d2292f042ddf70b99a0b.600x600x1.jpg", "artist": "Nicki Minaj", "raw": {"annotation_count": 7, "api_path": "/songs/69350", "description": {"dom": {"tag": "root", "children": [{"tag": "p", "children": ["\u201cVa Va Voom\u201d is a bonus cut from ", {"tag": "em", "children": ["Pink Friday: Roman Reloaded"]}, ".

from the jump, I wanna ride too\nYou got that hot shit, boy, you blessed, let me feel up on your chest\nFlex it, you the man, you the man, one-hundred grand\nThe same old game blow, yes, I play it very well\nCome baby, lay it down, let me stay down\nLet me show you how I run things in my playground\nCome and get this va va voom voom (woo woo)\n\nCause I know he got a wife at home\nBut I need

the pizzeria\n\nI didn't say them\nThey schooled me to some bitch that you knew from back when\nSome bitch named Kim\nLight skinned, slim, used to rock a low brim\nFollowed them to the crib, but the lights real dim\nThey hit me on the chirp, warning me, now I'm warning you\nWhat's it gonna be Nicki, tell me what you wanna do\n\nDamn, I'mma have to send her to her maker\nDamn, I'mma have to send

all about my green nahmean?\nGot some fat bitches in the kitchen\nI got a spot like ox and we cook oxtail\nGot a scale for what's in the mail\nI got whatever on my nigga bail, But if the nigga bail\nI'll have him sleeping with some killer whales\nDamn bitches wanna fuck with my man\nOn the other hand, things ain't always what you plan\nIt's the ones up in your prom picture, salon wit'cha\nNow they wanna creep in your man's jeep\nI bet you Nicki won't sleep\nCause I'mma put the heat to your beak, You'll bird like tweet tweet\nAnd watch you smoke like a cigarette\nShould've left

right\nIt's my girl Kandi from out in Miami\nTelling me that my man with some bitch in a Camry\nCar seat in the back like he started a family\nYo Kan, stop playing, what the fuck is you saying?\n\nRemember them chicks from the Bricks 'round nine six\nThat we seen when we hit a lick by the project?\n\nOh, you mean Leah, little sister Maria\nI used to go see her in front of the pizzeria\n\nI didn't say them\nThey schooled me to some bitch that you knew from back when\nSome bitch named Kim\nLight skinned, slim, used to rock a low brim\nFollowed them to the crib, but the lights real dim\nThey hit me on the chirp, warning me, now I'm warning you\nWhat's it gonna be Nicki, tell me what you wanna do\n\nDamn, I'mma have to send her to her maker\nDamn, I'mma have to send her to her maker\nDamn, I'mma have to send her to her maker\nI'mma send her to her maker\nI'mma send her to her maker\n\nThey heard about his good sexing, long erections\nNice complexion, Magnums for protection\nThey even heard about his tongue game\nHow the nigga give brain, ain't stop 'til the cum came\nBut that's words of Hip Hop\nI popped the bitch top, like a Corona\n\nCall a coroner, it's gonna be a lot of black dresses and chest vest-es\nIf I find out he got a next Mrs\nWhat you think all the goons is for\nTwo by the door, a few more out in New York\nAnd I feed 'em curry chicken, I'm all about my green nahmean?\nGot some fat bitches in the kitchen\nI got a spot like ox and we cook oxtail\nGot a scale for what's in the mail\nI got whatever on my nigga bail, But if the nigga bail\nI'll have him sleeping with some killer whales\nDamn bitches wanna fuck with my man\nOn the other hand, things ain't always what you plan\nIt's the ones up in your prom picture, salon wit'cha\nNow they wanna creep in your man's jeep\nI bet you Nicki won't sleep\nCause I'mma put the heat to your beak, You'll bird like tweet tweet\nAnd watch you smoke like a cigarette\nShould've left the bitch a pack of Nicorette\nLeave all them foul bitches wet\nI give a fuck about you and your bum crew\nMami I'm the truth, they salute when I come through\nI'm not running bitch, I bust my gun, hold on I hear somebody coming"}}, {"title": "Wave Ya Hand", "album": "Pink Friday", "year": "2011-02-23", "lyrics": "Wave ya hand if you look good\nThrow some shade if you look good\nWave ya hand if
