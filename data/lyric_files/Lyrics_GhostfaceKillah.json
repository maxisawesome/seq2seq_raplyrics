pair of headphones\nUsed to play the 280 party rec rooms\nNow I play the big spots all in the city\nSpread champagne, scopin out bitties\nPick one, thick one son with small titties\nIt really doesn't matter as long as she's pretty\nCome here mami, dancin right beside me\nTommy Hilfiger cut, skin like Halle\nShe looked like she get it from her momma (momma)\nThat's right Michelle, I'm Obama (bama)\nOr maybe she get it from Madonna (donna)\n+Material Girl+ I still don ya (don ya)\nJe-wels is for the girl if she do well\nKnew she was dangerous, she rode me up too well\nHer jelly roll shakin like she into the well\nShe wanna put my name on her new nails\n - repeat 2X\n\nYo, yo\nAiyyo I roll on bitches, like a skateboard\nGot a few friends that give they cake to whores\nMe that's a no-no, Starks take control of a chick\nThen I go deep like Tony Romo\nKick 'em right out and the day starts over\nWhere I don't stop drinkin and I can't stand sober\nIn the morning when I wake up I get up just to ill\nTD Bank is what I do with the mills\nBracelets, Cuban neck is on chill\nPolar bear ice, I stay dressed to kill\nI found my thrill on Blueberry Hill\nHittin the haze, now I'm on stilts\nI'm too high, stuggle like Precious (Precious)\nLove doctor niggas get the message\nWhen it comes to baggin a chick, don't be impressive\nI get girls, y'all fellas is desperate\n - repeat 2X\n\nYeah\nYeah, yo\nYo son tap that girl, excuse me miss\nYou gangster~! Far from a bougie chick\nLove the way you talk, your jeans fit nice\nStill a lil' hood in you, you just my type\nGo 'head swallow that Nuvo, no disrespect\nYou front on me tonight I'mma bag me a new ho\nSpank that ass like a real papichulo\nThat Jimmy Neutron will sit you right on your culo\n - repeat 2X\n\nThat's right sexy lady\nCome and have a seat baby\nCome get a taste of this Patron and Nuvo\nThis that Jimmy Neutron baby\nYour lipstick lookin all good put your lips on this baby\nCome sip on this, aight?\nCheck it out, let's go"}}, {"title": "36 Seasons Album art & tracklisting", "album": "36 Seasons", "year": "2014-12-09", "lyrics": "Standard:\n\n\n\n\n\nTracklist:\n1.

nigga\n You know how I do...\n Sound about to go in on some real Wu shit, uh huh\n W-T-C\n That's right\n Ya know what I mean?\n GHOST-FACE KILLAH!\n Lemme give y'all the bullshit hook for y'all niggas\nCheck it out...\n\nThe burners and the stash, we 'bout the cash\nWe got females that got it like that\nThe golden childs that bone the crowd\nSee, niggas in the place that bit my style\nWell, I'm a singer, dancer, we bulletproof brothers\nWu-Tang got the answer\nCause if I had a chance to do it again\nI will still keep the heat in my pants-uh\n\nY'all be nice to the crackheads, everybody listen up\nI shot one of my bitches, the ho ain't trick enough\nWord life to big screen Don, tapping dustbones out\nWith starwriters like I fucked Celine Dion\nStuck everything that's the god's honest beyond\nWe airin' niggas out, that's the type shit that we on\nOfficial Wu-Tang headbanger\nFlood your space with big waves like you did in Sri Lanka\n\nI drink heavy gallons of cru, play the big part\nNiggas got squid on the grill, selling kids Clarks\nFinesse notes, yo, the Guess on with the vest pose\nYellow swede one matching hat with the grey gun\nNiggas be rhymin' for nothing, then my team pull up\nWe all throw down y'all broke niggas stay frontin'\nLines come digital stupid, plus ain't got no jewelry on\nBet I'm still live and I'm coopin'\nTwo of my silverbacks run through a pack of your wolves\nFront on react, we're sippin' Cognac  relax dude\nKnow I'm with these cracks dude\n\nYo, 1-2, Dirt McGirt\nSolid tone smith with 6th shots, lick shots\nLeave your head like a Shaolin monk with 6 dots\nBrooklyn Zoo, Zoo\nBrooklyn Zoo\n\nIt's the return of Bin Laden, grab your armor\nSmash pretty boy niggas, crush their karma\nEat bones with alligators, roll deep with my entourage\nMy whole crew's fresh out the bars\nDiggler AKA the Cab Driver\nDrop him off in the middle of fire\nDirty Island, drag bodies to the Murderland\nKnock niggas out hurtin' my hand\n\nI remember in the elevator we was playin' corners\nNow we play the corners and the cops is stayin' on us\nStaten's where the war is\nWhere the court system's running out of warrants\nWhere TNT be jumping out the Taurus\nFor real I can't call it\nYou see I love Lucy cause she Lawless\nExactly like that 1-0-3-0-4 is\nSnitch niggas swallow your tongue\nAlready know the island I'm from\nAnd y'all don't want no problems with them\n\nWe got a history full of lightning victories\nConceptual breakthrough, it ain't no mystery\nLong vision from giants in every way\nRap czars, magnificent flows for every day\nFrom the East to the 'ville, from the West to the hills\nIncredible rhymes, encouraging skills\nFrom rat packs, the smallest crews were enormous\nWe hit 'em fast with an effortless performance\nMCs start fleeing in flocks\nEspecially those that's more sensitive to heat and shock\n\nWe grindin' down to the bone, my name grounded in stone\nI'm Mr. Violence we loungin' with chrome\nMr. Violence we lounge in his home, hit the housing on Rome\nShining like a hundred thousand in stones\nMove mountains with poems, got a jones for dinero\n1-6-zero my songs we throwin' elbows\nThe hoes cling, sho thing, we know kings\nOnly dime dikes with minds right, we choose Queens\n\nYeah, we wild like rockstars who smash guitars\nYo, son, split his face with the toast, he ain't ghost\nIt's no joke iron coat rifle with the stroke\nOne toke brains float, shot to the throat\nBefore the smoke hit, witness the killing, chilling crime scene\nBody on the block, eyes open from the shock\nOf being popped in the neck\nYet he still held a lit cigarette between his fingers\nDanger when you step into the chamber with the Masta\nDisaster, gotta blast ya cause I have to\n\nThe rat pack is back from the island of Stat'\nLeave you cursed dust, cause you worship the Gat\nThe first one to snap drunk off the Smirnoff\nBlow the bouncer's ear off, let him floss he the boss\nHandcuffed, to the turntables like Wizard Theodore\nSee it's pure, let it rain pearly ounces\nBang him with the thing that hang from the trousers\nYou don't want no drama, I'm flaming fast\nThat nigga jumped up and did the Damon Dash", "image": "https://images.genius.com/61b48fa7fe972c473dc1c20c9489e45f.1000x1000x1.jpg", "artist": "Ghostface Killah", "raw": {"annotation_count": 29,

2, (Killa Beez) turn it up\nThe headphones, turn it up.. yo you hear me?\n Whattup Tony?\n Wassup don-don?\n All the way up...\n You know how we do...\n Let's get this paper together...\n You motherfuckin' right Pa, uh huh\n What's up, y'all?\n We wanna do it nigga\n You know how I do...\n Sound about to go in on some real Wu shit, uh huh\n W-T-C\n That's right\n Ya know what I mean?\n GHOST-FACE KILLAH!\n Lemme give y'all the bullshit hook for y'all niggas\nCheck it out...\n\nThe burners and the stash, we 'bout the cash\nWe got females that got it like that\nThe golden childs that bone the crowd\nSee, niggas in the place that bit my style\nWell, I'm a singer, dancer, we bulletproof brothers\nWu-Tang got the answer\nCause if I had a chance to do it again\nI will still keep the heat in my pants-uh\n\nY'all be nice to the crackheads, everybody listen up\nI shot one of my bitches, the ho ain't trick enough\nWord life to big screen Don, tapping dustbones out\nWith starwriters like I fucked Celine Dion\nStuck everything that's the god's honest beyond\nWe airin' niggas out, that's the type shit that we on\nOfficial Wu-Tang headbanger\nFlood your space with big waves like you did in Sri Lanka\n\nI drink heavy gallons of cru, play the big part\nNiggas got squid on the grill, selling kids Clarks\nFinesse notes, yo, the Guess on with the vest pose\nYellow swede one matching hat with the grey gun\nNiggas be rhymin' for nothing, then my team pull up\nWe all throw down y'all broke niggas stay frontin'\nLines come digital stupid, plus ain't got no jewelry on\nBet I'm still live and I'm coopin'\nTwo of my silverbacks run through a pack of your wolves\nFront on react, we're sippin' Cognac  relax dude\nKnow I'm with these cracks dude\n\nYo, 1-2, Dirt McGirt\nSolid tone smith with 6th shots, lick shots\nLeave your head like a Shaolin monk with 6 dots\nBrooklyn Zoo, Zoo\nBrooklyn Zoo\n\nIt's the return of Bin Laden, grab your armor\nSmash pretty boy niggas, crush their karma\nEat bones with alligators, roll deep with my entourage\nMy whole crew's fresh out the bars\nDiggler AKA the Cab Driver\nDrop him off in the middle of fire\nDirty Island, drag bodies to the Murderland\nKnock niggas out hurtin' my hand\n\nI remember in the elevator we was playin' corners\nNow we play the corners and the cops is stayin' on us\nStaten's where the war is\nWhere the court system's running out of warrants\nWhere TNT be jumping out the Taurus\nFor real I can't call it\nYou see I love Lucy cause she Lawless\nExactly like that 1-0-3-0-4 is\nSnitch niggas swallow your tongue\nAlready know the island I'm from\nAnd y'all don't want no problems with them\n\nWe got a history full of lightning victories\nConceptual breakthrough, it ain't no mystery\nLong vision from giants in every way\nRap czars, magnificent flows for every day\nFrom the East to the 'ville, from the West to the hills\nIncredible rhymes, encouraging skills\nFrom rat packs, the smallest crews were enormous\nWe hit 'em fast with an effortless performance\nMCs start fleeing in flocks\nEspecially those that's more sensitive to heat and shock\n\nWe grindin' down to the bone, my name grounded in stone\nI'm Mr. Violence we loungin' with chrome\nMr. Violence we lounge in his home, hit the housing on Rome\nShining like a hundred thousand in stones\nMove mountains with poems, got a jones for dinero\n1-6-zero my songs we throwin' elbows\nThe hoes cling, sho thing, we know kings\nOnly dime dikes with minds right, we choose Queens\n\nYeah, we wild like rockstars who smash guitars\nYo, son, split his face with the toast, he ain't ghost\nIt's no joke iron coat rifle with the stroke\nOne toke brains float, shot to the throat\nBefore the smoke hit, witness the killing, chilling crime scene\nBody on the block, eyes open from the shock\nOf being popped in the neck\nYet he still held a lit cigarette between his fingers\nDanger when you step into the chamber with the Masta\nDisaster, gotta blast ya cause I have to\n\nThe rat pack is back from the island of Stat'\nLeave you cursed dust, cause you worship the Gat\nThe first one to snap drunk off the Smirnoff\nBlow the bouncer's ear off, let him floss he the boss\nHandcuffed, to the turntables like Wizard Theodore\nSee it's pure, let it rain pearly ounces\nBang him with the thing that hang from the trousers\nYou don't want no drama, I'm flaming fast\nThat nigga jumped up and did the Damon Dash"}}, {"title": "ABC", "album": "House of Wax: The Vatican Mixtape, Vol. 3", "year": "2007-09-29", "lyrics": "Chunky, ???, Brolic,

house\nSlid through quietly then took the house\nSpazed out on the faggot then they moved me out\nHurry check the box office my new movie's out\nI'm not feelin broke niggas that be frontin for nothin\nStuntin, Wanna rock Playboy I keep it comin\nWord to Granny I'm quick to buck fifty somethin\nI'll be right up on that ass like you sixty somethin\nCome on\n\nBig head ants, Lamps that glow\nGoldfish with gold chains hangin from they necks, They swim slow\nWatch me poke Vics, Sit slick, Throw Vicks on it\nShip shit, Kick Arabic, Bag bricks, Karate kicks, Fly Wu bitch\nDon't hesitate

took a step back\nFamily ain't family no more, we used to play ball\nEggs after school, eat grits cause we was poor\nGrab the pliers for the channel, fix the hanger on the TV\nRockin each others pants to school wasn't easy\nWe survived winters, snotty nosed with no coats\nWe kept it real, but the older brother still had jokes\nSadly, Daddy left me at the age of six\nI didn't know nuttin' but mommy neatly packed his shit\nShe cried and grandma held the family down\nI guess mommy wasn't strong enough, she just went down\nCheck it, fifteen of us in a three bedroom apartment\nRoaches everywhere, cousins and aunts was there\nFour in the bed, two at the foot, two at the head\nI didn't like to sleep with Jon-Jon he peed the bed\nSeven o'clock, pluckin' roaches out the cereal box\nSome shared the same spoon, watchin' Saturday cartoons\nSugar water was our thing, every meal was no frill\nIn the summer, free lunch held us down like steel\nAnd there was days I had to go to Tech's house with a note\nStating, \"Gloria, can I borrow some food I'm dead broke\"\nSo embarrasin' I couldn't stand to knock on they door\nMy friends might be laughin', I spent stamps in stores\nMommy where's the toilet paper, use the newspaper\nLook Ms. Rose gave us a couch, she's the neighbor\nThings was deep, my whole youth was sharper than cleats\nTwo brothers with muscular dystrophy, it killed me\nBut I remember this, moms would lick her finger tips\nTo wipe the cold out my eye before school with her spit\nCase worker had her runnin' back to face to face\nI caught a case, housin' tried to throw us out of our place\nSometimes I look up at the stars and analyze the sky\nAnd ask myself was I meant to be here, why?\nYeah, yo\n\nAll that I got is you\nAnd I'm so thankful I made it through\nAll that I got is you\nAnd I'm so thankful I made it through\nAll that I got is you\nAnd I'm so thankful I made it through\nAll that I got is you\nAnd I'm so thankful I made it through\nAll that I got is you\nAnd I'm so thankful I made it through\n\nWord up mommy, I love you\nWord up\nIt was all you, word, you brought me in like this\n\nI sit and think about\nAll the times we did without dad\nI always said I woudn't cry\nWhen I saw tears in your eyes\nI understand that daddy's not here now\nBut some way or somehow, I will always be around, yeah\nAll the things that I did from this to them\nOh from drugs to being there\nBeing down and out and I love you always\n\nYeah, you say\nYou see the universe, which consists of the sun moon and star\nAnd them planets, that exist in my space\nLike man woman and child\nYou understand?\nWe got to keep it real, and what reality\nAnd reality will keep it real with us\nI remember them good ol' days\nBecause see, that's the child I was\nWhat made me the man I am today\nSee cause if you forget where you come from, heheh\nYou're never gonna make it where you're goin', aheh\nBecause you lost the reality of yourself\nSo take one stroll through your mind\nAnd see what you will find\nAnd you'll see a whole universe all over again\nAnd again and again and again and again"}}, {"title": "An Unexpected Call (Brown Tape)", "album": "The Brown Tape", "year":

this\nKid who pulled out bust a shot up in the Beacon\nCatch me in the corner not speakin'\nCrushed out heavenly, U.G. rock the sweet daddy long fox minks\nChicken and broccoli, Wally's look stink\nHe with his man straight from Raleigh Durham, he recognized Kojak\nI slapped him five, Masta Killa cracked his Heini for him\nEverybody break bread, huddle around\nGuzzle that, I'm about to throw hair on your back\nSince the face been revealed, game got real\nRadio been gassing niggas, my imposters scream they're ill\nI'm the inventor, '86 rhyming at the center\nDebut '93 LP told you to enter\nPunk faggot niggas stealing my light\nCrawl up in the bed with grandma\nBeneath the La-Z-Boy where you hid your knife\nGhost is back, stretch Cadillacs, fruit cocktails\nHit the shelves at Paul's Pastry Rack\nWalk with me like Dorothy try to judge these\nPlus Degrees, sessical, rasta fiends\nGetting waxed all through the drive-thru\nTake the stand, throw my hand all on the Bible\nAnd tell lies too, I'm the ultimate\nSplash the Wolverine Razor Sharp ring, dolomite\nStudent enroll holding it\n\nA-yo, this rap is like Ziti, facing me real TV\nCrash at high speeds, strawberry kiwi\nAs we approach your hood, the Gods bail\nThese Staten Island ferryboats cash bail\nFresh cellies, 50 deep up in the city\nWe banned for life, Apollo kids live to spit the real\n\nA pair of bright phat yellow Air Max\nHit the racks, snatch 'em up, son, twenty dollars off no tax\nDream merchant tucked in the cloud, stay splurging\nRock a eagle head, 6-inch height was the bird\nMonday night Dallas vs Jets, dudes slid in with one hand\nTwo Culture Ciphers, one bag of wet\nHeavy rain fucked my kicks up\nWasn't looking, splashed in the puddle\nBitch laughing, first thought was beat the bitch up\nMoseyed off gracefully, New York's most wanted cheeba hawk\nSeen the yellow brick road, I stole the pastries\nSame Ghostface, holy in the mind\nLast seen Manhattan Chase\nWithdrew the six-eight digit in the briefcase\nRawness, title is Hell-bound\nQuick to reload around faces, surround look astound\n\nWe split a fair one, Poconos money\nGin rummy with glare, spot the lame bidder's ear\nYo, and taste a teaspoon, 300 goons, stash balloons\nLocked in lab rooms, hit with the Glock, stashed in Grant's Tomb\nClocked him like a patient, his stocks fall, hustle invasion\nKnowing now, we copped the block off, the chain tri-color\nFreezing in velour, icicle galore\nGas station light gleaming on the wall\nCop WiseGuy jams, James Bond vans\nNiggas flipped Timbs, rock boats under water, watch clams\nPose for the stand-off, mad timid\nHoping that the gun fall, guessing like lottery balls, yo\n\nA-yo, this rap is like Ziti, facing me real TV\nCrash at high speeds, strawberry kiwi\nAs we approach your

been in every fucking room\nThere's gotta be coke\nThere is nothing, nothing.\"\n*heavy panting*\nHelp PLEASE!\n*panting continues*\nHelp me!\n*gunshot*\n\nIt's assassination day, I stalk\n\nI move through the Third World, my third eye's the guiding light\nInvite the fight, we all die tonight\nThe life I live's a 25 to life bid\nParole reneged, I stroll the globe fugitive\nCream is short, Cee Cipher Power stalk, plus the fiend talk\n3 Gs the cost in Supreme Court\nWhite lies and blackmail land me back in jail\nWe're all for sale, a stolen goal but it fail\nStranded on the front line, I shine to the dumb and blind\nIt comes time I take back what was once mine\nCrunch time in the first quarter, from the worst slaughter\nDevil's poisoning the birth water\nThe earth daughter rest her head on my chest\nThrough the struggle we cuddle under half-moon crest\nWhile the press plant fear and exploit the gun blasting\nCentral broadcasting is shackling, nerves are unfastened\nTrapped in deep water, gasping\nI clash with the titans for my half on the action\n\nI stop producers careers, the weak spot was the ears\nScorpion darts hits the mark, pierce the heart with silver spears\nYou're bewildered, my unsaturated, low filtered\nDevils still feel this so you're living build tilted\nMCs upon their axis, their body hazard tactic\nLactic acid, desert dry cactus, practice\nYou can never match this invincible, Wu-Tang indispensable\nOne nation under God, indivisible with liberty and justice\nThe mic is in my clutches\nThugs who bring ruckus leave in crutches\nUnforgivable snakes face the double-edged swords starts to swivel\nDecapitates the head, makes the projects more livable\nInterchangeable, caution: flammable\nMy chamber is 99 plus 1  unnameable angles\nAnd strangles, microphone cords start to dangle\nSilent as the gases that pass throughout your anal\nWe creep through your doors\nSeep out like sweat through the pores\nDestroy your internal organs with the biological warfare\n\nFirst of all before we move on, this shit is like a Yukon, don\nSpread it out like Grey Poupon\nSplurging, merging in the suburbs\nUsing this just like an adverb, action word, flowing like a blackbird\nGod came in, aiming like Terry Bradshaw\nHe hit the crash bar, stay relaxed God, his shit is smashed, Pa\nYou handle this just like algebra, UFO spot 'em like Galaga\nHolding like bullet-proof Acuras\nYou so fly, yeah right, you want to get me high, yo, Bobby\nYou hear how I'm shooting it like they blue tops\nNo, you won't play me like your lady\nPay me 380, spit it at you like a baby, final destination, Hades\n\nWar's extremely serious and it saddens me\nTo have to take things to deadly measures\nAnd have you measured and shot for no pay\nIt's assassination day I stalk my enemy like prey\nTranqued by deceptional sounds that deceives\nAnd lures MCs to the lair\nWith a mic-like bait, then awaits to be bitten by greed\nTemptation tempts my victim to proceed\nForward, ignorance wouldn't allow retreat\nYou'd rather pursue death than admit defeat\nNow who's best to describe for what I specialize in\nMurderous rhyming, constantly inclining\nMy mind spits with an enormous kickback\nYour brain then absorbs the impact\nDisorderly conduct from the crowd is the feedback\n\nIt's assassination day, I stalk", "image":

gotta be coke\nThere is nothing, nothing.\"\n*heavy panting*\nHelp PLEASE!\n*panting continues*\nHelp me!\n*gunshot*\n\nIt's assassination day, I stalk\n\nI move through the Third World, my third eye's the guiding light\nInvite the fight, we all die tonight\nThe life I live's a 25 to life bid\nParole reneged, I stroll the globe fugitive\nCream is short, Cee Cipher Power stalk, plus the fiend talk\n3 Gs the cost in Supreme Court\nWhite lies and blackmail land me back in jail\nWe're all for sale, a stolen goal but it fail\nStranded on the front line, I shine to the dumb and blind\nIt comes time I take back what was once mine\nCrunch time in the first quarter, from the worst slaughter\nDevil's poisoning the birth water\nThe earth daughter rest her head on my chest\nThrough the struggle we cuddle under half-moon crest\nWhile the press plant fear and exploit the gun blasting\nCentral broadcasting is shackling, nerves are unfastened\nTrapped in deep water, gasping\nI clash with the titans for my half on the action\n\nI stop producers careers, the weak spot was the ears\nScorpion darts hits the mark, pierce the heart with silver spears\nYou're bewildered, my unsaturated, low filtered\nDevils still feel this so you're living build tilted\nMCs upon their axis, their body hazard tactic\nLactic acid, desert dry cactus, practice\nYou can never match this invincible, Wu-Tang indispensable\nOne nation under God, indivisible with liberty and justice\nThe mic is in my clutches\nThugs who bring ruckus leave in crutches\nUnforgivable snakes face the double-edged swords starts to swivel\nDecapitates the head, makes the projects more livable\nInterchangeable, caution: flammable\nMy chamber is 99 plus 1  unnameable angles\nAnd strangles, microphone cords start to dangle\nSilent as the gases that pass throughout your anal\nWe creep through your doors\nSeep out like sweat through the pores\nDestroy your internal organs with the biological warfare\n\nFirst of all before we move on, this shit is like a Yukon, don\nSpread it out like Grey Poupon\nSplurging, merging in the suburbs\nUsing this just like an adverb, action word, flowing like a blackbird\nGod came in, aiming like Terry Bradshaw\nHe hit the crash bar, stay relaxed God, his shit is smashed, Pa\nYou handle this just like algebra, UFO spot 'em like Galaga\nHolding like bullet-proof Acuras\nYou so fly, yeah right, you want to get me high, yo, Bobby\nYou hear how I'm shooting it like they blue tops\nNo, you won't play me like your lady\nPay me 380, spit it at you like a baby, final destination, Hades\n\nWar's extremely serious and it saddens me\nTo have to take things to deadly measures\nAnd have you measured and shot for no pay\nIt's assassination day I stalk my enemy like prey\nTranqued by deceptional sounds that deceives\nAnd lures MCs to the lair\nWith a mic-like bait, then awaits to be bitten by greed\nTemptation tempts my victim to proceed\nForward, ignorance wouldn't allow retreat\nYou'd rather pursue death than admit defeat\nNow who's best to describe for what I specialize in\nMurderous rhyming, constantly inclining\nMy mind spits with an enormous kickback\nYour brain then absorbs the impact\nDisorderly conduct from the crowd is the feedback\n\nIt's assassination day, I stalk"}}, {"title": "Baby", "album": "Ghostdini: Wizard of Poetry in Emerald City", "year":

wack\nBut you don't get a nigga back like that, no\n\nI'm high powered, put Eva Mendes to sleep\nYo pardon, that bitch been on my mind all week\nBut back to you, MAC gloss chick, you're way fit\nHow you have everything in this world and waste it\nPrince told me it'll be okay\nI'm so sick like Ne-Yo say\nI'm laid back, like neo-soul\nI holla back at this Creole ho\nShe from the N.O., but she never told me \"N-O\" so\nWe at the spot to chill, where the food get grilled\nShe ordered the Kobe beef like Shaquille O'Neal\nSecond I walked in, the whole room got still\nI don't know how to put this, but I'm kind of a big deal\nAnd she conceited, she got a reason\nShe got her hair did, she got her weave in\nAnd I'mma sweat that out by the evening\nYou, I don't sweat that now, I got a new\n\nCome

and a bottle of coast out Mont'\nI'm that Don Wilson\nFirst one to put you up six suites in that Resident Hilton\nMink coach, colorful stones and big stacks\nYeah, I was fucking, but you don't get me back like that\nCausing me grief, you know me and homey had beef\nNow you got me losing my mind, out up in these streets\nYou flamingo, showing your true colors\nHeard ya'll was ducking down low when you see my brothers\nBut it's all good, I move from ex to next\nGot the baddest little chick to sign off of them checks\nFat bubble, her body's like one of the best\nBut I don't need to say nothing, ask Kanye West\nShe eye candy, smoother than Godiva chocolate\nAnd you mad cause you played yourself, it's your fault, trick\n\nCome through the block, in the brand new Benz\nKnowing that me and that nigga ain't friends\nYeah, what I did was wack\nBut you don't get a nigga back like that\nBouncing around, when I'm up in these streets\nKnowing that me and that nigga got beef\nYeah, what I did was wack\nBut you don't get a nigga back like that, no\n\nShot through the heart, the girl caught me\nShot through the block, with him shot gun\nHe lucky, I ain't stop, copped the shotgun\nKillah type cat, you better be glad, I'm not one\nHad a couple stars up in my sky\nShe was my moon and my sunshine\nDude ain't even fly, he just some guy\nYou blamed yourself, I'm done, peace, one\n\nCome through

white Wimbledon's\nSend them, my throat is the top session for men\nRap graduate, seen through the needles that was used by dopes\nFuck around and get rocked for three notes\nAnd fuck your bitch ass alligators\nWhen I see you on stage, throw out the gauge, my man's dough made us\n\nAiyo, elephant guns, mad ounces, colorful whips\nSlapped up bouncers, pouches\nBall like a unit, fly fragrance,

Millie Jackson chicks, dusted out Blondie\nSlide me, we wrote the bowl, we take the magnets\nMan handling mics, wool scarves, Evil Knievel bikes, I like eggs in my rice\nCircus money, read the Staten Island funnies\nEighty seven, Shallah rock, lotto's and the gumby\nTri-boro, fly negro, rap for Glaciers\nDo it for cee-lo games, cases, battle for bitches\nMillion dollar cribs, grandfather gamble those wit ribs, yes he did\nLife is wonderful, fly living rooms, brass brooms\nCatch me in the city of Watts, dusted out with Doc Doom\nSlide you, thirty six to the hip, you need Neo\nSock it to me G.O., the block we spot V.O\nLive at the handball session, white Wimbledon's\nSend them, my throat is the top session for men\nRap graduate, seen through the needles that was used by dopes\nFuck around and get rocked for three notes\nAnd fuck your bitch ass alligators\nWhen I see you on stage, throw out the gauge, my man's dough made us\n\nAiyo, elephant guns, mad ounces, colorful whips\nSlapped up bouncers, pouches\nBall like a unit, fly fragrance, faceless\nRarely out of spaceships, many fakes got lynched\nWe all pornographic, taylor made mortals\nLeanin' on suede walls, leather's on, ballers\nMaybe Benz lenses, sprayin' out of sixes, Christmas money\nVicious consolidated drama rip bitches\nThe rich version of black, skyscraper paper\nWu belt makers, show & prove that

bitches that was smelling like coke\nThey kept going  like they had shit in they throats\nThey had stacks on the tables, cables\nI had to say it was like early May\nA few days 'til my birthday date, baby date\nI'll play to the sucker DJ, looking like Enrique\nTold him to throw in that Supreme Cliee-ente\nHe said just gave a nod with a thumbs-up wink\nI just put down my dollar bill, took off my mink\nBartenders know we big spenders, gave us those mobster drinks\nSent us lobsters and cigars that stink\nPlaying them oldie-but-goodie classics, them honies had fat asses\nNoses runnin' from the raw, they hid behind they glasses\nToney with the Montana, I came to play\nWith my long fingernail, your honey should pass that yay\nLet me see what color you got boo, I got that beige\nI see y'all from the perihperals, ladies far right from the stage\nI'm 33, I look 26 with big furs on\nWhat y'all inherit, the Santa Maria?\nY'all money that long?\nYour father must have fell back when y'all started fucking\nYou asked me what I think about dude? I say \"fuck him\"\nAnd this one bitch called me Fat Albert\nThe way my pockets had the mumps, you know that Ghost is 'bout it\nThen I asked these young ladies do they buff helmets\nThey said \"fuck you\", took a sniff and then they didn't tell me\nJust because you left home, this is Tone\nYo, you see I flip stones\nBirthstone, you ain't grown fuck around and get boned\n3 rich pretty young ladies lost at 6, Gucci kicks\nAnd they picky when it come to they dick\nIf y'all ladies was all mine I'd teach you well\nFree tales, sweet smells, eat well, hear bells\nBefore you sleep, read your books like it was my fanmail\nAnd when you wake, you be a new woman, know the whole world can tell\nWord life, put you to school when the clubs'll stop\nCollege girl, pay for your books at 200 a pop\nAnd all I ask in life's for you to be careful\nStay focused, take care of your health\nHave kids and marry a prince\nGood luck and happiness\nAnd no longer shut yourself in, taste the pain, the sorrow\nThe sun'll shine and still come out tomorrow\nAnd maybe be a secretary, business woman, 5th Ave., or run a library\nYou got the right conversation, education and looks\nWith the right intelligence to stay away from them crooks\nBaby get on your feet, be an accountant, doctor, lawyer or nurses's aid\nComputer wizard, you about to get paid\n\nYea\nYou know I just met y'all\nAnd I love y'all already and all that\nBut I gotta get off that nose candy\nTo make it in life and all that shit\nThat's why I'm here\nI'm like a father figure and all that shit\nI let y'all get high, and that's all you're going to do but\nYa'nawm sayin?\nCause I drop jewels all over the place\nY'all too pretty for that\nSome of y'all nose hairs is burnt\nI just want you to snap out of it\nYou know why? cause you's a"}}, {"title": "Biscuits", "album": "The Pretty Toney Album", "year": "2004-04-20", "lyrics": "Yo... who the fuck brought me this chocolate shit, man?\nI said a banana nutriment, man\nYa'll heard the fuck I said...

"Burn something kid\n\nYeah, youknowwhatImsaying, let me tell you something man\nThrough the man's mind, God\nHe see his elevation, God\nSee through his mind, he see his elevation, God\nSee this where he begin to know that where he come from\nSee some people don't have no direction, God\nBecause they don't know the science of they self\nSee the signs of life is the signs of you\nAll the elements that it took to create you\nEverything that's in the universe, God\nThat's created the universe, God, is just within you\nYou see what I'm sayin?\nAnd that's the mind that you can't see\nDon't you know if a man could take and flip himself inside out, God\nHe'll fall out and die if he sees the shit that goes on...inside?\n\nSo you mean to tell me I'm the creator of all this right here?\n\nYou the creator of all this\nBecause all these things must happen, it must take place\nSee people go back in the day, God\nThey say: one man, one woman, Adam and Eve, there ain't no such thing\nEverything you see always has been and always will what be\nRegardless the womb or what, it's got to be\n\nHit me, hit me, hit me, I don't wanna hear nothin\nWord Up\nGot to pay\nYeah, it's like that right?\nBlow his back out, make his shoes worth\n\nA-yo, this shit be off the noggin rock it\nWhatever cock block it\nCat get blown, who own this street corner\nForeigner hesitate to rock a Hummer\nNavy Seal top runner, rhyme this summer\nFor real, marinating nigga's skating\nDebating waiting style flowingly relating\nFine line switch it on ya, like venetian blinds\nThe mission is mine, fabulous king I divine\nTitanium Hydro collide though\nYo dun dun polly this conjunction, son one\nSlang doctor, medicated kids pay it\nSay it, these niggas in affect dun, stay rap related\nCassette rhymer, 5-G consigner, line for liner\nPoet designer, sharp like Linus\nMic of the year award, fly gear award\nThem niggas over there be analyzing with one sword\nGet bent, pay the rent, plus still we invent\nNuff shit to get your whole team crazily sent\nNow all I need is a half gallon of weed\nProceed, to bust this mic dick and make three seeds\nThen max out like two Ac's inside the parking lot\nSon bark a lot and get his team hit in the dark a lot\nWhat now blow, clicking like a calico\nGold, Maximillion, one love keep it real yo\n\nYo, hit me for these Tommy Hill, ice-rocking niggas\nPeace, this summer's mines, I blow the biggest\nBack up off me, while I grab my dick and hold the Heini\nPark the Blue 600, Wally kings is right behind me\nTackle clubs, never rock Lugz, I'm way above\nThese mics is like the Golden Gloves verses spark plug\nIts like the pennant, seminar's the play-off\nStart the J off like Cochran got OJ off\nThis specialist who eyeballed your mistress necklace\nPerpetuous, this curly-head kid's treacherous\nLet go the eggo, so we can dip dip dive like Lego\nThrow on can-can, eat that plus this instrumental\nAh shit say Stark-ologist\nStarks-ologist, fried fish halibut\nPull out the bull horn, let's celebrate like Kunta was born\nWe elbowed our way inside Loud and got on\nI played the building, burn a branch and get filled in\nLike Pilgrims G-in' Pepridge farms from out of millions\nWho wanna rhyme, who wanna challenge the swordmans\nThat rock that fisherman hat like Gorton's\n\nI hold down the place, no shots to the face\nElite Special force no religious style faith\nThe melting pot boil gun shot drama soil\nGamble when I scramble handle hot pots of oil\nManhandle pain killing erect my hidden\nStreets made me potent put your 9-6 bid in\nVampire curse disperse on each verse\nSwim in black water, axe slaughter through my earth\nYou're hit by my element Great Wall of China\nMountain peak holds the globe like vagina\nMeasure on my mic stand, molecule and strand\nFinger rolling rhythm ride the horse one hand\nGolden Eye, Spy vs. Spy, guilty of suspicion\nChess boxer, mic in dead body position\n40 oz. Ciga-art, three verse invention\nDivine universal black man representing\nSimilar to pure, rhyme blowing out the pore\nBattery in the back, keep me charged for the raw\nI'm bred type thorough, pistolero gun hero\nRenaissance rebel chatter-boxing your barrel\nFully woven Beethoven, hit you on a humble\nHard enough to hurt you, chastise my rap styles\nLock down, for this curfew"}}, {"title":

metal, eighteen carats or better\nBlue Steel or Beretta, I'mma stack that feta\nGuacamole, my shit is fat, I call it Roly Poly\nNiggas is screamin' like, Damn Ghost holy moly\nThe baddest bitch is walkin' two steps behind me\nCause the god's robes flaring out, shit I don't care about\nOne false move on the kid, I'm airing out\nDumpin', pellets be hop skip an' a jumpin'\nWith the automatic shotgun, hand on the pumpin'\nDum, dum, watch your whole body flop\nAnd wild the fuck out, I'm like a bull in the china shop\nBeasty, I can walk on cut glass, I bust ass\nNiggas better cover they face or get slashed\nOr see me an' ya granny in the yard gettin' trashed\n\nAyo back out, give em the whole thing, Black out\nSqueeze until it spring break nigga, Black out\nYou run out of bullets then swing nigga, Black out\nDon't give a fuck about a thing nigga, Black out\n\nI chant warrior songs for all my warriors gone\nSpit the blood, sweat, and tears, y\u2019all just call it a song\nYes I\u2019m highly explosive, Yes I\u2019m something ferocious\nNiggas fuckin\u2019 with my nerves like multiple sclerosis\nWatch out, you\u2019ll get your food ate\nGive em a buck and a half across the face and scrape the plate\nI lift your motherfuckin hood up like a mechanic\nAnd leave you layin for life in your hammock, god dammit\nThis is marksmen\n\nMy niggas is prone to black out\nDouble-handed out the Chevrolet until it max out\nMo Ps is Gs, these niggas tap out\nBuck-a-buck-buck-buck-buck-buck-buck, push your back out\nIf you don't know what that's bout, pack up and stab out\nMake a decision or deal with conditions when I spaz out\nUnload, reload, unload, reload\nHand 'em a couple more, and keep a couple for the road\n\nPull out the ratchet, this is not rappity rap shit\nIt's, liver then Super Fly saliva when the MAC spit\nThat, raat, tip-tip-tip-tip-tip tap shit\nThat you cannot stick to landing like Gabby Douglas when you backflip\nMy Hammer Dance'll make y'all niggas do The Running Man\n'77 blackout, Berkowitz, Son of Sam\nUnderstand what you working with is WordPerfect\nThe earth surface is most prolific circuit breaker break your circuits\nEnter your information, we blacks out\nSpontaneous combustion, instantaneous gentrification\nPop your melon like Gallagher, you won't survive\nPsychopath with a silencer, my caliber is forty five\nTumultuous tragedy, infamous, infamy\nThese egregious statistics will increase exponentially\nPotentially, my brain is probably twisted\nThis auto shotty lifted your body and dropped it like a molly\nKid shit"}}, {"title": "Black Out (Twelve Reasons To Die II)", "album": "Twelve Reasons To Die II", "year": "2015-07-10", "lyrics": "Yo, Kane, let's get 'em\nI'm talking blackout\nPut lives to

that pimp this\nCaught up in my spell, smell exotic, blunt from different trees\nBlack gloves, bullets will fly when the 9's squeezed\nGhost and I thick as thieves, robbing the whole globe\nBlack

relentless, murderous intentions\nThe henchmen's garments is all black, that's the winners that pimp this\nCaught up in my spell, smell exotic, blunt from different trees\nBlack gloves, bullets will fly when the 9's squeezed\nGhost and I thick as thieves, robbing the whole globe\nBlack polo, hooded, with Gucci robes with a nice grip\nSo when the blood hit the floor, I won't slip\nDynamic with my dialogue, you faggots is hog meat\nCrack your cranium like crab claws if you cross me\nRaging Bull in the booth, Mr. Kane is so raunchy\n\nDeath Row shit, fuck the lethal injection\nExecute him and chop up his body in sections\nClean-cut butcher knives\nX their eyes out\nNail 'em to a billboard\nLet 'em dry out\n\nLet me show you what crime about, I'm blowing your minds out\nIf you ain't ready to throat a nigga, then sign out\nNickel-plated 40's are blowing your spine out\nOld-school Caddies with coke, come take a line out\nStingin' niggas for their jewels in their stash house\nSnatch a nigga up by his butterfly, sing him a lullaby\nClosed-casket, make sure his mother cry\nYou fuckin' with grimy guys, tunes are suicidal\nAnd now we ain't homies, they call us the homicidal\nGet ready for the mayhem, just call it my arrival\n\nBash him with a disco ball, it's the 70's\nDrop a set of the Daily News so they remember these\nBlack bastards, ruthless killers\n\nWatch me thrill ya\nParty killers, we won't die\nHard-body, bitch-made cats is gonna fry\nSolidify we're champions, youngins, we're bona fide\nWanna swim with the sharks, be my guest, go take a dive\nThe name of the game is Bloodsport\nYou won't make it out alive\nI see what you trying for, so give it up\nWe terrorize shit, Kane and Ghost, lit it up"}}, {"title": "Black Tequila", "album": "Apollo Kids", "year":

dirty\nUp in the Arizona desert, where the shit get ugly\nAll my Staten Island riders, ride or die honchos\nGet CREAM all day, leave our poncho\nWe bull fighting niggas, wrestle with broncos\nAnd my team stay tight like Silver and Tonto\nCarry a long whip, ya'll whip ya ass\nHard head Mexican dope, mixed with hash\nMachete behind dough, with a rip in the slash\nDesperado kids, me and Ghost, back

bitch who's Albino, I met her out in Chi-Town\nWhile I was out in Greek town, ordering gyros\nThe bad bitch keep a tool and a bible, quick to murder her rivals\nAnd her pops was a gangsta disciple\nHe killed about a thousand vice lords, guns and knife wars\nThe feds came for him, so slick to the night ward\nDown in the N.O., and right before he left\nHe wrote his daughter a memo, left stacks in the Benzo\nIt got hot, niggas selling, giving out the info\nHe paranoid, every 20 seconds out the window\nBlow it in the limbo, he spazzed on Lorenzo\nAnd smashed him in the head with his own son's Nintendo\nAbout a week later, the boys came and rushed him\nKicked down his door, while he sleeping and cuffed him", "image":

tracklisting\"\n\nYeah, assorted flavor Clarks\nNo doubt\nIt be the champ\nYeah, curly head kid\nYo, yo, yo\nFrom Gators to blazers, low fades and razors\nBig dick saloon, I contact the womb; the black asian\nWhich location keeps circulating\nMy wonder twin power activate - shit on this nation\nAllah seen represent the gummy with the green\nWho walk mean stand up on your block and burn a bean\nSir Ballentine, lookin at that bitch wide behind\nThe thing that's fuckin up a girl is that swine\nThen turn around take my last pull off the L\nThese niggas on the block keep looking at me well\nBut they want the jewel it ain't hard to tell\nI recognize his face, he actin like Denzel\nBut fuck him, I went to check low for chop\nOn a ball gone the size like faith up top\nNow it's a whole new ball game, strategic mind frame\nMy dialogue's rebellious raid and razor fame\nGlass out a red light, see Killah get on a ninja bike\nShow my love to the God he peeled out and made a right\n{*Sound of speeding motorcycle*}\n\nWhen you walking down the street with your - Box in your hand\nAnd you bringing the music of the - Wu-Tang Clan\nAnd you hear Ironman on your - radio rapping\nYour feet start the dancing and your - hands start the clapping\n\nStreet's running through your dancehall gunning\nLike Lee Harvey Oswald stunning slapping MC's with summons\nFor pumping - that watered down substance\nBeef there's slugs finger creeping\nMaking moves like Crying Freeman\nPrince of thieves, earth's third seed\nHeavyweight like golden fleeces homicides stroll the street\nIn Blue Caprices, look at the thugs holding heat\nIn the city beef got me plotting trilogy\nTo the smoke enemies sneak attacks I'm beyond and above that\nSeen that done that, respect black\nI catch a slug to your hardhat\nLounging in the everglades, surfing the airwave\nCatch a buck fifty where the razorblades swiftly\nShaolin cats be shiesty, strictly\nDrunk off the Irish whiskey\n\n\nRest your headpiece on this one son\nCough up a lung\nSleeping on my murderous type ones I get you done\nI'm looking at these cuthroat kids and how they live\nIt's like we was partners in spades and you renege\nCan't fuck with no nigga like that he get me jack\nOr sent back, meaning whole life fade to black\nI'm looking in the half of right and roll tight\nFool me once but can't fool me twice, I'm 25\nTo life on this mic device I'm nothing nice\nA mixture of long wild rice and no spice\nInflicted, rap addicted, track I stick it, flip it\nDaddy long dick-ed, slide\nA little bit beyond twisted, mind in stitches\nYou thought weak but meant wicked\nNiggas choke off my second hand smoke lifted\nEveryday is like my birthday I'm mad gifted, dead calm\nHit me with the eighteen bronze, buddah palm\nAbout to blow like Napalm, before your arm\nPrepare for the warfare, or buy a share\nOh what the fuck we dealing with, yeah\nJohnny about to go there\nNeed another year\nBust a shot for my sons that didn't make it here"}}, {"title": "Buck 50", "album": "Supreme Clientele", "year": "2000-02-08", "lyrics": "Who I'm is?

I don't like your fucking attitude\"\nFronting on my Clan from the Stat but we ain't mad at you\n\nStarks with the parcheesi face, measly paced ofays Ghostface\nJump out the window for a little taste\nThe joopy look, my main bitches call me lazy\nEducated birds say, \"Ghost you so crazy!\"\n\nCappa slide through with the Ghost\nPost up like paint on walls\nDrip jewels, big heat\nRuffle inside the bubble goose, it's the Odd Couple\nHollow points follow you home to Staten Island\nPlaying with the big toys that make noise\nEcho in the hall, a scared voice\nNiggas start to act choice, but Duncan Hines\nDidn't know Betty Crocker had the two nines\nMade the club moist, shattered the windows\nDustheads running\nThe rap kingpin plus the Black Jesus is coming\n\nThe words you talk better be the words you walk\nBody you in the bed where the nurses are\nPut your vein out, watch me insert the dart\nTil it plagues from Bricks to the Persian Gulf\nLight circuits off, thirty-third of my brain is off\nThat explains why my language off\nMy gun aim and cough, y'all ain't trained to brawl\nY'all more like in training bras\nWet behind the ear, you're not prepared\nFor the project flow, with extra stairs\nI pass out a vest to wear (bullets flyin)\nYo, the hard wire, starting bonfires\nPull the mask so you know it's me\nAnd your weed got more seeds than ODB\nCan't smoke with ya, watch Ghost tie a rope to ya\nDef and Wu will open ya\n\nEat a dick like (huh) baby shake your shit\nGirl you're thick like (huh) getting rich like (huh)\n\nWord, it's me y'all\nWe in two sixes flirting with bitches, dime plus\nTaking pictures, How you doing baby? My name Ghost\nDon't get caught up in my chains or the way that I speak\nSeek intelligence, slickest nigga going since \"Grease\"\nCheck out the grays on the side of my waves\nI grew those on Rikers Island\nStressed out, balled up in the cage\nPull a boot out on Jimmy Jam, text takes jam\nSilky texture, Jordan jumped up like Clyde Drexler\nAll up in the parrot, nose numb, real as they come\nBiggie's Versaces, snow white rabbit\nHands is like photographic magic\nFuneral love, move in when we hug, don't make it a habit\nHit the gym for two weeks, my back all chiseled\nElbows unique now meet the new me\nGhetto fabulous, Tone Atlas\nZulu Nation in the 80's in front of Macy's I start my own chapters\nTyco Nite-Glow velvet pose, special effects\nHigh-tech armors merc you at the shows\nSupercalifragalisticexpialidocious\nDociousaliexpifragalisticcalisuper\nCancun, catch me in the room, eating grouper\n\nShoe fly shoe, Wally Don Clark crew\nFuck y'all wanna do, crack a brew, smoke an L or two\nAnd flip like (huh) killing for the whole\nClique is sick like (huh) you and your stank bitch\nEat a dick like (huh) baby shake your shit\nGirl you're thick like (huh) getting rich like (huh)", "image": "https://images.genius.com/f0013dbd91dff7fd77352a0283ad6ec5.1000x1000x1.jpg", "artist": "Ghostface Killah", "raw": {"annotation_count": 25, "api_path": "/songs/1692",

I don't like your fucking attitude\"\nFronting on my Clan from the Stat but we ain't mad at you\n\nStarks with the parcheesi face, measly paced ofays Ghostface\nJump out the window for a little taste\nThe joopy look, my main bitches call me lazy\nEducated birds say, \"Ghost you so crazy!\"\n\nCappa slide through with the Ghost\nPost up like paint on walls\nDrip jewels, big heat\nRuffle inside the bubble goose, it's the Odd Couple\nHollow points follow you home to Staten Island\nPlaying with the big toys that make noise\nEcho in the hall, a scared voice\nNiggas start to act choice, but Duncan Hines\nDidn't know Betty Crocker had the two nines\nMade the club moist, shattered the windows\nDustheads running\nThe rap kingpin plus the Black Jesus is coming\n\nThe words you talk better be the words you walk\nBody you in the bed where the nurses are\nPut your vein out, watch me insert the dart\nTil it plagues from Bricks to the Persian Gulf\nLight circuits off, thirty-third of my brain is off\nThat explains why my language off\nMy gun aim and cough, y'all ain't trained to brawl\nY'all more like in training bras\nWet behind the ear, you're not prepared\nFor the project flow, with extra stairs\nI pass out a vest to wear (bullets flyin)\nYo, the hard wire, starting bonfires\nPull the mask so you know it's me\nAnd your weed got more seeds than ODB\nCan't smoke with ya, watch Ghost tie a rope to ya\nDef and Wu will open ya\n\nEat a dick like (huh) baby shake your shit\nGirl you're thick like (huh) getting rich like (huh)\n\nWord, it's me y'all\nWe in two sixes flirting with bitches, dime plus\nTaking pictures, How you doing baby? My name Ghost\nDon't get caught up in my chains or the way that I speak\nSeek intelligence, slickest nigga going since \"Grease\"\nCheck out the grays on the side of my waves\nI grew those on Rikers Island\nStressed out, balled up in the cage\nPull a boot out on Jimmy Jam, text takes jam\nSilky texture, Jordan jumped up like Clyde Drexler\nAll up in the parrot, nose numb, real as they come\nBiggie's Versaces, snow white rabbit\nHands is like photographic magic\nFuneral love, move in when we hug, don't make it a habit\nHit the gym for two weeks, my back all chiseled\nElbows unique now meet the new me\nGhetto fabulous, Tone Atlas\nZulu Nation in the 80's in front of Macy's I start my own chapters\nTyco Nite-Glow velvet pose, special effects\nHigh-tech armors merc you at the shows\nSupercalifragalisticexpialidocious\nDociousaliexpifragalisticcalisuper\nCancun, catch me in the room, eating grouper\n\nShoe fly shoe, Wally Don Clark crew\nFuck y'all wanna do, crack a brew, smoke an L or two\nAnd flip like (huh) killing for the whole\nClique is sick like (huh) you and your stank bitch\nEat a dick like (huh) baby shake your shit\nGirl you're thick like (huh) getting rich like (huh)"}}, {"title": "Call My Name", "album": "36 Seasons", "year": "2014-12-09", "lyrics": "I grace the block with my presence; all praises do\nNow the neighborhood like \"Tony we love you\"\nIt's all good and staying at my brother Mick's house\nMade his house my home.

Lauryn\nWaist like a Coke bottles scoring\nPretty young thing loved the swings\nAt times she got my ding-a-ling hard\nWhen she said push hard, she kept Vaseline\nOpen as she swung back, couldn't help her dress blew back\nNow held accountable right for my actions\nRight before the Wallabee Champ was rocking Wallows\nDrawing cards, sent her rap message through a bottle\nLines from Dolemite, few tips from Goines\nBirthday, gave her two fifty cent coins\nPuppy love, gorgeous face, amazed by lip gloss\nCherry scent, when the princess spoked yo it bounched off\nMole like Marilyn Monroe, threw a rose in her mouth\nWherever God go will be Mrs. Cole\nGirl's so pretty, kids with little biddies hope the years go slow, slow\nSurrounded by intelligence, life through education healthy minds will grow, grow\nCatch me on a bus-stop, dusted, cursin out the cops\nBut still come and vibe with me\nEverybody's talking about Wu-Tang fronting\nBut you still telling lies to me\nBeautiful in lightshows, having no intentions on love\nBut having strung I suppose, here we go\nIt's not the way she bubbed the gum\nShooked her ass, I'm not the one\nDouble dutch, waiting for the bus with faggot Laurie son\nNow 'N Later lady 7th floor, building 7-80\nFancy fox, booties for her socks, nothing else can change me\nYoung Nefertiti, knowledge seed with no jewelry on\nTahitian fresh berry tree, she's a capricorn\nI really liked the girl, had dreams about her\nThinking to myself some nights she got (\"louder\")\nBut hating, was Sheneneh and Grace and Keylolo\nTrick bitches jumped my boo at the school a few years ago\nHit me, you hit me, Grace got the last hit\nEh yo, the bitches started swinging and shit, so I jumped in\nThose were the days, made faces in school plays\nPaper trays, city wide test, made half a days\nShooting puppy water, might hump the pillow, dick a inch taller\nStapleton bum nigga, I'll pop her cherry for her\nFresh Air Fund, nail\u2019s done, alphabets berets\nJellies, bubble yum, soda tongue, too young to cum\nThen engage him with them candy rings a-yo, I hit that shit\nGot jealous when she kissed Rob\nI broke her Chick-O-Sticks\n\nGuys and girls\nY'all remember those days and shit\nGirls walk around in school\nOne ponytail with the beret\nNeck's looking like baby powder, youknowhatImean\nThose were the days right there\nBoston Baked Beans, girls come to school with mad candy\nYouknowhatImean\nYou'd just come in school for half days, and all that\nJust to see that little girl right there, ? to this\nGo home and think about it, youknowhatImean\nMay hump the bed sometimes on her, youknowhatImean\nWord, those days man, those, those were the good old days right there G\nThat shit was fun, lunchroom, see in the lunchroom, youknowhatImean\nMight get a little, go to the G.O. Store or something, youknowhatImean\nWord, buy a little chocolate, a little shake or something, youknowhatImean\nA little buttercrunch joints or something, youknowhatImean\nThat's that real shit, G I miss those shits, man\nI wanna go back to school, man\nThat's my word, man\nFor real y'all, those were, those were the\nGoddamn y'all, you remember"}}, {"title": "Chinatown Wars", "album": null,

it's Tony, revenge is so sweet\nAnd I move with artillery, roaming the streets\nMy guns is ginormous, bullets is heatseeking\nBig Brother got the eye on me, I watch how I'm speaking\nAnd I move like a porn star in charm school\nI stick everything I see, but I only take jewels\nAnd cash rules, pills and that cocaine powder\nI ain't a man, I'm a killer, obsessed with power\nAnd revenge, I don't need friends and shiesty activities\nMove alone through the City that they call Liberty\nAnd trust nobody but my bullets and my shotty\nCarjack a fool twist his limbs like pilates\nOx' him, buck 50 stitch him, Chinatown Wars\nI chop 'em up like rice in the kitchen\nIt's a bad decision, starting beef with the butcher\nHe ain't a bleeder, I pop him son, your man is a gusher\n\n\nClap on, clap off\nFake ass street thugs, either need to ax off, or cough\nFeel 'em, Metal Finger steel drum\nClean the sidewalk with him, talk shit to real scum\nOf the earth, take it with a shovelful\nMain character, super villain, lovable\nAnd don a mask like a crown of thorns\nBlow your horn and get pounded out by the boring\n(I take your order) let me get one wing\nAny king that bring this sting for Chung King\nNo change, no stranger to gats\nTook notice, what so strange is no cats\nDogs is wars, dud luck, draw straws\nFuck the boss, drowned on blood and duck sauce\nStuck the enemy, a wack deal caper\nFor racks of fake Fendi and stacks of real paper\n\n\nYo, it's a manhunt, my mentality's militia\nIf my four-fifth had lips, I'd make it French kiss ya\nCuz no mission's impossible, I carry my Wu-Tang sword\nOn my back, and attack all obstacles\nBurnt down buildings, avenging my father's death\nA store for ransom, and snatch your crystal meth\nI pillage, my warpath is unpredictable\nLeave 'em dead on arrival, broke up or critical\n\nWar nine, frying swine to pork rinds\nFor trying to walk the fine line, thoughts flying\nHad more fun with a crooked rookie\nWent for his gun, cracked his skull like a fortune cookie\nA mind reader, find out, speak, freaks bow\nWith the nine heater, beat feet and smile now\nTen paces, about face, chase me\nWe make it sound crazy than a case of M-80's", "image":

when the boss is slayed\n\nAiyo, what up homie, it's Tony, revenge is so sweet\nAnd I move with artillery, roaming the streets\nMy guns is ginormous, bullets is heatseeking\nBig Brother got the eye on me, I watch how I'm speaking\nAnd I move like a porn star in charm school\nI stick everything I see, but I only take jewels\nAnd cash rules, pills and that cocaine powder\nI ain't a man, I'm a killer, obsessed with power\nAnd revenge, I don't need friends and shiesty activities\nMove alone through the City that they call Liberty\nAnd trust nobody but my bullets and my shotty\nCarjack a fool twist his limbs like pilates\nOx' him, buck 50 stitch him, Chinatown Wars\nI chop 'em up like rice in the kitchen\nIt's a bad decision, starting beef with the butcher\nHe ain't a bleeder, I pop him son, your man is a gusher\n\n\nClap on, clap off\nFake ass street thugs, either need to ax off, or cough\nFeel 'em, Metal Finger steel drum\nClean the sidewalk with him, talk shit to real scum\nOf the earth, take it with a shovelful\nMain character, super villain, lovable\nAnd don a mask like a crown of thorns\nBlow your horn and get pounded out by the boring\n(I take your order) let me get one wing\nAny king that bring this sting for Chung King\nNo change, no stranger to gats\nTook notice, what so strange is no cats\nDogs is wars, dud luck, draw straws\nFuck the boss, drowned on blood and duck sauce\nStuck the enemy, a wack deal caper\nFor racks of fake Fendi and stacks of real paper\n\n\nYo, it's a manhunt, my mentality's militia\nIf my four-fifth had lips, I'd make it French kiss ya\nCuz no mission's impossible, I carry my Wu-Tang sword\nOn my back, and attack all obstacles\nBurnt down buildings, avenging my father's death\nA store for ransom, and snatch your crystal meth\nI pillage, my warpath is unpredictable\nLeave 'em dead on arrival, broke up or critical\n\nWar nine, frying swine to pork rinds\nFor trying to walk the fine line, thoughts flying\nHad more fun with a crooked rookie\nWent for his gun, cracked his skull like a fortune cookie\nA mind reader, find out, speak, freaks bow\nWith the nine heater, beat feet and smile now\nTen paces, about face, chase me\nWe make it sound crazy than a case of M-80's"}}, {"title": "Chunky", "album": null, "year": null, "lyrics": "Hey miss what up, Tone got luck\nI wore a lot of jewelry and I never got stuck\nCats

against DeLucas, bullets in all directions\nDuck at the safe house and re-up your ammo\nIt's a battlefield out here and they're moving with camo\nAyo, headline reads \"Bodies is left butchered\"\nWhole family killed and tossed in the bushes\nIt's a massacre bringing out the faces of death\nAyo, Wigs, tell priest how they murdered the rest"}}, {"title": "Daytona 500", "album":

to them clear, and put the box right near your ear\nLight your blunts and down your beers\n'Cause you could never fuck with Wu-Tang Killer Beez\n\"From where we at to my man's cell\nFrom where we at\"\n\nSay peace to cats who rock MAC Knowledge Knowledges\nStreet astrologists, light up the mic God, acknowledge this\nFly joints that carry two points, Corolla Motorola holder\nPlay it God, E-pack over the shoulder\nChrome tanks, player like Yanks, check the franchise\nFront on my guys, my enterprise splash many lives\nRepel all fakes like reflectors\nHe had sugar in his ear in his last crack career\nWe can can him, manhandle him, if you wanna\nRun in his crib-o, get ditto, skate like a limo\nAnd jet to the flyest estate, relate take a break\nBreak down an eighth and then wait, drop it like Drake\nThugs they be booing and screwing, we canoeing\nClaim they doing the same shit we doing, fuck a union\nIt's the same style, RZA train a boy, jump the turnstile\nOn the island he tried to challenge God for the new bals\nEspecially that, aluminum bat in the Ac\nRelax, lay back, sell a grenade a day, it pays black\nThe Mac-10 flex wipe cats like Windex\nIndex finger be sore busting these fly scripts\nThe Wally kid count crazily grands with our plans\nLaying with my bitches and my mans in Lex Lands\nWe losing 'em, jet to the stash in Now Jerusalem\nAbusing 'em, rocking his jewels like we using 'em\nLow pro star, seven thick waves rock Polar\nRoll with the older Gods, build with the Sun, Moon and Star\n\nAll these MC's start realizing\nThat Ghost got that shit that'll keep you vibing\nThe Wu is here to bring you Shaolin's finest\nBut if your skills are weak you better step behind us\n\"Ghostface--Ghostface Killah!!\"\n\nMercury raps is roughed then God just shown like taps\nRed and white Wally's that match, bend my baseball hat\nDoing forever shit like pissing out the window on turnpikes\nRobbing niggas for leathers, high swiping on dirt bikes\nVoice be mellow like Vaughn Harper, Radio Barber\nMurder sleep away camp, the fly lady champ\nThe arsonist, who burn with his pen regardless\nSlaying all these earthlings and fake foreigners\nIn the Phillipines, pick herbal beans, bubbling strings\nBiochemical cream, we burn kerosene\nThe conviction of my tape is rape, wicked like Nixon\nBlond heads, inscriptions with three sixes in\nKiss the pyramid experiment with high explosive\nI slapbox with Jesus, lick shots at Joseph\nZoom in like binoculars, the rap blacksmith\nMoney's Rolex, was rockless, Chef ragtop is spotless\nI'm Iron Man no die-cast metal, I'm steel-alloy\nTrue identity hidden inside secret tabloids\nBreathe oxygen, both sides of my jaw carry oxes\nThe track hit like the bangers, in hundred watt boxes\nYo jostling these cats while Little J be deli-ing\nSip Irish Moss out of Widelians\n\"rhymes like retail, make sure shit sell\nFrom where we at to my man's cell\"\n\nAll these MC's start realizing\nThat Ghost got that shit that'll keep you vibing\nThe Wu is here to bring you Shaolin's finest\nBut if your skills are weak you better step behind us\n\"Cappa-Cappa-Cappa-Cappachino\"\n\nGive me the the fifty thou, small bills\nMy gold plate, my slang kills\nMy beer spills, what up lils?\nMurder one dun\nKiller bee stung, guess who back home son\nMy technique of slang camp won, third platoon soon\nCristal bottles, cages of boom, Papi wardrobe\nThe mad-hatter big dick style, beware goons\nSmuggle balloons, lornadoones in fat pussy wounds\nLet the Gods build, pull up the grill\nCheck out the mad skills\nTop secret technique, too hard for you to peep it and keep it\nJiggy style of rap and watching knuckle slang sweep it\nOut of order tape recorder can't record my slaughter\nSpoil the rotten Donna too good to be forgotten\nHigh top notch, borderline rhymes is hand-cocked\nNinety-six, my ill sound clash is still hot\nGet yourself shot\n\nAll these MC's start realizing\nThat Ghost got that shit that'll keep you

could never fuck with Wu-Tang Killer Beez\n\"From where we at to my man's cell\nFrom where we at\"\n\nSay peace to cats who rock MAC Knowledge Knowledges\nStreet astrologists, light up the mic God, acknowledge this\nFly joints that carry two points, Corolla Motorola holder\nPlay it God, E-pack over the shoulder\nChrome tanks, player like Yanks, check the franchise\nFront on my guys, my enterprise splash many lives\nRepel all fakes like reflectors\nHe had sugar in his ear in his last crack career\nWe can can him, manhandle him, if you wanna\nRun in his crib-o, get ditto, skate like a limo\nAnd jet to the flyest estate, relate take a break\nBreak down an eighth and then wait, drop it like Drake\nThugs they be booing and screwing, we canoeing\nClaim they doing the same shit we doing, fuck a union\nIt's the same style, RZA train a boy, jump the turnstile\nOn the island he tried to challenge God for the new bals\nEspecially that, aluminum bat in the Ac\nRelax, lay back, sell a grenade a day, it pays black\nThe Mac-10 flex wipe cats like Windex\nIndex finger be sore busting these fly scripts\nThe Wally kid count crazily grands with our plans\nLaying with my bitches and my mans in Lex Lands\nWe losing 'em, jet to the stash in Now Jerusalem\nAbusing 'em, rocking his jewels like we using 'em\nLow pro star, seven thick waves rock Polar\nRoll with the older Gods, build with the Sun, Moon and Star\n\nAll these MC's start realizing\nThat Ghost got that shit that'll keep you vibing\nThe Wu is here to bring you Shaolin's finest\nBut if your skills are weak you better step behind us\n\"Ghostface--Ghostface Killah!!\"\n\nMercury raps is roughed then God just shown like taps\nRed and white Wally's that match, bend my baseball hat\nDoing forever shit like pissing out the window on turnpikes\nRobbing niggas for leathers, high swiping on dirt bikes\nVoice be mellow like Vaughn Harper, Radio Barber\nMurder sleep away camp, the fly lady champ\nThe arsonist, who burn with his pen regardless\nSlaying all these earthlings and fake foreigners\nIn the Phillipines, pick herbal beans, bubbling strings\nBiochemical cream, we burn kerosene\nThe conviction of my tape is rape, wicked like Nixon\nBlond heads, inscriptions with three sixes in\nKiss the pyramid experiment with high explosive\nI slapbox with Jesus, lick shots at Joseph\nZoom in like binoculars, the rap blacksmith\nMoney's Rolex, was rockless, Chef ragtop is spotless\nI'm Iron Man no die-cast metal, I'm steel-alloy\nTrue identity hidden inside secret tabloids\nBreathe oxygen, both sides of my jaw carry oxes\nThe track hit like the bangers, in hundred watt boxes\nYo jostling these cats while Little J be deli-ing\nSip Irish Moss out of Widelians\n\"rhymes like retail, make sure shit sell\nFrom

pussy wounds\nLet the Gods build, pull up the grill\nCheck out the mad skills\nTop secret technique, too hard for you to peep it and keep it\nJiggy style of rap and watching knuckle slang sweep it\nOut of order tape recorder can't record my slaughter\nSpoil the rotten Donna too good to be forgotten\nHigh top notch, borderline rhymes is hand-cocked\nNinety-six, my ill sound clash is still

called him Lucas, he knew it\nFound himself the daughter of a kingpin\nThe ex of Tony Starks, it's a win-win\nHis seed, the grief filled up in his eyes\nHe kidnapped them both, for a scheme of revenge\nPillow cases over their heads, tossed in the Benz\nNo friends, no foes, only evil to expose\nLet's make a video\nTell Lu I got his grandson and daughter\nAnd I ain't lookin for no ransom\nI want revenge, I want blood, I want his head on a rug!\nI want him to watch me strangle his daughter\nButcher his babies, attack pits foamin out the mouth with rabies!\nM-80s stuffed in his ass cause bodily harm\nThis is just the fuckin tip of the storm!\nTell him to come! Tell him we need to speak man to mush!\nAs soon as he step in the building...Ambush\n\n\n\nAt day break, the Delucas made their way through the main gate\nQuietest cougars chasing wild gang prey\nThey cut through the chained fence up through the five escape steps\nThey raided the Kane gang \nThe look on Kane's face when he realized what was taken place\nHe was anticipating a payday, but he was faced with a melee\nHe sprained to his feet but his legs wouldn't stay straight\nAfraid, he reached for his piece, Bang Bang! Bang Bang!\nBut wait, as if on cue, the Deluca crew called out, \"Lucas!\"\nAnd began shooting unison, maneuvering from each of the rooms in pursuit of Kane\nBlew smoke and the cue dreamt irrefutable stench of mutilated flesh and the death of human beings!\nFinally it was over\nThe Delucas lowered their revolvers and put them back in their shoulder holsters\nThey shifted through the dead remains\nThe bedrooms, and the entry way\nWhere the hell is Lester Kane?!\n\nNow what is this that stands before me\nUnderneath his black cloth coughing\nIts Logan and her half breed offspring\nI got the nod from kane that ill be enforcing\nThis cruel source of my arbitration\nOminous calm with the calmest concentration\nThis job i take it with pride and consideration\nWith no problem i bring violence without wild provocation\nIm delivering deaths invitation\n? elevation will be the compensation for the confrontation\nThe deluca\u2019s get wiped out without complication\nIf something goes wrong and i have to\nIll step back and shoot\nIm the actual monster no zipper on the back of my suit\nMy squad is biblical but its backed by the truth\nGot worse schizophrenia than Jekyll and Hyde do\nThe menace weapon that\u2019s been cast out of heaven\nI hope the deluca\u2019s don\u2019t realize they\u2019ve been lied to\n\nKane's gang had no imply the Delucas had staked out the vacated building for eight days\nThey knew about his way in, the way out, the makeshift escape route\nThe hidden staircase, the way down to the basement in the safe house\nWhere to find Logan and her afraid child\nIn a dark corner where they were being held\nThey were blindfolded with taped mouths\nNo light or water, arms and legs bound\n\nBut there's a double cross of course, I'm hearing guns letting off from somewhere else\nI'm ready to get involved with the revolving  warehouse all by myself\nI dive underground finding rounds\n\nI am delivering death's invitation\nI am delivering death's invitation\nI am delivering death's invitation\nI am delivering death's invitation\nI am delivering death's invitation", "image":

of a kingpin\nThe ex of Tony Starks, it's a win-win\nHis seed, the grief filled up in his eyes\nHe kidnapped them both, for a scheme of revenge\nPillow cases over their heads, tossed in the Benz\nNo friends, no foes, only evil to expose\nLet's make a video\nTell Lu I got his grandson and daughter\nAnd I ain't lookin for no ransom\nI want revenge, I want blood, I want his head on a rug!\nI want him to watch me strangle his daughter\nButcher his babies, attack pits foamin out the mouth with rabies!\nM-80s stuffed in his ass cause bodily harm\nThis is just the fuckin tip of the storm!\nTell him to come! Tell him we need to speak man to mush!\nAs soon as he step in the building...Ambush\n\n\n\nAt day break, the Delucas made their way through the main gate\nQuietest cougars chasing wild gang prey\nThey cut through the chained fence up through the five escape steps\nThey raided the Kane gang \nThe look on Kane's face when he realized what was taken place\nHe was anticipating a payday, but he was faced with a melee\nHe sprained to his feet but his legs wouldn't stay straight\nAfraid, he reached for his piece, Bang Bang! Bang Bang!\nBut wait, as if on cue, the Deluca crew called out, \"Lucas!\"\nAnd began shooting unison, maneuvering from each of the rooms in pursuit of Kane\nBlew smoke and the cue dreamt irrefutable stench of mutilated flesh and the death of human beings!\nFinally it was over\nThe Delucas lowered their revolvers and put them back in their shoulder holsters\nThey shifted through the dead remains\nThe bedrooms, and the entry way\nWhere the hell is Lester Kane?!\n\nNow what is this that stands before me\nUnderneath his black cloth coughing\nIts Logan and her half breed offspring\nI got the nod from kane that ill be enforcing\nThis cruel source of my arbitration\nOminous calm with the calmest concentration\nThis job i take it with pride and consideration\nWith no problem i bring violence without wild provocation\nIm delivering deaths invitation\n? elevation will be the compensation for the confrontation\nThe deluca\u2019s get wiped out without complication\nIf something goes wrong and i have to\nIll step back and shoot\nIm the actual monster no zipper on the back of my suit\nMy squad is biblical but its backed by the truth\nGot worse schizophrenia than Jekyll and Hyde do\nThe menace weapon that\u2019s been cast out of heaven\nI hope the deluca\u2019s don\u2019t realize they\u2019ve been lied to\n\nKane's gang had no imply the Delucas had staked out the vacated building for eight days\nThey knew about his way in, the way out, the makeshift escape route\nThe hidden staircase, the way down to the basement in the safe house\nWhere to find Logan and her afraid child\nIn a dark corner where they were being held\nThey were blindfolded with taped mouths\nNo light or water, arms and legs bound\n\nBut there's a double cross of course, I'm hearing guns letting off from somewhere else\nI'm ready to get involved with the revolving  warehouse all by myself\nI dive underground finding rounds\n\nI am delivering death's invitation\nI am delivering death's invitation\nI am delivering death's invitation\nI am delivering death's invitation\nI am delivering death's invitation"}}, {"title": "Death\u2019s Invitation Interlude", "album": "Twelve Reasons To

wallet\n\nYo, I'm talking bags of heavy coke, bracelets on every men\nInnocent dope pushers, over night king pins\nIndeed, we smack niggas up for their cheese\nThrow bleach in yo face, got beef, let

like Paul Wall's\nLadies look out; they ain't thugs, they homo's\nThe film look hyper, when I clap 'em in slo mo'\nYa'll still paying the mob? We whip niggas out like waffle batter\nTheodore ancient with dart, flossin' them diamonds\nDiscussing our hits over a glass of scotch\nBaywatch bitches that ski, take turns when they hand us the twat\nThink not, we still run the trains, til the condom pop\nOn the low, we still fucking them cops\nPretty things from all precints, friday nights, we holding they Glocks\nThis is family, nigga, niggas can't stand me\nNext up, my little man, I hand you the jammy\n\nYou know the fam, what it is, it is what it is\nS.I.N.Y., where the animals live\nAss bet, niggas run in yo cribs\nI don't care if you blast for the cash, then scramble yo wig\nI'm like \"Damn, what a wonderful kid\"\nI could do what I want, doing dirt, not serving a bid\nYou know a real fam handle they biz, everybody get searched\nFrom the grandpops, down to the kids\nAnd my time, I'm officially here, tell ya man\nGo and start up ya car, start shifting the gears\nSun God got the pits for his ears, cuz niggas is scared\nHoping I don't let it blow in they ribs\nI said hot, niggas get robbed non stop\nOnce the gun cock, niggas strip down to they socks\nAnd my fam at the tippity top, I won't stop\nBelieve it or not, you and ya man is close targets\nJuks everything, dice games, mini markets\nFam gon' spark it, I'mma take whatever's in the pockets\nMostly the cash and the wallet, slide off the jewels\nCuz you shining, begets and the diamonds\nNever deny niggas with iron... YO!\n\nAiyo, chillin' with the Ceasar crew\nWe can smoke, all in the halls\nIt's how many niggas with guns, got 'em on\nAll tip top, cling to the fullest, mad bullets\nThis is a hobby, the lobby where they clap yo hoods\nGet the paper, word to everything, we a acre up\nBarbequin' like a mutt, we ain't taking nothing\nA high tech extremist, Gatorade, paid ya boy some money\nTo lay up on the low, swinging beamers\nI need to be an actor, but instead, I'd rather be in Hempstead\nAll of my bread came from crack barbers and shoppers\nSo much beef in these whoppers\nGuns that'll knock out floors and hit choppers\nWhat? What? The family remains, cuz it's grain\nIt's automatic, I live it and I claim it\nIt's real, come around here, you bought here\nYo, lay that half tape, then you will get wrapped real quick\n\nAiyo, we hug the block on President's Day\nSlinging all year round, gettin' that money the American way\nMight run up in yo wedding, grab the reverand and spray\nAnd let the shots for whatever they may\nThis is family, nigga, minus the mob size\nThe resurrection of Toney Starks & Trife Dies', starring in Part 5\nNiggas'll rather die when they're pride's in question\nTry'nna play hero, getting stuck for they prized possessions\nLook you staring in the eyes of oppression, that's why I ride with protection\nExtended clips, super sizing my weapons\nFive eleven, keep the heat tucked\nThat'll burn a hole thru ya stomach like acid reflux\nGet buried in ya cheap tux'\nWe make it hard for you niggas to keep up\nBeen thru a hundred towns, and running, beating the streets up\nCome up north in New York, down in Miami, pumping\nAt a table, breaking bread like a family\n\nFlorida, where we follow the code of the streets and\nBreaking the beats and, we taking the eats\nNever the least, we invading the streets\nShaking the beast, we familiar for life\nWe don't run, we grab knives, my double edged spit life\nMy dogs is real tight, shooting the dice\nSome of my fam might snatch ya ice\nGot family that go to church, come back like you don't work\nGot family that'll set you up, got family that chill, wanna spark the dutch\nWizard my fam, that stuck you up, I got fam that'll fuck you up\nChop you up, put your body in the back of the truck\nOsama Island, we been wilding, see the violence\nWe display talent, respect balance, nigga, Shaolin", "image":

steez\nPhilly, about to rebuild the nation\nThrough the knowledge of self, through education\n\nFreeze, motherfucker. Hands, hands, let me see your hands. Get out of the car. Get out of the fucking car. Get out, eat some fucking dirt. Get on the fucking ground\n\nI seen the police pull up, and rides hopped out\nPut your hand behind your back, you're guilty without a doubt\nWhat you mean, son? We built on this\nIllegal chokeholds, slap cuffs on my wrist\nI don't know what you talking about, boy, I'm the authority\nI'm just here to question up minority\nA thug drug pusher, violent man of deception\nAnd you just happen to fit the description\n\nNigga, you just another pawn in my chess game. I taught you everything you know, I run this motherfucking city. Think you gon' fuck everything up? You got the right to remain silent. Anything you say will be used against you in the court of law. (Faggot ass police nigga, man) Nigga, you're going away for a long time\n\nOkay, I got it, niggas just set me up\nDo their dirty work and thrown behind bars\nYou want wars? You got it - Tony ain't the one\nI told you before, I make murdering fun\nGotta swindle the kid, have me masking your enemies\nIt's all good in my chest, I got ten of these hearts\nAnd I vow for revenge\nTony don't stand for crumbs and fake friends\n\nIt's funny, only if niggas really knew\nGot the keys to the city, I could kill a whole crew\nPut the squeeze on the willy, get silly, go fool\nChop a nigga up, blame his body on his dude\nWhat it do? It's bigger than the boys in blue\nBeyond definition what this falls into\nM's in my optic, no ends to the profits\nJudges, prosecutors, politicians in my pocket\nHostage, high life, living on the edge\nToxic in hindsight, see me when I'm dead\nPledge, sworn in to serve and protect\nWhat a web, catch a neck, then I'm on to the next\nShit be booing, played out scripts, need a new one\nI dare a nigga doubt what I'm doing\nMoving, cash rules everything around me\nCrown me, I'm trying to squeeze blood out the county"}}, {"title": "Drama", "album": "Apollo Kids", "year": "2010-12-21", "lyrics": "Ayo, where the fuck is that blunt at?\nWhere y'all niggas hoggin' the shit, man?\nTwo pulls of that shit\u2014nigga start gettin paranoid and shh\nGet your fuckin, get your feet off my fuckin table nigga!\nFuck you think you at home, with your cheap fur on?\nShit look like it 'bout to bite somethin and shit nigga\n\nIt was the night before he got popped\nBig jars of haze, Cheech and Chong bong in the spot\nTropicana strawberries diced bananas the long dookie fifth\nNext to the Town House crackers Madden on, 2008, a G a game\nI'm Ron O'Neil the love seat sunk deep\nLil niggas bussin off they punk heat\nI'll make a massacre try to rob one of my donkeys\nBut I ain't wettin that\nI don't wanna send nobody back, violate me, take a nap\nPromise you got something lord that will honor you\nBlow your lil head off while you're tying your shoe\nBut back in the kitchen Pyrex's\nOccupied by the twins bank robbers with large records hard vests\n86 got guards on Benetton rugbies and frames that fake guns when they rob ????\nTo them that's natural actual play the squib God we gettin at you\nAnd we don't want to rap to you\nIt's not Kosher\nIt's not a code of La Costra Nostra to roast ya I get a little closer\nRock you to sleep like I got these little bitches come over\nHoping you falll for the bait thinking you safe\nHad that ass sweating like T.D.

and Chong bong in the spot\nTropicana strawberries diced bananas the long dookie fifth\nNext to the Town House crackers Madden on, 2008, a G a game\nI'm Ron O'Neil the love seat sunk deep\nLil niggas bussin off they punk heat\nI'll make a massacre try to rob one of my donkeys\nBut I ain't wettin that\nI don't wanna send nobody back, violate me, take a nap\nPromise you got something lord that will honor you\nBlow your lil head off while you're tying your shoe\nBut back in the kitchen Pyrex's\nOccupied by the twins bank robbers with large records hard vests\n86 got guards on Benetton rugbies and frames that fake guns when they rob ????\nTo them that's natural actual play the squib God we gettin at you\nAnd we don't want to rap to you\nIt's not Kosher\nIt's not a code of La Costra Nostra to roast ya I get a little closer\nRock you to sleep like I got these little bitches come over\nHoping you falll for the bait thinking you safe\nHad that ass sweating like T.D. Jakes\nI want the ones nigga you non believers you can ask your momma\nNow that's drama\n\nDollar icy from papi with the scraper Glock with the laser\nTrying my best not to pop yet but the drop is major\nShot my lil cuz I do my aunt the favor watch this\nI never been this itchy hope these cops just\nGet a doughnut urge and just splurge you bot he nerve to play third\nIn a softball tournament round my way say that's your word you bird\nI'll put your beak on a curb but anyway\nLooks like a good game the pigs ain't leaving so I'm a lay\nNice play just too bad it's your last\nCouple bundles

palming on a 40\nBroad day I'm trying to dodge a cover story\nLook like he stopping for gass I'm a pluck him yay\nThis had to be his most unlucky lucky day\n2 brothers come out of 7 Eleven in army wear and stand there\nActing like my tires need air\nHe closed the gas cap too many things going his way\nSo I just stashed that you probably think I'm bugging but hey\nI know them games in Lindsay Park is every Sunday he ain't going nowhere\nI went home switched gear went out and grabbed me a beer\n10 drinks later I'm at Burger King window for a Whopper\nLook left and see partner I hit the

breathe\nBut couldn't extract the chemicals from my body\nPoisonous lethal doses, comatosis\nIn and out of conscious, drugs is ferocious\nThe mass released the gas that simmered the soul\nSo my adrenaline stays level not out of control\nI been contaminated, physically altered\nGot wrong for doing right, my attitude salted\nI'm bitter, I clean up the community\nFuck these New York City cops, I don\u2019t need immunity\n\nFuck 911, private doctor on speed dial\nSlid to the aisle, fixed up the golden child\nExquisite doctor, his work of art\nCreated a gas mask to save Tony Starks\nFuck 911, private doctor on speed dial\nSlid to the aisle, fixed up the golden child\nExquisite doctor, his work of art\nCreated a gas mask to save Tony Starks\n\nI specialize in telekinesis, recognize the thesis\nThe leading expert on war and weaponized diseases\nThe brilliant Doctor X, no scientist is colder\nThe mask I made specifically protects you from Ebola\nIts destruction is impossible, totally irrelevant\nThe compounds are not found on the periodic table of elements\nAdamantium plus Vibranium\nThe force field that builds will shield your cranium\nIf anyone would try to place the mask upon their face\nThe mask will rupture\nIt's designed to match your molecular structure\nPlus the gold was to give it a touch of luster\nTo match the eagle bracelet and adjust to your repulsive thrusters\nBusta psychology, the wallaby that adapts to the environment\nThat's chameleon technology\nBut I digress, I must confess\nThe mask is unequivocally my best invention yet, Doctor X\n\nFuck 911, private doctor on speed dial\nSlid to the aisle, fixed up the golden child\nExquisite doctor, his work of art\nCreated a gas mask to save Tony Starks\nFuck 911, private doctor on speed dial\nSlid

lethal doses, comatosis\nIn and out of conscious, drugs is ferocious\nThe mass released the gas that simmered the soul\nSo my adrenaline stays level not out of control\nI been contaminated, physically altered\nGot wrong for doing right, my attitude salted\nI'm bitter, I clean up the community\nFuck these New York City cops, I don\u2019t need immunity\n\nFuck 911, private doctor on speed dial\nSlid to the aisle, fixed up the golden child\nExquisite doctor, his work of art\nCreated a gas mask to save Tony Starks\nFuck 911, private doctor on speed dial\nSlid to the aisle, fixed up the golden child\nExquisite doctor, his work of art\nCreated a gas mask to save Tony Starks\n\nI specialize in telekinesis, recognize the thesis\nThe leading expert on war and weaponized diseases\nThe brilliant Doctor X, no scientist is colder\nThe mask I made specifically protects you from Ebola\nIts destruction is impossible, totally irrelevant\nThe compounds are not found on the periodic table of elements\nAdamantium plus Vibranium\nThe force field that builds will shield your cranium\nIf anyone would try to place the mask upon their face\nThe mask will rupture\nIt's designed to match your molecular structure\nPlus the gold was to give it a touch of luster\nTo match the eagle bracelet and adjust to your repulsive thrusters\nBusta psychology, the wallaby that adapts to the environment\nThat's chameleon technology\nBut I digress, I must confess\nThe mask is unequivocally my best invention yet, Doctor X\n\nFuck 911, private doctor on speed dial\nSlid to the aisle, fixed up the golden child\nExquisite doctor, his work of art\nCreated a gas mask to save Tony Starks\nFuck 911, private doctor on speed dial\nSlid to the aisle, fixed up the golden child\nExquisite doctor,

enemies is out there son, tryna bring the ruckus\nKeep a tight circle, don't let her rain on your parade\nKeep doing what we're doing, getting money and getting paid\n\nIt's mind-boggling the heart wants it, the mind rejects it\nFuck the past, let's put the present in perspective\nThat's my lady, she would never back-stab or cross me\nStand butt-naked in the storm, sipping the frosty\nYou force

And if there's one thing I'm sure of\nIt's that drugs destroy your mind and destroy your home\nIn the end it'll only lead our country into ruin.\"\n\nWe eat fish, toss salads and make rap ballads\nThe biochemical slanglord'll throw the Arabs\nIn the dope fiend, vocal chords switch laser beams\nMy triple sevens broke the slot machines out in Queens\nGrey Poupon is Revlon rap, smack pawns, swing like batons\nMost my niggas smoke like Hillshire Farms\nCheck the gummy sole, underneath my shoe lies the tap\nThat attract bow-legged bitches with wide horse gaps\nIn steel mills Iron he'll smoke the blow on duns\nYou run errands, Primatene Mist is afraid of my lungs\nTurn my channel, it'll blow your whole bench off the panel\nLike eighty roman candles that backfired then slammed you\nEvery day is like a video shoot, check this shit\nI take it back to Playboy, stash guns in whips\nPicture afro picks, shish kabobs and dashikis\nThousands civil marched, raised their fists in early sixties\n\nNow check this one, you must have been stupid to miss this one\nDonna shogun-ing flip a ton of fashion\nDestination be the cash one, I step past one\nDon't make me blast one, I'm cold like Eskimo floe\nCappa villain stay chilling take shots of penicillin\nClean out and let the steam out, she fiend to blow out\nBut I'm equipped with mad white, Morris The Rap got nine lives\nI'll take a few hundred thousand dollar dives\nAnd then I still never go down\nUntil the last round I shine\nWhen RZA do his thing motherfucker, I'mma do mine\n\nNow, where I come from cats be carrying, marrying drug money\nFuck up your wife, get four to life\nCream we handling, Midtown niggas scrambling\nMove and examine the fly shit, plus quick to buy shit\nChef, yeah, you know the whole gods astral\nFidel Castro suits plus depositing cash rule\nBig time, play it like Canadian wine\nRZA's divine now, the sacredness of one's true mind\nNow let's get colorful like money green\nHigh roller coaster, Sosa, million dollar

all niggas eating\nRacquetball gangsters, unleash the law straight up\nColorful drawers, bad whores on the weekend\nEat it raw style like Flounder\nFucking with mine or how we design my niggas might find ya\nLaying in the Tropics, big dick shit on park\nThe way his Clarks look, niggas on topics\nMoving out, coloured Durangos, picture me broke\nThat's like picture rich niggas with the same coats\nOr rich niggas with the same coke\n\nYou can catch us cruising, balling a ship, fully equipped\nOn a StarTAC, calling a bitch, I'm what you get\nWhen that Absolut and Hennessy mix (Ultimate! Ultimate!)\nWu shit, my whole click (Ultimate! Ultimate!)\nRub-a-dub, ass in the club, showing me love\nSaying Peace to the nigga that thug, I got the drugs\nAnd the .38, snub-nose, striking a pose\nBaby girl spilled her drink on my clothes, the new Girbauds\nLouis Rich, Hot Nikks, nigga what's happening?\nAin't shit, holding my dick, smoking a clip, thanks for asking\nMashing, the latest fashion\nDance floor packed in, whites, blacks and latins\nAll in together, together for worse or better\nNow I put it down whether it's Methy, Method, or Meth-Tical\nRock, skate, roll, bounce\nI'm bound to wreck your body as they turn the party out\n\nAll magazines lay fly life we live\nThe lingo was to let y'all niggas know how niggas rep\nI'm set lighting the Purple in a new Lex\nTrifling work, let's murder everything that move on the set\n\nI better pay Big Mama for using his lyrics\n\nAnd my mouth stay dry cos I swallow the struggle\nI might connect you to a VCR after they plug you\nI'm not a gangster and I hate thugs too\nI'm just a nigga that paint a picture without a paintbrush too\nWithout a paintbrush too\n\nBulletproof Wallets, 20 G kitchens sets made out of Korea\nTop Sear, gots to be a lots to see a rocks\nKnots we re'd up behind the stove asking how Maria popped Lea\nCursed out Nia, burst out her purse\nWith the gods you jeer from Star's Pizzeria\nPeace hate to be ya, especially when them shots ring off\nIn slow motion when yo' head hit the meter\nYou lost two liters, at the same case speeder\nPeter slid through shook 'em down for his reefer\nJames chased Theresa with a hatchet on Easter\nTwo murders in the hood, we call it double features\nWatch how I eat this, freak the best teacher\nAfter prayer with the preacher, I get skied in the bleachers\nAnd your girl, I might eat her\nI'm a lover, not a biter\nI still catch her for a pizza\n\nYou can be as good as the rest of 'em or as bad as the worst\nSo don't hate me, you better move over yeah!\n\nYou fucking idiots!\nWallets motherfucker!\nAll my shit is bulletproof\nBulletproof projects, bulletproof wallets\nR.A.G.U., you heard, you bird-ass niggas\nY'all niggas ain't got a chance"}}, {"title": "Forever", "album": "Ghostdini: Wizard of Poetry

know baby, I hope it ('last, forever')\nSo I, took off my paisley pajamas I got from St. Thomas\nYo, I love you so much, so let me pay homage\nAnd if you do, yo I promise never break a promise\nSo can I give you the honors my little Pocahontas?\nPlay by play, Miss Camay\nYou like a Zales Diamond in the window, right on display\nYou just a shining, precised in every curve you cut\nAnd for your daddy, yo, you never have to tuck in your gut\nBecause I love it like that, stretchmark fat, plus let me show my crunches\nTo burn it off, just lay right on your back\nAnd let me do my love dance, I pop it to the left\nI pop it to the right, I get it all night, come on\n\nThem other chicks must hail to the queen, as I\nPut them dudes straight up and check, cuz the queen is mine\n(Last, forever, last, forever)\nWe can be broke, holes in our coat, even still we shine\nWe got each other through the bad and the best of time\n(Last, forever, last, forever)\n\nYo, yo, I'm lost in love, with nowhere to go\nShe says I'm a pain in the ass, boy, get to the store\nShe can say that, cuz we best friends, we play together\nShe carry my left rib, therefore we pray together\nBury me on top of her, in our graves together\nCuz when she feel pain, I know how to make it better\nTalks, some long walks, communication in parks\nUnderstand what she's going through, our listen was smarts\nEspecially when she's on her friend, I be hoping it leave\nI have to bite my tongue, just to keep from arguing\nSix days of that is like, who let the monster in\nAfter it's finished then, I can get on top again\nShorty girl's my oxygen, never catch her gossiping\nLook it ya'll, this my flower, she gon' keep on blossiming\nLong as she is mine, and I am her, we gon' ride the wind\nThis lady here is all

hope it ('last, forever') I know baby, I hope it ('last, forever')\nSo I, took off my paisley pajamas I got from St. Thomas\nYo, I love you so much, so let me pay homage\nAnd if you do, yo I promise never break a promise\nSo can I give you the honors my little Pocahontas?\nPlay by play, Miss Camay\nYou like a Zales Diamond in the window, right on display\nYou just a shining, precised in every curve you cut\nAnd for your daddy, yo, you never have to tuck in your gut\nBecause I love it like that, stretchmark fat, plus let me show my crunches\nTo burn it off, just lay right on your back\nAnd let me do my love dance, I pop it to the left\nI pop it to the right, I get it all night, come on\n\nThem other chicks must hail to the queen, as I\nPut them dudes straight up and check, cuz the queen is mine\n(Last, forever, last, forever)\nWe can be broke, holes in our coat, even still we shine\nWe got each other through the bad and the best of time\n(Last, forever, last, forever)\n\nYo, yo, I'm lost in love, with nowhere to go\nShe says I'm a pain in the ass, boy, get to the store\nShe can say that, cuz we best friends, we play together\nShe carry my left rib, therefore we pray together\nBury me on top of her, in our graves together\nCuz when she feel pain, I know how to make it better\nTalks, some long walks, communication in parks\nUnderstand what she's going through, our listen was smarts\nEspecially when she's on her friend, I be hoping it leave\nI have to bite my tongue, just to keep from arguing\nSix days of that is like, who let the monster in\nAfter it's finished then, I can get on top again\nShorty girl's my oxygen, never catch her gossiping\nLook it ya'll, this my flower, she gon' keep on blossiming\nLong as she is mine, and I am her, we gon' ride the wind\nThis lady here is all for me, I never have to lock her in"}}, {"title": "Get the Money", "album": "Twelve Reasons To Die II", "year": "2015-06-22", "lyrics": "Get the money, we out here to pillage and loot\nCrack safes, watch DeLucas' blood gettin' spilled\nYou can't take over the truth behind the story\nLet Ghost legend live on in all its glory\nGet the money, we out here to pillage and loot\nCrack safes, watch DeLucas' blood gettin' spilled\nYou can't take over the truth behind the story\nLet Ghost legend live on in all its glory\n\nYo, yo\nGet the money, they keep it tucked away in a safe\nIn the back room by the wine bottles and grapes\nHit 'em where it hurts, they can't find shit and they broke\nSnatch chains, wallets, bitches, fur coats\nTear the clubs up, all social events\nIf a nigga act tense put a hole in his fence\nThis ain't for fun but it's fun though\nI gotta run though\nMoney ain't shit and watch me burn a few hundo\nTear the DeLucas down like the legend of Tone Starks\nTie bricks around his ankles, have him swimmin' with sharks\nDynamite they safe, lookin' for heirlooms\nIt's personal, I want the keys to the tombs\nKids college funds, crack the foundation\nConnects to the banks and the police station\nI want those faces rolled, truth behind the legend\nDid it really go down, or it's just my obsession?\n\nGet the money, we out here to pillage and loot\nCrack safes, watch DeLucas' blood gettin' spilled\nYou can't take over the truth behind the story\nLet Ghost legend live on in all its glory\nGet the money, we out here to pillage and

ours\nMoney, power, and the powder I would murder with y'all\nIn the name of King Kane \"New York, New York!\"\nThe city of dreams, stained sidewalks, and Mac 10s black as my fist\nSearch 'til it hurt, records from the wretched abyss\nMurdered them, they scurred, wreck him 'til he wreckin' his shit\nIf he alludin' his life worth losin'\nKane said a record earned is a pot of gold\nPrize a loan, put a marble floor in my momma home\nNever need a loan, put the rest in the bank\nWe a army, only thing we missin' a tank\nCouldn't harm me, keeper is my brother for the record\nI'm a crazy muthafucka, blood stains on my knuckles\nI'm a slugger, fist kill his brain\nLoad up a weapon in the name of King Lester Kane\n\nGet the money, we out here to pillage and loot\nCrack safes, watch DeLucas' blood gettin' spilled\nYou can't take over the truth behind the story\nLet Ghost legend live on in all its glory\nGet the money, we out here to pillage and loot\nCrack safes, watch DeLucas' blood gettin' spilled\nYou can't take over the truth behind the story\nLet Ghost legend live on in all its glory\n\nHey yo\nWe crushed 'em, last spot left on the list\nCrack the safe and peeled out twelve sealed discs\nLookin' illmatic, wrapped up in a robe\nThey were records, each one marked with a code\nIt said \"Do Not Play\" in big bold letters\nThe DeLucas pressed, stamped, engraved Vendettas\nI think we hit it, ressurection of Ghostface\nShoulda known they had that shit hidden at Tone's place\nHit Logan, sip chilled Don Maretta\nBig glasses of wine bringin' sharp chedda\nGet the vinyl to headquarters, ASCAP codes\nAnd tell Lester we hit the mother of all loads\nPagin' 911, meet back at the burghs\nThey gonna want revenge on the squad and all that space\nWe crippled 'em, but they go deeper than white meat\nWe got blood on our hands and war in the streets\n\nGet the money, we out here to pillage and loot\nCrack safes, watch DeLucas' blood gettin' spilled\nYou can't take over the truth behind the story\nLet Ghost legend live on in all its glory\nGet the money, we out here to pillage and loot\nCrack safes, watch DeLucas' blood gettin' spilled\nYou can't take over the truth behind the story\nLet Ghost legend live on in all its glory", "image": "https://images.genius.com/acf47354b3403ad918031650402ae958.1000x1000x1.jpg", "artist": "Ghostface Killah", "raw":

story\nLet Ghost legend live on in all its glory\nGet the money, we out here to pillage and loot\nCrack safes, watch DeLucas' blood gettin' spilled\nYou can't take over the truth behind the story\nLet Ghost legend live on in all its glory\n\nDay dream of a Ruger to the Luger 'til the city is ours\nMoney, power, and the powder I would murder with y'all\nIn the name of King Kane \"New York, New York!\"\nThe city of dreams, stained sidewalks, and Mac 10s black as my fist\nSearch 'til it hurt, records from the wretched abyss\nMurdered them, they scurred, wreck him 'til he wreckin' his shit\nIf he alludin' his life worth losin'\nKane said a record earned is a pot of gold\nPrize a loan, put a marble floor in my momma home\nNever need a loan, put the rest in the bank\nWe a army, only thing we missin' a tank\nCouldn't harm me, keeper is my brother for the record\nI'm a crazy muthafucka, blood stains on my knuckles\nI'm a slugger, fist kill his brain\nLoad up a weapon in the name of King Lester Kane\n\nGet the money, we out here to pillage and loot\nCrack safes, watch DeLucas' blood gettin' spilled\nYou can't take over the truth behind the story\nLet Ghost legend live on in all its glory\nGet the money, we out here to pillage and loot\nCrack safes, watch DeLucas' blood gettin' spilled\nYou can't take over the truth behind the story\nLet Ghost legend live on in all its glory\n\nHey yo\nWe crushed 'em, last spot left on the list\nCrack the safe and peeled out twelve sealed discs\nLookin' illmatic, wrapped up in a robe\nThey were records, each one marked with a code\nIt said \"Do Not Play\" in big bold letters\nThe DeLucas pressed, stamped, engraved Vendettas\nI think we hit it, ressurection of Ghostface\nShoulda known they had that shit hidden at Tone's place\nHit Logan, sip chilled Don Maretta\nBig glasses of wine bringin' sharp chedda\nGet the vinyl to headquarters, ASCAP codes\nAnd tell Lester we hit the mother of all loads\nPagin' 911, meet back at the burghs\nThey gonna want revenge on the squad and all that space\nWe crippled 'em, but they go deeper than white meat\nWe got blood on our hands and war in the streets\n\nGet the money, we out here to pillage and loot\nCrack safes, watch DeLucas' blood gettin' spilled\nYou can't take over the truth behind the story\nLet Ghost legend live on in all its glory\nGet the money, we out here to pillage and loot\nCrack safes, watch DeLucas' blood gettin' spilled\nYou can't take over the truth behind the story\nLet Ghost legend live on in all its glory"}}, {"title": "Ghetto", "album": "Apollo

your corny debates\nI'm like cake or maybe like ten thousand dollar rabbits\nThe kid walked through, switch up his accent, now I'm from Paris\nCash the bill, frozen elements in gold\nSigns from the

A-yo, fuck this\nA-yo, how can I move the crowd?\nFirst of all, ain't no mistakes allowed\nHere's the instructions, put it together\nIt's simple ain't it?

good, plus my face was good\nThe way I wear my jeans up over my boots is hood\nAnd my cash is good, the grass, spread it out, over the hash is good\nThe grasp who be hypecast is good\nThat's the bird that fucked the game up\nCut the head off lames and platinum niggas, your boy done came up\nGot my aim up, favorite bling with a millennium chains\nChilling, in the staircase, surrounded by killings\nWith bank rolls, bang those, bang your main hoes\nYou was in love with the pussy, it ain't the same though\nCuz I'm good, she's good, so you should be good\nHit her with the stiff one, she callin' me wood\nAnd we don't love those hoes, with they flat butts caked up\nAnd tipped up toes, need an ill plastic surgeon to fix they nose\nCuz they shit is too fat like an adidas sole\nDon't even touch my gold, I'm good\n\nI know you heard it a thousand times\nNot quite like my design\nYou say that's what you looking for\nGator boots walk through the door, now\n\n(Good) Theodore's good,

murders, slick gun material\nBurnt up bodies that rock with no burial\nHammers that hardly work, go to work\nLike a slave on a hot day, with no water\nBlow you for props, in the cop's face, might get knocked up\nJakes that play hero, they can get popped up\nFace fallin' off they cheekbone, gotta take meat\nFrom they ass, to sow it back, I'm a beast, holmes\nIt's ground beef, in the streets, so we street's clone\nLike fresh fruit, from a tree, so the heat's blown\nYour momma missing, your boys are crying\nCut ya balls out your nutsack, the chinks are buying\nShit bags is like gift bags, you get it for free\nIf you master fronting, classic cutting\nYou keep stunting, them gem star'll rip something\nLook homey, it's the bloody sweepstakes\nGlove club you down in the club, how you like that, sweet cakes?\n\nYo, it was a minute after twelve, when the tragedy struck\nNiggas emptied on son, and left 'em leaning right in Valerie's truck\nThe red Cherokee blood was pouring out his head heavily\nThe only motive for murder was wetter, either jealousy\nThey found him slumped over the wheel, horn blowing\nBullet holes showing, property stolen, motor still going\nDriving side door, waves scoping, the window is broken\nGlass back and shredded his grill, his collar was soaking\nHe probably knew the killas, cause they jinxed him with ease\nCops hold the perimeter, thirsty, looking for leads\nKnocking on doors, questioning tenants, the lieutenant\nWas the first to arrive on the scene, he knew he was finished\nDeWayne Roberts knew him in college, mid-twenties\nStopped being brolic, V.A. driver's license in his wallet\nThe last call on his mobile phone was back to home\nSorry, Miss Amonia's son was found dead with two in his dome\n\nThis be the bird's eye view of things, look how we doing things\nWe stick niggas up and we take they rings\nMission Impossible, Theodore Unit, we unstoppable\nSpit razors out of our mouth and start chopping you\nBank robbers, blood jakes out with the obstacle\nRopes hanging down from the roof, my parachute\nSoaking water, heat smoking, we scrape and we Pillage, man\nWherever we broke in, Theodore, pulverize\nBoat rides and tours, smashed 'em in the crib with they coconut straws\nDudes step off the scene, black face and four-four\nThe CREAM that we stack up, cake and whores\n\nCash in abundance, the cats that I run with\nGot gats at a motel, and splashed by the hundreds\nI don't ask if I want it, my attitude is running\nI don't ask if I want it, my attitude is running, yup\nMega ice neck, with some fish, with some fish dishes\nRakim gems, my mind shine is what my weight misses\nAnything else is uncivilized, send the kind of niggas\nA tremendous spy, you can see the venom by\nMy nine leave a ten to buy, I don't need my men to ride\nI'm in the moshing squad, beside the car that's highly energized\nBeen advised, before, that fucking with I, is genocide\nMany men have died, from playing games from what they feel inside\nBrawl with it in me, put it on my enemy\nBe warned, defending me, like killing off a Kennedy\nI silly song M.C.'s get sent on base\nType of nigga spit the Remy or laugh in ya face\nThis dig in my waste, is mastery, step out of place\nShatter that ass, like glass, and break fast like a neglige\nPlay with the biscuit, dick, don't even risk it\nI, snatch up my misses, and dash on the

stuck together\nOn some Siamese shit... yo\n\nYo, classic murders, slick gun material\nBurnt up bodies that rock with no burial\nHammers that hardly work, go to work\nLike a slave on a hot day, with no water\nBlow you for props, in the cop's face, might get knocked up\nJakes that play hero, they can get popped up\nFace fallin' off they cheekbone, gotta take meat\nFrom they ass, to sow it back, I'm a beast, holmes\nIt's ground beef, in the streets, so we street's clone\nLike fresh fruit, from a tree, so the heat's blown\nYour momma missing, your boys are crying\nCut ya balls out your nutsack, the chinks are buying\nShit bags is like gift bags, you get it for free\nIf you master fronting, classic cutting\nYou keep stunting, them gem star'll rip something\nLook homey, it's the bloody sweepstakes\nGlove club you down in the club, how you like that, sweet cakes?\n\nYo, it was a minute after twelve, when the tragedy struck\nNiggas emptied on son, and left 'em leaning right in Valerie's truck\nThe red Cherokee blood was pouring out his head heavily\nThe only motive for murder was wetter, either jealousy\nThey found him slumped over the wheel, horn blowing\nBullet holes showing, property stolen, motor still going\nDriving side door, waves scoping, the window is broken\nGlass back and shredded his grill, his collar was soaking\nHe probably knew the killas, cause they jinxed him with ease\nCops hold the perimeter, thirsty, looking for leads\nKnocking on doors, questioning tenants, the lieutenant\nWas the first to arrive on the scene, he knew he was finished\nDeWayne Roberts knew him in college, mid-twenties\nStopped being brolic, V.A. driver's license in his wallet\nThe last call on his mobile phone was back to home\nSorry, Miss Amonia's son was found dead with two in his dome\n\nThis be the bird's eye view of things, look how we doing things\nWe stick niggas up and we take they rings\nMission Impossible, Theodore Unit, we unstoppable\nSpit razors out of our mouth and start chopping you\nBank robbers, blood jakes out with the obstacle\nRopes hanging down from the roof, my parachute\nSoaking water, heat smoking, we scrape and we Pillage, man\nWherever we broke in, Theodore, pulverize\nBoat rides and tours, smashed 'em in the crib with they coconut straws\nDudes step off the scene, black face and four-four\nThe CREAM that we stack up, cake and whores\n\nCash in abundance, the cats that I run with\nGot gats at a motel, and splashed by the hundreds\nI don't ask if I want it, my attitude is running\nI don't ask if I want it, my attitude is running, yup\nMega ice neck, with some fish, with some fish dishes\nRakim gems, my mind shine is what my weight misses\nAnything else is uncivilized, send the kind of niggas\nA tremendous spy, you can see the venom by\nMy nine leave a ten to buy, I don't need my men to ride\nI'm in the moshing squad, beside the car that's highly energized\nBeen advised, before, that fucking with I, is genocide\nMany men have died, from playing games from what they feel inside\nBrawl with it in me, put it on my enemy\nBe warned, defending me, like killing off a Kennedy\nI silly song M.C.'s get sent on base\nType of nigga spit the Remy or laugh in ya face\nThis dig in my waste, is mastery, step out of place\nShatter that ass, like glass, and break fast like a neglige\nPlay with the biscuit, dick, don't even risk it\nI, snatch up my misses, and dash on the interstate"}}, {"title": "Handcuffin' Them Hoes", "album": "Apollo Kids", "year": "2010-12-21", "lyrics": "Yeah, yeah\nYeah I cheat and I

the dirt, it'll mean so much\nI said I got this, message received\nI'mma clean up the block like you wouldn't believe\nCall me Mr. Clean, aka Starkiano\nNine years later slid across the Verrazano\nClean sweep, apply pressure to the scum\nThis is my town, Stapleton is where I'm from\nThird shot slapped in the head with a juice box\nGrenade with no pin in his mouth, this is my block\nAnd Bamboo fucking with this is absurd\nI'mma handle my bee's wax, that's my word\n\nCame up out the darkness, searching for light\nI know home is where my heart is\nAnd now nothing seems right\nI tried to make peace and cut my losses\nAnd carry on somehow\nBut I've come much too far, man\nToo late to turn back now, here I go again\nHere I go again\nHere I go again\nHere I go again\n\n9 joints, my nigga you\u2019re home\nStreets is different\n\nYeah, yeah, welcome home Starks\nRemember us at the jams in the parks?\nOlde Gold guzzlers, Wallabee Clarks\nYoung cold hustlers, obviously sharp\nVoom with the purpose to bloom, so in tune\nDialogue like Disciples in the circle of goons\nMy ace boon, then you got sent to the tombs\nAnd shit went left, had to pinch my flesh\nAnd figure some other scheme to get cream, reign supreme\nYou know everything ain't what it seem\nSo I switched up size, had to switch up lives\nNow I can fuck life and rip her thighs\nA badge and a gun that's legal, it's more lethal\nThan any local dealer that's evil leading peoples\nThe sequel, me and you both could split a loaf\nJust need you a little closer\nYou could squeeze that toast\nAnd knock off targets, starting with the hardest\nBy next year my nigga, we be the largest\nFelonies done with no charges", "image":

full of bad news\nYour block is corrupt and it's time to choose\nWe got some niggas running drugs that can't be touched\nUnless you wanna' handle the dirt, it'll mean so much\nI said I got this, message received\nI'mma clean up the block like you wouldn't believe\nCall me Mr. Clean, aka Starkiano\nNine years later slid across the Verrazano\nClean sweep, apply pressure to the scum\nThis is my town, Stapleton is where I'm from\nThird shot slapped in the head with a juice box\nGrenade with no pin in his mouth, this is my block\nAnd Bamboo fucking with this is absurd\nI'mma handle my bee's wax, that's my word\n\nCame up out the darkness, searching for light\nI know home is where my heart is\nAnd now nothing seems right\nI tried to make peace and cut my losses\nAnd carry on somehow\nBut I've come much too far, man\nToo late to turn back now, here I go again\nHere I go again\nHere I go again\nHere I go again\n\n9 joints, my nigga you\u2019re home\nStreets is different\n\nYeah, yeah, welcome home Starks\nRemember us at the jams in the parks?\nOlde Gold guzzlers, Wallabee Clarks\nYoung cold hustlers, obviously sharp\nVoom with the purpose to bloom, so in tune\nDialogue like Disciples in the circle of goons\nMy ace boon, then you got sent to the tombs\nAnd shit went left, had to pinch my flesh\nAnd figure some other scheme to get cream, reign supreme\nYou know everything ain't what it seem\nSo I switched up size, had to switch up lives\nNow I can fuck life and rip her thighs\nA badge and a gun that's legal, it's more lethal\nThan any local dealer that's evil leading peoples\nThe sequel, me and you both could split a loaf\nJust need you a little closer\nYou could squeeze that toast\nAnd knock off targets, starting with the hardest\nBy next year my nigga, we be the largest\nFelonies done with no charges"}}, {"title": "Hidden Darts", "album": "Hidden Darts: Special Edition", "year": "2007-03-13", "lyrics": "One-two, one-two, yo\nWhat the fuck is the deal, it's

Don?\nI'm James Bond, in the Octagon, with two razors\nBet ya'll didn't know I had a fake arm, I lost it\nWild in war, before rap, I was gettin' it on\nChoke a fat nigga out in like forty seconds, my gun get hard\nWith a .45 steel erection\nEagle on, Kangol hat slanted, coconut, bounce to Morocco\nGuerilla medallions, like Flava Flav clock, yo\nNiggas want me dead, but they scared to step to me\nRip they guts out, like a hysterectomy\nWhen beef collide, look on the flip, buy a penitentiary kite\nOr get you bumped off from the inside\nJaws is hanging, frauds is lifting\nThey drawers on the floor complaining\nBird ass nigga, resemble, Keenen Ivory Wayans\nStay in your place, dirt bomb rappers get shadowboxed\nFor training, ya'll still eating bacon...\n\"Hidden Darts\"\n\"Hidden Darts\"\n\nYo, I've done walked on fire (fire), never got burnt (burnt)\nSlept on glass (glass), never got cut (cut)\nAnd broke a few nose bones, yo, light off a round or two\nAt certain dudes where they dropped they phones\nYo this straight crack (yeah), even my hand got tooken to jail\nFor writing murder, my wrist couldn't take it in bail\nThen left my fingers for dead, told 'em\n\"I ain't have nothing to do with the writing\"\nI hold you down when you be squeezing that lead\nShopping sprees, with my mans on the corner watch D's\nRolling in threes, in them purple capri's'\nA gritty bop, my rocks is bigger, wallo's with the gold tassels\nYour old slave, with Starkey Love on the shackle\nAnd I stay fly underwater, my toes is iced out\nPoofed the nails off, ya faggots can figure the price out\nIt's chump change, ya'll bitch niggas go get my coco\nGet my slippers, before I go gun ho!\n\"Hidden Darts\"\n\"Hidden Darts\"\n\nYa'll niggas hold your fucking necks\nBefore you put them shits

know I had a fake arm, I lost it\nWild in war, before rap, I was gettin' it on\nChoke a fat nigga out in like forty seconds, my gun get hard\nWith a .45 steel erection\nEagle on, Kangol hat slanted, coconut, bounce to Morocco\nGuerilla medallions, like Flava Flav clock, yo\nNiggas want me dead, but they scared to step to me\nRip they guts out, like a hysterectomy\nWhen beef collide, look on the flip, buy a penitentiary kite\nOr get you bumped off from the inside\nJaws is hanging, frauds is lifting\nThey drawers on the floor complaining\nBird ass nigga, resemble, Keenen Ivory Wayans\nStay in your place, dirt bomb rappers get shadowboxed\nFor training, ya'll still eating bacon...\n\"Hidden Darts\"\n\"Hidden Darts\"\n\nYo, I've done walked on fire (fire), never got burnt (burnt)\nSlept on glass (glass), never got cut (cut)\nAnd broke a few nose bones, yo, light off a round or two\nAt certain dudes where they dropped they phones\nYo this straight crack (yeah), even my hand got tooken to jail\nFor writing murder, my wrist couldn't take it in bail\nThen left my fingers for dead, told 'em\n\"I ain't have nothing to do with the writing\"\nI hold you down when you be squeezing that lead\nShopping sprees, with my mans on the corner watch D's\nRolling in threes, in them purple capri's'\nA gritty bop, my rocks is bigger, wallo's with the gold tassels\nYour old slave, with Starkey Love on the shackle\nAnd I stay fly underwater, my toes is iced out\nPoofed the nails off, ya faggots can figure the price out\nIt's chump change, ya'll bitch niggas go get my coco\nGet my slippers, before I go gun ho!\n\"Hidden Darts\"\n\"Hidden Darts\"\n\nYa'll niggas hold your fucking necks\nBefore you put them shits to sleep\nYou know what I mean, daddy\nIt's real like that, coming at all ya'll niggas this year\nI gots to come for that title, baby, I don't give a fuck who holding it\nYouknowhatimean? Tone on the come up\nYouknowhatimean, I'm playing on ya'll niggas, man\nSo yo, ya'll niggas know what the fuck time it is and shit\nSlow the fuck down, nigga, throw this shit in, it's real...\n\"Hidden Darts\""}}, {"title": "Holla", "album": "The Pretty Toney Album", "year": "2004-04-20", "lyrics": "I'm from a place where fish was made\nCordoroy Baley's, sportin' those Rakim caves\nRakeem came, high self esteem promised me\nA moment in life, just to wreck yall lames\nThrow the Tec to your brain, puttin' the best to shame\nThis is Theodore, best to tuck those Dana Dane's\nSee me comin' (blaow!) start runnin' and (blaow! blaow!)\nAiyo...

just to wreck yall lames\nThrow the Tec to your brain, puttin' the best to shame\nThis is Theodore, best to tuck those Dana Dane's\nSee me comin' (blaow!) start runnin' and (blaow! blaow!)\nAiyo... (blaow! blaow! blaow!)\nWho them fly niggas when we walk through the party\nPimp talk with the Mac strapped to our body\nBartender's nervous, afraid to serve us, bad service\nUn smacked him on purpose and see this drunk come and berp us\nPaper chasers, Starky stayed up in the makings\nTheodore conquer the four devils wit the patience\nCellphones is blowin', the crews not available\nAsk 'Donna, word in the town, we the realest dudes\nWe don't need no diamond rings\nAll we need is a drum, like, fuck it, he can rhyme, I'll sing\nAnd in my Yankee hat, you can drop five beans\nAnd then run back to momma, like, all I know is..\n\nHolla holla holla.. if you want to, I love you (I love you)\nHolla holla holla if you want to, I love you (I love you)\n\nWhen I walk through any function\nYou bet your ass that the 4/5'll cook, fuck your wack looks\nFuck platinum, fuck, let me show ya'll crooks\nThis is legit rap, I.R.S. can suck my books\nI'm a family man, Clan mixed with Theodore\nMy boots hang over the telephone wires on Broad'\nWord to MetLife, Tony got insurance on his mics\nSmoke mad shit and still got endurance when he fight\nBoth hands clusty, bank account dusty!\nEver, say, my name, again, you pussy!\nLike, an angry, cripple, man, don't push me!\nDon't believe the kid, listen to me..\n\n\nDirty told me to rock the spot (yeah)\nFreak the beats cuz the streets is raw (go 'head)\nDon't believe what you see, just watch (true)\nSpeak to the seeds, give 'em lead on jobs (come on)\nEducate, keep it peace wit Gods (that's right)\nIn return, happiness in globs (yeah)\nWe see the future like a psychic's palm\n\nThe things I'm saying are true\nAnd the way I explain them to you, yes to you\nListen to me"}}, {"title": "Homicide", "album": "36 Seasons", "year": "2014-12-09", "lyrics": "This nigga Tony think he back? Fuck that, I'ma fold niggas\nMake a mothafuckin' example out him, I'ma show niggas\nAround the way I done told them niggas\nFuck the OGs, we got the same type of guns as them older niggas\nI know he killed the dawg so I'm holdin' grudge\nIt's a homi' on any and everybody that he love\nHold up, there go his man Mick\nIn the car with his kids, I'ma split his mothafuckin' wig\nFollow him to the crib and park up the block\nGo in the trunk, grab my mothafuckin' 40 Glock\nOn my way thinkin' this nigga gotta get it\nI'ma empty out the clip so that Tony gets the message\nKick in the door, started lettin' off\nMick fell through the table, got wrapped up in the tablecloth\nSkated off in the darkness of night\nLeft my callin' card on the body and said \"fuck your life\"\n\nShit is brutal, I gotta get made then bounce\n36 seasons, I'm stuck back on the couch\nLike a potato, I don't play though\nI'm stone cold son, these lames is built like Play-Doh\nI seen Mick's body on the floor covered in sheets\nAnd a note that says I'm a dead man walkin'\nAn empty soul just headed for the coffin\nThis is crazy, they took my brother, they must be clueless\nI'ma get that mothafucka, I'm ruthless\nRelentless,  than a dusted out Navy Seal\nI'ma skin him alive, that's for real\nI ain't goin' nowhere, they let the beast out the cage\nThe face of a killer, straight up, on a rampage\nWar path, blood bath, a killing spree\nI'ma show these mothafuckas how it's meant to be\n x2\nAyo go against the grain, I smell a massacre\nI'll stick a bomb in your limo, blow up your passengers\nKill every one of 'em, leave no witnesses\nTime for revenge, now live out your sentences\n\nI ain't goin' nowhere\nI ain't goin' nowhere\nY'all mothafuckas comin' for my head?\nThis is Tony Starks, you can't stop me, mothafucka\nNigga I wipe my dick on your spaghetti fork, nigga\nI'm gettin' this money, nigga, for life, nigga, forever\nAnd I ain't talkin' 'bout shoebox money neither, nigga",

don, the face of a killer\nThe voice of the past and presence, I speak thrillers\nRock the purple robe, crush them with 24 karat gold\nThe chain is chunky like the neck of a monkey\nGlass slipper, my wallows is made from lion skin\nKing of the jungle, ain't shit about me humble\nRock a black panther hoodie, nigga, made from panther skin\nI'm black on the outside and black within\nThe hood superhero, the motherfucking Don Dada\nThe Don Wilson, nigga, I do what I gotta\nI'm a boss, them DeLucas trying to front on my skin tone\nI left the fam to start a fam of my own\nA black Italiano, big pinky rings from Sicily\nI move like the don of the fam, it\u2019s officially\nWar time, Starky on some black avengers\nShadowboxing with killers that move like ninjas\n\nI declare war, war on the DeLucas\nBulletproof jet planes, nigga, you can't shoot us\nCan't stop my reign or terrorize the power\nTone Starks, new king of this crown, y'all better cower\nWar, war on the DeLucas\nBulletproof jet planes, nigga, you can't shoot us\nCan't stop my reign or terrorize the power\nTone Starks, new king of this crown, y'all better cower\n\nI'm prepared to go to war for the battle of supremacy\nThere's nothing now to remedy this decision\nThe only thing left is the loyalty of the family\n\u2018Cause once we establish the power they gon' turn sour\nAnd use everything in their power to shut us down\nWe've come to far to turn around, Tone\nGot a new connect, Don Stone\nFlew his private jet from Rome to talk business\nHe heard about your crime saga poems looking to invest millions\nIt's up to you Tone, this move can make us both rich\nThe crew is armed, cocked, and ready to rock steady\nIt's non-stop hustling, flow of their own casino, RZA Tarantino\nIt's Wu Gambino for life, you know how we go\nAnd to the last breath blow, mi amigo\n\nI declare war, war on the DeLucas\nBulletproof jet planes, nigga, you can't shoot us\nCan't stop my reign or terrorize the power\nTone Starks, new king of this crown, y'all better cower\nWar, war on the DeLucas\nBulletproof jet planes, nigga, you can't shoot us\nCan't stop my reign or terrorize the power\nTone Starks, new king of this crown, y'all better cower\n\nBorn into a world where violence, death and destruction surrounded him at every turn. Tony Starks took control of his own destiny and aspired to become one of the foremost leaders of the criminal underworld. Regardless of his will, and the ability to run the streets with invincibility, there were still those who chose to stand in his way"}}, {"title": "I'll Be That", "album": "Ghostdini: Wizard of Poetry in Emerald City", "year": "2009-09-29", "lyrics": "I could be your friend, I could be your tease\nI can be a freak, I can be a P.Y.T\nIf you ask, I'll be that\nI could be your girl, I could be your wife\nI complete your side, I could be watching me\nIf you ask, I'll be that\nI'll be your homey, lover, friend, I'll be your everything\nIf you ask, I'll be that\nSay you want me, I'll come running\nI can be your baby, just you ask, I'll be that\n\nMy girl, my love, come through, rescue me\nThrow me on the bed, no clothes, wrestle me\nAfter smashing that, then will you cook for me\nPromise I won't hit you, you don't have to be shook of me\nWashing my boxers, shirts folded nice and creased\nPlus when we argue, she will never pull a beast\nClap for my baby, award winning, best nookie\nI been in the whole wide world, that's why I stay spending\n\n\nI want you in a scarf, boy shorts around the house\nWife beater, undercover, sitting on the couch\nIsley's is playing, lights dim, vanilla candles is melting\nIt's a long time, don't let no one else in\nFresh out the tub, sweetness and peaches\nBody work splash around your neck, the kid admire all your features\nNiggas be hollering; peace ma, what up boo?\nYou suck your teeth and keep it moving with the screw, yes\n\n\nHappy birthday, red roses, big cakes\nDonna Karen slippers, got your birthday gift by the lake\nBig boats, thick ropes, ostrich purses\nSnakeskin boots, Jared Jewelers, the mink cost mad loot\nSki trips, resorts, close your eyes, baby, make a wish\nBlow your cake out, earrings is snowflaked out\nWill you marry me?

Was the thing so bad?) It's like...\nYo, there ain't too many people I would die for\nThat I would lay down for, you heard...\nIt's like my family, my closest friends that's here in my circle\nYouknowImean? My moms and 'em, my babies, man\nThat's word to mother, son, that's what it is...\n(I'll die for you, I'll die for you) Uh-huh...\nThat's right, man (I'll die for you) Just some real shit...\n\nAiyo, I'll die for the prophets and I'll die for the Lord\nOn the battlefield, wounded badly, holding a sword\nWith no questions asked, I already know, it's all for the cause\nJust laying me facing the East, when I'm under the floor\nI might've sinned in the process, from being, in the projects\nEyes swept from all the anger, that could've fucked with my conscience\nAnd more or less, I'm a man of my word\nMy body is holding a couple scars on it, though I was never a bird\n + (sample)\nFor Martin Luther and my brother Malcolm (I'll die for you)\nAnd my ancestors picking cotton (I'll die for you)\nMy close homies that get it popping (I'll die for you)\nYou what time it is, nigga what?\n\nAiyo, I'd die for my moms, and I'd die for my kids\nIf you, really my Queen, then I'd die for my wis\nEven my mans, if we that tight\nJump in front of a biscuit, snuff money with all of my mics\nOr we can brawl it out and take his life\nBy taking his gun, no problem\nJust make sure we eating when we on the run\nLike slaves that's chained together, who killed master?\nThe dogs is coming, the pigs is gon' blast ya\nI'd die for you, I'd die for my brother\nDie for the babies who can't eat with bare feet who need they mother\nI put niggas lights out like Con Ed, my verbal is bond\nMy bread'll blow you, show you who's real with the arms\n + (sample)\nDog, you want revenge on that devil Satan? (I'll die for you)\nWe could do it now instead of waiting (I'll die for you)\nWe don't have to wait for revelations (I'll die for you)\nWe'll sort this out in other conversations\n\nYo, I'd never jump out the window, lose my life for a lame ass nigga\nThat scene is bogus, it's not in the picture\nYou just can't feed me anything like \"Yo, Tone it's beef\"\nExpect me to go all out, jump in and bust my heat\nFirst off, bruh, you not my peeps\nYeah, I know we from the same town and shit, but we ain't that deep\nWe never stuck nothing, oxed something, ran together, popped something\nI thought ya team was wolves, cocksucker, stop fronting\nYou barking like you got the town in a smash\nI'd never lay down for you, faggot nigga, you ass\n + (sample)\nWop them niggas that be yelling that (I'll die for you)\nWhen they broke you be heating that (I'll die for you)\nJust stick 'em for they packs, they be crying (I'll die for you)\nAnd just bitch mothafuckas burn..."}}, {"title": "I Love You For All

light poles\nShout out to the Bronx, nigga!\n\nAye, yo, this shit go way back like a Uni marker, kid\nBombing the D train and hit the Bronx up\nKrylon bandits attack, Planet Rock, Bambaataa\nPeace to

voice sweet and low says\n(Who is it) She opens up the door and lets me in (let me in)\nNever once did she say where have you been?\nShe said, (are you hungry), are you hungry honey, (did you eat)\nYeahhh, let me hang up your coat\nThe woman says, pass me your hat\nAnd all the while she's smiling\nNever raises her voice\nIt's five o'clock in the morning and I don't give it a second thought\nIt\u2019s a Thin Line Between Love and Hate\nDon't think you can keep breaking your woman's heart\nIt\u2019s a Thin Line Between Love and Hate\nAnd you should sit back and enjoy it\n(It\u2019s a Thin Line), Yes it is, yes it is, (Between Love and Hate)\nShe gonna fool you one day\nThe sweetest woman in the world, can be the meanest woman in the world\n(If you like her that way)\nYou keep hurting her, she keep being quiet\nShe might be holding something inside, she gonna hurt you one day\nNow I'm laying in the hospital, bandaged from feet to head\nIn a state of shock, just that much from being dead\nI didn't think my woman can do something like this to me\nI didn't think the girl had the nerve\nHere I am, I guess actions speak louder than words\nIt\u2019s a Thin Line Between Love and Hate\nDon't keep thinking you can keep treating your woman bad\nIt\u2019s a Thin Line Between Love and Hate\nShe won't ever get mad\n(It\u2019s a Thin Line), Yes it is, yes it is, (Between Love and Hate)\nShe's gonna fool you one day\n(It\u2019s a Thin), It's a line thin, (Line Between Love and Hate), between love and hate\nIt\u2019s a Thin Line Between Love and Hate\nShe's gonna fool you one day\n(It\u2019s a Thin Line), Yes it is, (Between Love and Hate)\n\n*Sounds of loading bullets into a gun\nHey Tone!\nWhats the deal?\nThey wanna play?\nLet's get these motherfuckers!", "image": "https://images.genius.com/d574d4ae0fd1bf98f6ac441244ddbf96.1000x1000x1.jpg", "artist": "Ghostface Killah", "raw": {"annotation_count": 3, "api_path": "/songs/607681",

low says\n(Who is it) She opens up the door and lets me in (let me in)\nNever once did she say where have you been?\nShe said, (are you hungry), are you hungry honey, (did you eat)\nYeahhh, let me hang up your coat\nThe woman says, pass me your hat\nAnd all the while she's smiling\nNever raises her voice\nIt's five o'clock in the morning and I don't give it a second thought\nIt\u2019s a Thin Line Between Love and Hate\nDon't think you can keep breaking your woman's heart\nIt\u2019s a Thin Line Between Love and Hate\nAnd you should sit back and enjoy it\n(It\u2019s a Thin Line), Yes it is, yes it is, (Between Love and Hate)\nShe gonna fool you one day\nThe sweetest woman in the world, can be the meanest woman in the world\n(If you like her that way)\nYou keep hurting her, she keep being quiet\nShe might be holding something inside, she gonna hurt you one day\nNow I'm laying in the hospital, bandaged from feet to head\nIn a state of shock, just that much from being dead\nI didn't think my woman can do something like this to me\nI didn't think the girl had the nerve\nHere I am, I guess actions speak louder than words\nIt\u2019s a Thin Line Between Love and Hate\nDon't keep thinking you can keep treating your woman bad\nIt\u2019s a Thin Line Between Love and Hate\nShe won't ever get mad\n(It\u2019s a Thin Line), Yes it is, yes it is, (Between Love and Hate)\nShe's gonna fool you one day\n(It\u2019s a Thin), It's a line thin, (Line Between Love and Hate), between love and hate\nIt\u2019s a Thin Line Between Love and Hate\nShe's gonna fool you one day\n(It\u2019s a Thin Line), Yes it is, (Between Love and Hate)\n\n*Sounds of loading bullets into a gun\nHey Tone!\nWhats the deal?\nThey wanna play?\nLet's get these motherfuckers!"}}, {"title": "It's Over",

straight out the hood\n\nYo\nAiyyo, I woke up early took a stretch and a yawn\nHad a 2 o'clock appointment with this girl name Dawn\nShe ain't the Avon lady but her beauty was strong\nRight before she went to rest she had me singin this song\nShe must be a special lady\nAnd a very exciting girl\nI don't know\nShe had the high-glow's switchin\nSee her in the club you hear others chicks bitchin\nBut Dawn quit to bust a bitch ass and shit\nSee she did 12 months over a ratchet\nNot no crab shit\nGot bagged with the MAC\nTaxi cab shit\nClip was hangin out her panties with no where to stash it\nIt was classic\nNowadays shes laid back\nHelpin me perfect my rap\nOnly pink and smoked salmon where she feed her cat\nWhite, furry thing\nDiamond cut like johnny lex collar attached\nLickin glass bowls in her cat clothes\nCause crazy stacks\nFinicky thing\nHer kittin drink Polar Spring\nTake naps\nNear her jewerly box\nShe play with all the rings\nAnd when she step out the tub its like an ill flick\nCarmel skin, bath and body works leave the whole room lit\nCinnamon candles, sweet side, they on relax mode\nPaint her toes on the bed slow, watchin me\nVersace robe on her body, peak, sippin asti (piemonte)\nShe a perfect 10 in my wildest dreams DAWN\n\nAiyyo, she gotta be gone\nWaitin on my sweet strawberry pecan rican LaShawn\nHoldin my taffy down when I'm gone\nThree fourths of her body always covered with clothes\nThats why I'm eatin her candy\nAnd suckin her toes\nSweet sexy LaShawn\nShe got body like whats goin on\nOn some marvin gaye shit like lets get it onnnnn\nSuuuugarrrr\nLetssss getttt it onnnnn\nAyo she a diamond in the rough\nBlack rose in the hood\nI love my queen and she treat me good\nFuck cookin for me\nShe stash me out when the feds come lookin for me\nI'm not cheatin on her or beatin on her\nI spend the weekend on her\nWe on the block when the bills start creepin on her\nShe right there when it gets sticky\nShe strict politic to the vicky's\nAnd a fly aviator the color of sky\nGod on her side\nIndian chick with cat eyes\nMad respect with the fat thighs\nShe busts guns for the revolution\nWould straight leave her if she prostituting\nYo my girls the bomb\nIntelligent mind\nSky blue louis vetton\nLeg muscles, deep dimples\nBody is soft she smell fresh like a new born\nPretty feet peitete ass nice shoes on\nThe sunshine for my quiet storm\nKeepin the food warm when I'm gone\nIt won't be long 'til I'm back to my sweet butter pecan rican LaShawn\nHit me up baby girl, P.S. Cappadon'\n\nAiyyo, aiyyo I woke up in the morning still drunk off the Henn\nHad a 3'oclock appointment with this girl name Jen\nYou know Jen from a hundred and ten, she push the Lex Coupe\nPart time fashion designer she work for Jet Blue\nPretty young thing, with a body like vida\nAss off the meter, Eva Mendes look, strut like a diva\nLeave her shine fine, blow minds like dimes of a cheeba\nShe like it from behind, slow grind, sometimes with her feet up\nMs. Bonita Applebum Bottom, thick as a Roman column\nRaw dick it down, love me, even if I'm holdin condoms!\nCause she my bitch, the only cat that I lick\nThrowin that ass like Ciara on the top of that whip\nLatin decent, velour suit with the cameltoe print\nPeppermint flared panties with the garder-belt clips\nTattoo of a small butterfly on her inner thigh\nEven at my loneliest times you that Jen will ride...\n\nWhether Jen, Dawn, or Shawn its the same situation\n'Bout a girl I met who had many temptations\nShe was so fly, get high, well understood\nBig-ass big brains and straight out the hood"}}, {"title": "Josephine", "album": "More Fish", "year": "2006-12-12", "lyrics": "God's woman... what's going on?\nI know things seem messed up sometime\nYou stressed out and you can't handle the situation\nSometime it feels like you lacking the guidance\nAnd you don't know what to do... but stay strong\nAnd keep in mind that he always loves you...\nIt's what it is... that's right sugar love\nCome on...\n\nJosephine, the times are getting tough\nSeems to me... you just won't get enough\nThe rain, won't wash away, your sins...\nYou'll be here, to do them all over again...\n\nYo, I know this chick from the hood named Courtney Cox\nAnd her brain is easy to pick like faulty locks\nShe's awfully hot, asshole burning like tobasco\nShe used to be thick, it's like where the hell her ass go\nStarted smoking weed and graduated to the pipe\nThought that she could quit but her calculations wasn't right\nInfactuated with the life of dope fiends and crack pushers\nProstituting for old pimps who mack hookers\nPutting dope in the cook, searching for her vein\nTracks all over her arms, she never felt the pain\nThe monkey on her back is now a gorilla\nFiending for a hit knowing one day it's gon' kill her\nThe clinic didn't help (nope) she just another young black woman\nDestroying her pretty image and her health\nGot me thinking to myself, damn, how could this happen?\nI seen her on the corner, nodding off, sniffin' and scratching\n\n\nShe wakes up, with an urge to get high\nEveryday, the same routine, needing a morning fix to get by\nSo she reaches for her purse, grab the bag and the needle\nTie a sock around her arm and start shooting up the diesel\nHaving flashbacks, screwing some dude up in his hatchback\nThe night before, body still sore, holding her ass crack\nA regular John, she met him through Tom\nShe passed out with the syringe still stuck in her arm\nDying a slow death, oh, she losing her damn mind\nFrom the troubles of the world, feeling cursed by mankind\nUh, caught up in a desperate rage, was blessed with AIDS\nLost her appetite, hardly slept in days\nNow it's too late, praying to Jesus, she fucked around\nWith the wrong penis, contaminated with diseases\nTwo months pregnant, carrying around her fetus\nBut they found her on Broad, in the dumpster, behind the cleaners\n\n\nJosephine, what's wrong, baby?\nCome on...\n\nYo, what your momma gonna think of you girl?\nHer little baby's all doped up, strung out on the world\nTry'nna make some quick cash for a hit of that stash\nListen, baby, you growing up much too fast\nUh, this goes out to every project and every ghetto\nFor those getting high, using drugs on every level\nLiving your life, day and night, getting stoned\nYou better leave those drugs alone, feel me?\n\nUp all night, under the party lights\nSame old popping and party hopping\nAll of your so called friends, are leading you down the wrong road\nLeading you back to crack, it's a known fact\nIt is time, that you need me, I'll be there, to help ya\nI'll be your leaning pole when you're falling down\nI'll be there, when you falling down

sometime\nYou stressed out and you can't handle the situation\nSometime it feels like you lacking the guidance\nAnd you don't know what to do... but stay strong\nAnd keep in mind that he always loves you...\nIt's what it is... that's right sugar love\nCome on...\n\nJosephine, the times are getting tough\nSeems to me... you just won't get enough\nThe rain, won't wash away, your sins...\nYou'll be here, to do them all over again...\n\nYo, I know this chick from the hood named Courtney Cox\nAnd her brain is easy to pick like faulty locks\nShe's awfully hot, asshole burning like tobasco\nShe used to be thick, it's like where the hell her ass go\nStarted smoking weed and graduated to the pipe\nThought that she could quit but her calculations wasn't right\nInfactuated with the life of dope fiends and crack pushers\nProstituting for old pimps who mack hookers\nPutting dope in the cook, searching for her vein\nTracks all over her arms, she never felt the pain\nThe monkey on her back is now a gorilla\nFiending for a hit knowing one day it's gon' kill her\nThe clinic didn't help (nope) she just another young black woman\nDestroying her pretty image and her health\nGot me thinking to myself, damn, how could this happen?\nI seen her on the corner, nodding off, sniffin' and scratching\n\n\nShe wakes up, with an urge to get high\nEveryday, the same routine, needing a morning fix to get by\nSo she reaches for her purse, grab the bag and the needle\nTie a sock around her arm and start shooting up the diesel\nHaving flashbacks, screwing some dude up in his hatchback\nThe night before, body still sore, holding her ass crack\nA regular John, she met him through Tom\nShe passed out with the syringe still stuck in her arm\nDying a slow death, oh, she losing her damn mind\nFrom the troubles of the world, feeling cursed by mankind\nUh, caught up in a desperate rage, was blessed with AIDS\nLost her appetite, hardly slept in days\nNow it's too late, praying to Jesus, she fucked around\nWith the wrong penis, contaminated with diseases\nTwo months pregnant, carrying around her fetus\nBut they found her on Broad, in the dumpster, behind the cleaners\n\n\nJosephine, what's wrong, baby?\nCome on...\n\nYo, what your momma gonna think of you girl?\nHer little baby's all doped up, strung out on the world\nTry'nna make some quick cash for a hit of that stash\nListen, baby, you growing up much too fast\nUh, this goes out to every project and every ghetto\nFor those getting high, using drugs on every level\nLiving your life, day and night, getting stoned\nYou better leave those drugs alone, feel me?\n\nUp all night, under the party lights\nSame old popping and party hopping\nAll of your so called friends, are leading you down the wrong road\nLeading you back to crack, it's a known fact\nIt is time, that you need me, I'll be there, to help ya\nI'll be your leaning pole when you're falling down\nI'll be there, when you falling down (sooner or later)"}}, {"title":

I can't feel my face\nMy heart pounding and shit (audible heart)\nParanoid as a motherfucker right now, who the fuck?\nClose the blinds and shit! Who that? Captain Kirk?\nThe Stark...enterprise, enterprise I was on and some shit?\n..I need some pussy though I'm ready for a Catwoman or something\nF-fuck it, lets go!\nAiyyo Shareefa go to the store for me. I need some razors and a fresh box\nOf baggies, the ones with the tint in them!\nAiyyo son turn that water down a little bit, just a little bit..Thank You\nI need two waters, a dutch, and a cranberry Snapple)\n\nAll around the world today, the Kilo is the measure\n(Whoever got the kilos got the candy, man)\nA kilo is a thousand grams, its easy to remember\n(You never catch the kid going hand to hand)\nAll around the world today, the Kilo is the measure\n(Once you got the funds you got the panties, man)\nA Kilo is a thousand grams, its easy to remember\n(Throughout the I 9 to 5 I'm the Handyman)\n\nRacing through the hood, ski mask off\nCriminology hustle, when goons play the heat, blast off\nAnd every direction, protect ya babies, your moms\nLate night like Carson Daly, Theo Bailey, we stay armed\nGrits box, vacuum tight, concealing the powder\nFive fake cans of blow to throw them off wit the flower\nRed dots on me, big scopes, bullets the size of nickels\nGot Starkey coming out of his coat\nI gots to jet, don't look back, my cardio's killing me\nOld ladies is like 'Hold ya head, Tone, literally'\nAll this, for a thousand grams?\nI'd rather be a con artist scheaming with a thousand scams\n\n\nAiyyo peace to those cooking that raw, powder white\nGet your sniff on, scarface niggas, we getting right\nSome call it bricks, some call it birds\nHow many niggas get they lives tooken playing with shit, then catch a curb\nYou would go to jail\nGet caught with this, niggas'll grow to fail\nStop playing, pot slaying, baking soda and scales\nThey lived like brothers, word life, connects discovered\nMost niggas get hard, from fucking with them pipes and hustlers\nKilos is one thousand grams\nYou know your ammo better be heavy cause soon kids is coming in camo\nProtect your land daddy, I'm an announcer\nYou get caught with an ounce and its over\nMatter 'fact they takin you down, son\n\n\nBricks, Tar caps, powder, cooked up crack\nPhones is tapped over franklin's stacks\nKingpins put in bullpens, old connects get paro'\nBreak out of town when the Jakes take down the Pharaoh\nReason, He was moving that peruvian white\nBlowing coolies into hoopties , slamming cuties and ice\nBig heavy pots over hot stoves\nMayonnaise jars of water with rocks in them got my whole projects out of order\nA Kilo is a thousand grams\nBeige, gold, brown, dirty, fluffy, tan, extract oil cut from cuban plants\nThe chemist is brolic, pyrex scholars\nProfessors at war over raw, killing partners for a million dollars\n\n\nSome say a drug dealers destiny is reachin the ki'\nI'd rather be the man behind the door, supplying the streets\nA hundred birds go out, looking like textbooks\nWhen they wrapped and stuffed\nFour days later straight cash, two million bucks\nStrictly powder, no cut\nYour coke is vialed in, whats up?\nY'all beefin over little shit, we sniff, the balance split up\nIn a plane or a penthouse, office or a warehouse\nTony's got it nice, we never heard of any big droughts\nA Kilo is a thousand grams\nA pile of sand is equivilant, to the eye\nIt's nice to have a thousand fans\nCoke buyers, some be liars\nTherefore, you check for wires\nDedicated dealers, during holidays we give 'em lighters\n\nRed tops, blue tops, green tops, yellow tops\nPurple tops, beige tops, white tops, grey tops\nBlack tops, clear tops, gold tops, pink tops\nSilver tops, tan tops, aqua tops, orange tops\nSalt tops, long tops, short tops, 12 12's\n58 58's, weed bags, ziplocks\nBig rocks, coke spots, big Glocks, one OT's\nCrumbs chopped, hot pots, one plate, crack Spot\n\n\nThirteen getting it, pyrex whipping it\nLike UPS, pack it up, shipping it\nWhether base or sniffing it, I got your fix\nThe story's foretold like apocalypse\nIt was me Michael T.T., handing out freebies\nTaking over blocks, telling niggas to be fee\nWhere big brother 'Vine'll leave the body in the street\nSomething kinda like how I be bodying the beat\nWe was 300 deep like the Persian soldiers\nWord spread fast, we was serving boulders\nTen crack commandments, holy Moses\nIf you don't fit must equip icer toners\nNever grip they holders, fingers to the snitchers\nThe New York niggas be taking all our bitches\nBut we be God damned if taking all our business\nDuct tape, hard tops, C.S.I. forensics"}}, {"title": "King of New York", "album": "Twelve Reasons To Die II",

syndicate\nWalk with black pride\nHe a monsoon mastermind\nFlyer than the Isleys\nPut a pop in your pudding\nBut not the Cosby's type\nI'm talking big guns and Cadillac coupes\nThe New York monsignor's just scared of his suits\nAnd his troops is like loyal lions, ready to feast\nAt the first drop of blood that falls down from the beast\nRoam these streets with iced out case for the

and write \"Demon\" in blood\nOn her titties, no remorse for life\nHe wild for the night, son, gun and knife\nLiving trife reckless, hang a man by his necklace\nThen mail it to his family with blood still on it\nFew black roses, maybe a finger or two\nHe out to be the King of New York\nAnd he gon' do exactly what he put his mind to\nHe a crimeboy, he's diligent\nSilverback gorilla and he's

but can't be it\nOnly one could rise above all the rest\nAnd I got faith in my man, Lest\nTake down the King's throne\nConquer the warzone\n\nLester Kane, I call him LK for short\nSee LK pushing for that King of New York\nFew million dollar cribs\nLiberace jewel box, gold ox\nOstrich leather shoes, Egyptian socks\nTailor made shoes built like a brick house\nSix foot nine, son\nThe God had to duck in his house\nKeep a trail of bitches, I'm talking three on each side\nThe head of his syndicate\nWalk with black pride\nHe a monsoon mastermind\nFlyer than the Isleys\nPut a pop in your pudding\nBut not the Cosby's type\nI'm talking big guns and Cadillac coupes\nThe New York monsignor's just scared of his suits\nAnd his troops is like loyal lions, ready to feast\nAt the first drop of blood that falls down from the beast\nRoam these streets with iced out case for the syndicate\nFucking with Lester on these blocks, boy, you in for it\n\nPushing for the King of New York, I see it\nGangsters try so hard but can't be it\nOnly one could rise above all the rest\nAnd I got faith in my man, Lest\nTake down the King's throne\nConquer the warzone\n\nAll hail to the King Kane\nSling remarkable razor lines\nOrganized crime brung shotty's under the trenchcoat\nBlack Bugatti with gold spokes, folks get heart attacks\nSitting on the top of the glow, money in garbage bags\nWashing up the restaurants, nightclubs, etcetera\nPinky ring worth a small island, I raise the bezel up\nWomen on they're night strolls turning tricks and they trained to go\nNothin' stoppin' my function, got coppers on the payroll\nLawyers and judges quick to toss cases when I say so\nKing of New York with pesos\nLeaving 'em foaming, mouths stitched\nEyes wide shut but speaking on my firm\nWhen will they learn, loose lips will get your flesh burned\nPuffing on a Cohiba Cuban\nThem rubies got some bullets with they're name on it\nAnd I'm itching to send it through\nCity is mine with war on my mind\nAnd take the throne by design\nYes, it's mine, I claim the spot cause I'm\n\nPushing for the King of New York, I see it\nGangsters try so hard but can't be it\nOnly one could rise above all the rest\nAnd I got faith in my man, Lest\nTake down the King's throne\nConquer the warzone\n\nTemper like a old dad who lost his kids\nLester'd be the first to spaz out and slap you with\nHeadlocked the bitch, spit in the mouth while she screaming\nTie her to the cross in the church and write \"Demon\" in blood\nOn her titties, no remorse for life\nHe wild for the night, son, gun and knife\nLiving trife reckless, hang a man by his necklace\nThen mail it to his family with blood still on it\nFew black roses, maybe a finger or two\nHe out to be the King of New York\nAnd he gon' do exactly what he put his mind to\nHe a crimeboy, he's diligent\nSilverback gorilla and he's killing it\nRuthless, this man reminds me of myself\nTony Starks, the King obsessed with wealth... and power\nBuilt for the takeover\nRearrange your whole damn face\nYou need a makeover\n\nPushing for the King of New York, I see it\nGangsters try so hard but can't be it\nOnly one could rise above all the rust\nAnd I got faith in my man, Lest\nTake down the King's throne\nConquer the warzone"}}, {"title": "Kunta Fly Shit", "album": "The Pretty Toney Album", "year": "2004-04-20", "lyrics": "Yo Lord did you peep

we shuffle the cards\nI've been wanting you for mad years, when the elevators broke\nI run and help you with your bags upstairs\nI was scoping you out, today you was late, to leave by 8\nWith no time to be at work at 9\nShe'll be back by 6, son pissed you off, I know\nWhen I spoke, yo, you didn't say shit\nBut still, you was looking mad cute to me\nWith your lips poked out, being rude to me\nYou're still sexy, luscious, and all them words\nOnly girl in the building with a full length fur\nHad no choice to raise and press up, explain how I feel\nIt's only your love I want the best of\n\n\nI had a dream, yo, I seen you on the laundry mat\nFolding your clothes by the dryer, my drawers is wet\nSo you passed me a Bounce, one fell when I bend down\nAnd got up, you start tonguing me down\nButterflies ran across my stomach\nDidn't wanna put the fire out, cuz God damn, I love it\nMoved the basket out the way, cleared the table\nLaid you down, my mouth slid past your navel\nYour feet, had knocked over the Clorox bleach\nHeld my head closer to you when my tongue got deep\nI'm saying we both of those, this how I feel\nIf you don't want a part of me, it's no big deal\nBut ma, I'm not here to game you, babe, I'm going on vibes\nSomewhere inside, I know you feel the same\nIt's alright tho, you look like, you know how to get it\nHere take my keys, come upstairs in a minute\n\n\nLet's stop faking, let's just go get naked\nNo more discussion, we can get to kiss and hugging\nMy premonition, told me I got what you're missing\nSo let's stop playing, baby girl, that's

can't take it, let's stop playing\nOh, you know, you know\n\nYo, boo, let's cut the crap, you know we like each other\nI been wanting you bad, yo, that's word to my mother\nI know you got a man, and I'm involved\nBut we can play this right, if we shuffle the cards\nI've been wanting you for mad years, when the elevators broke\nI run and help you with your bags upstairs\nI was scoping you out, today you was late, to leave by 8\nWith no time to be at work at 9\nShe'll be back by 6, son pissed you off, I know\nWhen I spoke, yo, you didn't say shit\nBut still, you was looking mad cute to me\nWith your lips poked out, being rude to me\nYou're still sexy, luscious, and all them words\nOnly girl in the building with a full length fur\nHad no choice to raise and press up, explain how I feel\nIt's only your love I want the best of\n\n\nI had a dream, yo, I seen you on the laundry mat\nFolding your clothes by the dryer, my drawers is wet\nSo you passed me a Bounce, one fell when I bend down\nAnd got up, you start tonguing me down\nButterflies ran across my stomach\nDidn't wanna put the fire out, cuz God damn, I love it\nMoved the basket out the way, cleared the table\nLaid you down, my mouth slid past your navel\nYour feet, had knocked over the Clorox bleach\nHeld my head closer to you when my tongue got deep\nI'm saying we both of those, this how I feel\nIf you don't want a part of me, it's no big deal\nBut ma, I'm not here to game you, babe, I'm going on vibes\nSomewhere inside, I know you feel the same\nIt's alright tho, you look like, you know how to get it\nHere take my keys, come upstairs in a minute\n\n\nLet's stop faking, let's just go get naked\nNo more discussion, we can get to kiss and hugging\nMy premonition, told me I got what you're missing\nSo let's stop playing, baby girl, that's all I'm saying"}}, {"title": "Let The Record Spin", "album": "Twelve Reasons To Die II", "year": "2015-07-10", "lyrics": "I resurrect him, summon the killah\nThe

complete\nThere's only one thing left to do\nLogan begs him to stop, but Lester does not listen\nHe puts the gun to his head, and pulls the trigger\nKilling himself with honor\nSeconds before Lester's final breath escapes his body\nGhostface becomes consumed by a diabolical revelation\nInhabit the flesh of his young son, and he could live as a reincarnated Tony Starks\n\nAyo fuck it, I'm taking the soul of my son\nLive through the eyes of my young\nWe gon' rule, conquer, pillage and destroy\nBulletproof shit, blast through alloys\nBut first things first bitch you fuck with the worst\nLogan, I'm about to quench ya thirst\nPut two to your head, leak brainial fluid\n(No please! Starks, don't do it!)\nBang bang, no more time for compassion\nMy reactions to your action: Satisfaction\nNo more DeLucas, the rise of a new day\nHey, hey, Mr. GFK\nThe rhymes of the black suits no longer play\nI'm avenged, a proud man walking the Earth\nSatisfied with my kills and my life's a rebirth\nSo live long, and long live the illest\nTwelve Reasons to Die, Ghostface Killah\n\nAs thunder strikes, and the clouds smother the full moon\nThe soul of Tony Starks' son is cast into an abyss of fog\nAnd the spirit of Ghostface Killah reascends into his body\nBecoming a human inferno of vengeful rage\nLogan screams in terror, as she realizes her fate\nThe possessed boy begins stabbing her, again, again, and again\nNow standing alone, blade in his hand, he grins at triumph\n*sighs* the sweet taste of revenge\nLester Kane and Tony Starks were nothing more than kindred spirits\nSeparated by time and space, but bonded together by violence and death\nA touch of fate brought these two souls together\nBut for one of them, the ultimate price was paid\nThis is not the last we'll ever hear of Tony Starks\nActuality, this is a new beginning\nTony Starks was once a man, and became a demon\nBut now lives again, in the flesh and blood\nOf the Ghostface Killah", "image": "https://images.genius.com/acf47354b3403ad918031650402ae958.1000x1000x1.jpg", "artist": "Ghostface Killah",

as a reincarnated Tony Starks\n\nAyo fuck it, I'm taking the soul of my son\nLive through the eyes of my young\nWe gon' rule, conquer, pillage and destroy\nBulletproof shit, blast through alloys\nBut first things first bitch you fuck with the worst\nLogan, I'm about to quench ya thirst\nPut two to your head, leak brainial fluid\n(No please! Starks, don't do it!)\nBang bang, no more time for compassion\nMy reactions to your action: Satisfaction\nNo more DeLucas, the rise of a new day\nHey, hey, Mr. GFK\nThe rhymes of the black suits no longer play\nI'm avenged, a proud man walking the Earth\nSatisfied with my kills and my life's a rebirth\nSo live long, and long live the illest\nTwelve Reasons to Die, Ghostface Killah\n\nAs thunder strikes, and the clouds smother the full moon\nThe soul of Tony Starks' son is cast into an abyss of fog\nAnd the spirit of Ghostface Killah reascends into his body\nBecoming a human inferno of vengeful rage\nLogan screams in terror, as she realizes her fate\nThe possessed boy begins stabbing her, again, again, and again\nNow standing alone, blade in his hand, he grins at triumph\n*sighs* the sweet taste of revenge\nLester Kane and Tony Starks were nothing more than kindred spirits\nSeparated by time and space, but bonded together by violence and death\nA touch of fate brought these two souls together\nBut for one of them, the ultimate price was paid\nThis is not the last we'll ever hear of Tony Starks\nActuality, this is a new beginning\nTony Starks was once a man, and became a demon\nBut now lives again, in the flesh and blood\nOf the Ghostface Killah"}}, {"title": "Lonely", "album": "Ghostdini: Wizard of Poetry in Emerald City", "year": "2009-09-29", "lyrics": "Don't be surprised, when you see me 'round town\nWalking around, with my head hung down\nI'm so lonely, I'm so lonely\nAnd don't be surprised, if you see me on the train\nLike a homeless man, who's lost his way\nI'm so lonely, I'm so lonely\n\nOn this cold pavement, I feel like laying\nIn the middle of the street, and just saying\nI can't take it, I won't make it\nToo much weight on my shoulders, and my kids are getting older\nFor so long, I've been so strong\nI've been crying all week since you've been gone\nAnd as the tears roll out my eyes\nAnother happy young couples walks by\n\n\nSomeone been sleeping in my bed, eating my food\nUsing my soap, laying up in my pool\nWalking around in his boxers, like every thing's cool\nGassing my chick for the whip, dropping her off at school\nUnder my covers and changing my channels\nPlaying my CD's in my robes, another man's burning my candles\nMy cologne's half way gone, a fake don, my wiz fell for\nNow she strolls the park under his arm\nThis is my fault, I've never thought I'd see this coming\nFrom the outside bugging, with crazy knots in my stomach\nSay what goes around, comes around, now I know it now\nNow I'm the fool looking in while it's going down\nIf somebody would of told me, I might be lonely\nNow it's on me, baby call me please\n\n\nNow he's getting all my kisses, stroking my loving\nThat 'posed to be me, but I was too stupid and stubborn\nLike a piece of rope, I let it go, my mother said it so\nYou better straighten up, don't act like you didn't know\nHer birthday came, heard she was hugged up, wearing his chain\nPlay in the sky box, at some bullshit Knick game\nMy son said, daddy, he like his eggs well done\nAnd he kinda cool, mommy happy, I can't front\nHe take us on trips and clothes shopping, most of the time\nWe watch flicks on your surround sound, he watch boxing\nYou better go beg or something, before she go love him\nHe's taking your spot, cuz you was dissing mommy, you bugging\nThey don't argue, he sent her flowers for no reason\nShe's cheesing, I'm wishing you could come back and see this", "image": "https://images.genius.com/ea54fa933d61e534fbf14d9509cc7146.1000x1000x1.jpg", "artist": "Ghostface Killah", "raw": {"annotation_count": 3, "api_path": "/songs/21179", "description": {"dom": {"tag": "root", "children": [{"tag": "p", "children": ["A classic baring of emotions from Ghostface as he watches, or imagines watching, his ex (and their children) going on with their life without him.

be surprised, if you see me on the train\nLike a homeless man, who's lost his way\nI'm so lonely, I'm so lonely\n\nOn this cold pavement, I feel like laying\nIn the middle of the street, and just saying\nI can't take it, I won't make it\nToo much weight on my shoulders, and my kids are getting older\nFor so long, I've been so strong\nI've been crying all week since you've been gone\nAnd as the tears roll out my eyes\nAnother happy young couples walks by\n\n\nSomeone been sleeping in my bed, eating my food\nUsing my soap, laying up in my pool\nWalking around in his boxers, like every thing's cool\nGassing my chick for the whip, dropping her off at school\nUnder my covers and changing my channels\nPlaying my CD's in my robes, another man's burning my candles\nMy cologne's half way gone, a fake don, my wiz fell for\nNow she strolls the park under his arm\nThis is my fault, I've never thought I'd see this coming\nFrom the outside bugging, with crazy knots in my stomach\nSay what goes around, comes around, now I know it now\nNow I'm the fool looking in while it's going down\nIf somebody would of told me, I might be lonely\nNow it's on me, baby call me please\n\n\nNow he's getting all my kisses, stroking my loving\nThat 'posed to be me, but I was too stupid and stubborn\nLike a piece of rope, I let it go, my mother said it so\nYou better straighten up, don't act like you didn't know\nHer birthday came, heard she was hugged up, wearing his chain\nPlay in the sky box, at some bullshit Knick game\nMy son said, daddy, he like his eggs well done\nAnd he kinda cool, mommy happy, I can't front\nHe take us on trips and clothes shopping, most of the time\nWe watch flicks on your surround sound, he watch boxing\nYou better go beg or something, before she go love him\nHe's taking your spot, cuz you was dissing mommy, you bugging\nThey don't argue, he sent her flowers for no reason\nShe's cheesing, I'm wishing you could come back and see this"}}, {"title": "Love", "album": "The

about 6 o'clock\nLove is love, it'd been a long time comin'\n9 long years, I know she missed my lovin'\nHuggin', kissin' in the scent of the kid\nShe gonna fall out when she see me at the crib\nDing dong, can I speak to Bamboo?\nIt's me Penelope, stop actin' a fool\nShe said, \"damn, I thought you was dead\nNot a phone call? Not a card in the mail?\"\nFor real a phone call? Stop\nYou know I had to up and leave\nI told you I'll be back, girl, but you ain't believe\nShe told me 9 was too long, and she got a new man\nOne who gon' stay and hold it down for the fam\nSo scram, there's no more love for the kid\nSo I turned my head down and walked away from the crib\n\nLoved so many times\nI've been alone so long\nHad to pull myself together\nFind my heart a brand new home\nGot a good thing goin' on\nCan't let you mess with my flow\nToo little, too late\nLove don't live here no more\n(Love is love, Tony's back up on the aisle)\n(Gone for 9 years like 9 months to a child)\nCried so many times\n(Where's my boo at? I need to see Bamboo)\n(I got a lot of things on my mind, to explain to you)\nLove don't live here no more\nLove don't live here no more\n\nIt's like that?\nOkay then where you put all my stuff at then?\nYou know, I thought, you know I swear he's, he been doin' this for too long\nI done came home, you got another man, you know what\n\nOh word, so you over it? That's absurd\nI never did a damn thing to deserved it\nThis is a man's world, I go away come home lookin' for you\nNow you fuckin' up the plans, girl\nYou another man's girl, that ain't kosher\nOnce you see the kid's face you're supposed to\nDrop what you're doin', show your loyalty and love\nStep out on the porch with a kiss and a hug\nYo you buggin'\n\n\nJust can't understand, you know. I treated you, I gave you everything you wanted. You know what I'm sayin'? And it's like you got another dude laying in the bed?\nWearin' my robes, wearin' you out\nI know I was gone but damn, I just can't get it, baby\nBut I loved you though man, and I still do though"}}, {"title": "Love Session", "album": "Bulletproof Wallets", "year": "2001-11-13", "lyrics": "Just like a fresh pair of Royals on the first day of school\nIt was love, even from the jump I spoiled you\nBefore the fame camera cars and the glitter\nThough my occupation is tasty for God's sake it came with the bitches\nBut that's on another note (uh-huh) let me explain here\nRight now sugar on how I feel for you\nLike when we UHH yo I get these crazy chills from you\nAnd when we done, yo I know the perfect meal for you\nThe mashed joints, big onions on sauteed fish\nLittle Royal, candle and one big kiss\nYou my pumpkin and my 'nilla custard; you cussed me out\nWhen you found condoms layin in my pocket I was busted\nI gets right witchu (uh) form a life with you (yeah)\nThe type after sex get a warm rag and then wipe you\nHyped up love light it up, might bite you at the altar\nI'm bitin off you, I'm wearin white too\n\nAin't it funny how tables turn, chase you all around\nChange your life baby, cause I love you baby\n (+ ad libs)\nStuck with me through the thick and thin\nThrough the pain and strife.. the love of my life\nSaid that it will ne-ver last\nBut I'm here by your side.. the love of my life\n\nAnd I'm here.. that's my word\nOnly fight you when we makin love, that's what I call it\nBurnin the chronic we laughin while I'm shittin on the toilet\nCamcord it, happy times record it; the time you asked me\nFor them blue Nike's - I was like, \"Boo I can't afford it\"\nI was fucked up, plus I was stuck, Starks the King\nHit the block and still scraped up, eighty beans\nHow you like them apples?

when we UHH yo I get these crazy chills from you\nAnd when we done, yo I know the perfect meal for you\nThe mashed joints, big onions on sauteed fish\nLittle Royal, candle and one big kiss\nYou my pumpkin and my 'nilla custard; you cussed me out\nWhen you found condoms layin in my pocket I was busted\nI gets right witchu (uh) form a life with you (yeah)\nThe type after sex get a warm rag and then wipe you\nHyped up love light it up, might bite you at the altar\nI'm bitin off you, I'm wearin white too\n\nAin't it funny how tables turn, chase you all around\nChange your life baby, cause I love you baby\n (+ ad libs)\nStuck with me through the thick and thin\nThrough the pain and strife.. the love of my life\nSaid that it will ne-ver last\nBut I'm here by your side.. the love of my life\n\nAnd I'm here.. that's my word\nOnly fight you when we makin love, that's what I call it\nBurnin the chronic we laughin while I'm shittin on the toilet\nCamcord it, happy times record it; the time you asked me\nFor them blue Nike's - I was like, \"Boo I can't afford it\"\nI was fucked up, plus I was stuck, Starks the King\nHit the block and still scraped up, eighty beans\nHow you like them apples? My technique is Taye Diggs\nYour attitude is right that's why I made you my Wiz\nThe only girl that can make my shit jump, with the slightest touch\nYou at the stove while I'm grabbin my stuff\nGod forbid somethin happen to us\nLet's remain and friends and discuss our troubles and might try again\nWord to my Iron pen, it's not good to hold the cryin in\nI feel the same way your heart's trapped in the lion's den\nIron Man, I am him\nIt's the beauty in our souls through Allah where the love lies within\n\nCan't believe you found love in me, through everything\nHeld me down like my boys in the streets, here's the ring\nWhatchu wanna do? Whatchu wanna do?\n\n\nEvery part of me, every thing I've done\nIs still there, still there, still care, ohhh\nAlways been there baby\nI don't wanna, and I don't wanna cry no more baby\nAnd I love,

worse\n\nYeah fam listen, I'm ambitious\nI'll leave a man missing\nPlain and simple, tickin' under his transmission\nDid my first hit 12 years old, pants sliddin'\nA little place in Coney Island called the clam kitchen\nI walk right up on the table where I can't miss em\nAnd his bodyguard coming out of the can pissin'\nThe two waiters serving plates stood in a trance, shivering\nI carried out the damn mission, that's loyalty\nNo regrets anything less will destroy the peace\nA boss is a boss learn to respect royalty\nRun off with money get put down in the soil free\nNow sit down and enjoy the feast, boys kapeesh\nBeen running here for 9 years\nAnd believe me none of them kind years\nI done lost about 9 peers\nCrime career never find fear\nSoulless eyes my guys got a blind stare\n\nMy intuition told me play my position and stay loyal\nYou ain't got to get your hands dirty, I'll do it for you\nI grew up on the crime side, the New York time side\nAnd gave up on everything when my moms died\nPerfected my craft on rooftops and staircases\nPulled robberies with no mask showing my bare face\nKeep it G, low key, and never ball out\nGot with a sick ass clique and went all out\nGat for gat back to back we can brawl out\nHundred deep run up in Macy's and aired em all out\nJust give the ordering my niggas will come\nGive me your gun, point em out and consider it done\nThe streets fathered me, so I'm considered its son\nKeep it real stay sucker free and the figures will come\nLive by the gun and put my life on the line\nAnybody can get left bullets right through your mind",

a plague, dope and them pushers, they'll destroy us, it's gunna get worse\n\nYeah fam listen, I'm ambitious\nI'll leave a man missing\nPlain and simple, tickin' under his transmission\nDid my first hit 12 years old, pants sliddin'\nA little place in Coney Island called the clam kitchen\nI walk right up on the table where I can't miss em\nAnd his bodyguard coming out of the can pissin'\nThe two waiters serving plates stood in a trance, shivering\nI carried out the damn mission, that's loyalty\nNo regrets anything less will destroy the peace\nA boss is a boss learn to respect royalty\nRun off with money get put down in the soil free\nNow sit down and enjoy the feast, boys kapeesh\nBeen running here for 9 years\nAnd believe me none of them kind years\nI done lost about 9 peers\nCrime career never find fear\nSoulless eyes my guys got a blind stare\n\nMy intuition told me play my position and stay loyal\nYou ain't got to get your hands dirty, I'll do it for you\nI grew up on the crime side, the New York time side\nAnd gave up on everything when my moms died\nPerfected my craft on rooftops and staircases\nPulled robberies with no mask showing my bare face\nKeep it G, low key, and never ball out\nGot with a sick ass clique and went all out\nGat for gat back to back we can brawl out\nHundred deep run up in Macy's and aired em all out\nJust give the ordering my niggas will come\nGive me your gun, point em out and consider it done\nThe streets fathered me, so I'm considered its son\nKeep it real stay sucker free and the figures will come\nLive by the gun and put my life on the line\nAnybody can get left bullets right through your mind"}}, {"title": "Major Operation (Skit)", "album": "Fishscale", "year": "2006-03-28", "lyrics": "Late night, at Tony Stark's

duck shit\nOne kid hollerin' what lookin' up, he the big wig\nFake ass cat, low life, sodomize mind\nBeatin niggas, big bricks of bread sellin' mad dimes\nHis feet hurt, networkin' he get no work\nYo, smack him where his hand hurt, fuck what he worth\nYo he sucked his thumb Slew footed kid laced with the pink gums\nStuntin to my Baltimore niggas that he on the run\nPlus he ill on the drums, heartburn for life, calcium man\nWatch him grab the Tums, he's a front\nPigeon toed Tyler's sister with the fat ass\nShow hash for Hines up the block plus he smashed her\nBig Buck did him something deadly, act premeditated\nBuck 60 strike was the medley\nNice like Van Halen, seen him at the tunnel with his skin peelin\nDid two days thought he was jailin\nYou get close, look at his hands\nThat's the same kid that cut his wrists, talkin' bout the cuffs did it\nHe bantam weight, frontin' majorly, eyes like Sammy Davis jr\nRounded off with a fade g, he sport the Bob Hope classics\nRan down Asics, Kmart, the short sleeve shit be the basics\nHe eat hams shitted on himself twice, big hatted Jews\nRushed the nigga out in Crown Heights\n\nYo let me tell you how the game go\nWe gettin rid of all the prostitutes\nTony wants the streets back fo sho\nToo many hustlers, too many thieves\nWe're fuckin up who's willin to fight and teach the seeds\nToo much TV, guns and robberies\nLust and greed and hate the 4 devils jealousy\n\nYo I-Cham punched Mase in his face over some bullshit\nThe other night they kidnapped his brother pokin it with knives\nIt's rainin', 85 degrees kinda muggy\nOne of the nights they thrown in his face it's real ugly\nYo we up in Jonesy's posin', all these niggas know me\nFrom fuckin' wit Un and these niggas, heavy parolees\nYo we played the speaker\nAnd from a distance we could see these chains\nThe P slayed, flat on his chest, was two plains\nAshy hands yo, no need for rings at all\nHe just cracked the V8 backed up, leaned against the wall\nLookin' flower, he just came home, he on like a fuck\nDid a dime for holdin' up the guards up in the armored truck\nTen years later son 280 on the weight tip\nHe throwin up six plates plus he studied Matrix\nHe's a wally horse shout it out sweatin through his valor\nCock-eyed nigga back up his neck he had shores\nSammy eagerly rode up on him, toxi off the turkey with the joint\nOn him\nFlower look his man stood up before him\nThe bitches hit the table, Jah king stripped off his cables\nShots went off, Sam'll get a chance to make his debut\nFlower grabbed Tiff his man with the sideburns, hat fell off\nWe noticed ring-worms, he hid behind Rich\nC-Allah hit the light switch, young girls were trampled\nIn the measured pool, pistol with Mase, and broke the handle\nDesperate crawlin to the door on all fours\nShim kicked the jukebox the theme song rode in was \"It's Yours\"\nOh my goodness, Ba grabbed the Mo bottle thrashin\nHe layin like a gay models shoutin out Sebastian\nHe smiled with his teeth missin begging for mercy\nNo more god, the 68 thousand down at pier 3\nOut came the cannon, whistled out zaggin\nCham snatched his flag four big rocks enter the dragon\nIt's over, another story told\nLyin' with the snakes, tongue kissin' cobras\n\nYo let me tell you how the game go\nWe gettin rid of all the prostitutes\nTony wants the streets back fo sho\nToo many hustlers, too many thieves\nWe're fuckin up who's willin to fight and teach the seeds\nToo much TV, guns and robberies\nLust and greed and hate the 4 devils jealousy", "image":

classics\nRan down Asics, Kmart, the short sleeve shit be the basics\nHe eat hams shitted on himself twice, big hatted Jews\nRushed the nigga out in Crown Heights\n\nYo let me tell you how the game go\nWe gettin rid of all the prostitutes\nTony wants the streets back fo sho\nToo many hustlers, too many thieves\nWe're fuckin up who's willin to fight and teach the seeds\nToo much TV, guns and robberies\nLust and greed and hate the 4 devils jealousy\n\nYo I-Cham punched Mase in his face over some bullshit\nThe other night they kidnapped his brother pokin it with knives\nIt's rainin', 85 degrees kinda muggy\nOne of the nights they thrown in his face it's real ugly\nYo we up in Jonesy's posin', all these niggas know me\nFrom fuckin' wit Un and these niggas, heavy parolees\nYo we played the speaker\nAnd from a distance we could see these chains\nThe P slayed, flat on his chest, was two plains\nAshy hands yo, no need for rings at all\nHe just cracked the V8 backed up, leaned against the wall\nLookin' flower, he just came home, he on like a fuck\nDid a dime for holdin' up the guards up in the armored truck\nTen years later son 280 on the weight tip\nHe throwin up six plates plus he studied Matrix\nHe's a wally horse shout it out sweatin through his valor\nCock-eyed nigga back up his neck he had shores\nSammy eagerly rode up on him, toxi off the turkey with the joint\nOn him\nFlower look his man stood up before him\nThe bitches hit the table, Jah king stripped off his cables\nShots went off, Sam'll get a chance to make his debut\nFlower grabbed Tiff his man with the sideburns, hat fell off\nWe noticed ring-worms, he hid behind Rich\nC-Allah hit the light switch, young girls were trampled\nIn the measured pool, pistol with Mase, and broke the handle\nDesperate crawlin to the door on all fours\nShim kicked the jukebox the theme song rode in was \"It's Yours\"\nOh my goodness, Ba grabbed the Mo bottle thrashin\nHe layin like a gay models shoutin out Sebastian\nHe smiled with his teeth missin begging for mercy\nNo more god, the 68 thousand down at pier 3\nOut came the cannon, whistled out zaggin\nCham snatched his flag four big rocks enter the dragon\nIt's over, another story told\nLyin' with the snakes, tongue kissin' cobras\n\nYo let me tell you how the game go\nWe gettin rid of all the prostitutes\nTony wants the streets back fo sho\nToo many hustlers, too many thieves\nWe're fuckin up who's willin to fight and teach the seeds\nToo much TV, guns and robberies\nLust and greed and hate the 4 devils jealousy"}}, {"title": "Mama",

tub\nPosted up in the back of the club, we doing it\nThat's a nice outfit on your back, don't make me ruin it\nFirst class, serving shots like a stewardess\nGun out the hoster, now come a little closer so you can view the fifth\nBlood stains, bullets'll drain you until you fluidless\nBarely escaped with the jaws of life, when your Buick flipped\nThat's how the game go, switch up, and change

all of these killas is taking action\nGang wars, yea, we bang to the death, gaining respect\nIn an intelligent city, be smart and wear ya vest\nWatch your right just as well as your left\nCuz nine out of ten times, we'll creep from behind and blow the tech\nHeat holding, whip stolen, while police is patrolling\nFlashing they lights, telling us to pull over, we keep going\nOn a high speed chase from the law, out on parole\nSwerving out of control, with the gas pedal to the floor\nI'm on a deathwish, driving wreckless with no headlights\nRunning through roadblocks, and we ain't stopping at red lights\nThat's how the game go, switch up, and change clothes\nWatch your back, when you walk through the streets of Saints Row, nigga\n\n\nEnter the real world, where corrupt cops and vigilante's lurk\nHenchmen, put in position to do my handywork\nMob bosses, hire hitmen, to get your family merked\nNo matter right or wrong, remember to put your family first\nWe in the gutter, watching for undercovers, slinging butter\nPosted up on the corners, me and my brothers\nSex, money and drugs, the hungriest thugs\nSleep with my burner, and wash with my gun in the tub\nPosted up in the back of the club, we doing it\nThat's a nice outfit on your back, don't make me ruin it\nFirst class, serving shots like a stewardess\nGun out the hoster, now come a little closer so you can view the fifth\nBlood stains, bullets'll drain you until you fluidless\nBarely escaped with the jaws of life, when your Buick flipped\nThat's how the game go, switch up, and change clothes\nWatch your back or

many men and took many lives\nLoyal brothers changed sides\nOnly birthed a decimal compared to those who died inside"}}, {"title": "Maxine", "album": "Bulletproof Wallets", "year": "2001-11-13",

After all, they can only hang you once\"\n\nBoth hands clusty, chilling with my man, Rusty\nLow down, blew off the burner kinda dusty\nThe world can't touch Ghost, purple tape, Rae co-host\nMonty Hall expo, intellect, you read pro\nSon trifling fuck, wildflower on the cycle and\nPicked up the broom thought I was Michael-in'\nWest Brighton Pool, now I'm into Iron Duels\nTurn Nuns to Earths Whoopi, she at Allah school\nInhale break beats of Hell A-Alikes propel parallel\nDuracell knot, you flash a burnt cell\nSnap out of CandyLand kids, the old rumor is\nBlacks become immune and shit, we never did\nLike eating dead birds, trust the pharmacy over herbs\nMen marrying men, ill they got the urge, pulsar\nScissor hand wig vanished in the winter, living off land\nYou god damn right I fuck fans, king me\nCheck checkmate props like the micro chip founder\nNeck to neck stock with Bill Gates now\n\nWhen we hug these mics we get busy\nCome and have a good time with G-O-D\nMake you snap your fingers or wiggle\nScream, shout, laugh or just giggle\nShake that body, party that body\nDon't fuck with Ghost you'll feel sorry\nThat's word, I'm not the herb\nUnderstand what I'm saying, saying, saying\n\nHit mics like Ted Koppel, rifle expert\nLet off the Eiffel, burn a flag in your grass, spiteful\nRingleader set it off, rap Derek Jeter\nCulprit, prince of the game wish you could see us\nWe lay low glitter wax full bangles\nPriceless ropes, lay around the God get tangled\nWoolly hair, eyes fiery red, feet made of brass\nTwelve men following me, it be the God staff\nMove, every script's like Miramax\nSmash the big boy, totalled it, Wilshire and Fairfax\nSon beaming wifey on the beach, sipping Zima\nWu 'binos to latinos, we love Selena\nOvernight, God schedules, Fed-Ex\nPretty silhouette velvet nice DNA scroll genetics\nToo hot to handle, one thought from scrambling the mandolin\nHundred game Wilt Chamberlain, smack 'em, say when\nHe rolling up, face wrinkled up, hands is on his nuts\nYo kid stop fronting on the ground 'fore you get touched\nIt's Canada Dry sess with Allah, son\nWe want rye, we want it so bad we might cry\n\nFor every blow, depends on breath control\nSo it's the first thing you must learn\nFortunately it's easy\nYou'll soon learn\nMy God so they are killers\nKilling and killing\nThey sort of develop a taste for blood", "image":

they sort of develop a taste for blood\"\n- \"Yeah, that's right. They kill one man, or kill ten\nIt's all the same (yes). After all, they can only hang you once\"\n\nBoth hands clusty, chilling with my man, Rusty\nLow down, blew off the burner kinda dusty\nThe world can't touch Ghost, purple tape, Rae co-host\nMonty Hall expo, intellect, you read pro\nSon trifling fuck, wildflower on the cycle and\nPicked up the broom thought I was Michael-in'\nWest Brighton Pool, now I'm into Iron Duels\nTurn Nuns to Earths Whoopi, she at Allah school\nInhale break beats of Hell A-Alikes propel parallel\nDuracell knot, you flash a burnt cell\nSnap out of CandyLand kids, the old rumor is\nBlacks become immune and shit, we never did\nLike eating dead birds, trust the pharmacy over herbs\nMen marrying men, ill they got the urge, pulsar\nScissor hand wig vanished in the winter, living off land\nYou god damn right I fuck fans, king me\nCheck checkmate props like the micro chip founder\nNeck to neck stock with Bill Gates now\n\nWhen we hug these mics we get busy\nCome and have a good time with G-O-D\nMake you snap your fingers or wiggle\nScream, shout, laugh or just giggle\nShake that body, party that body\nDon't fuck with Ghost you'll feel sorry\nThat's word, I'm not the herb\nUnderstand what I'm saying, saying, saying\n\nHit mics like Ted Koppel, rifle expert\nLet off the Eiffel, burn a flag in your grass, spiteful\nRingleader set it off, rap Derek Jeter\nCulprit, prince of the game wish you could see us\nWe lay low glitter wax full bangles\nPriceless ropes, lay around the God get tangled\nWoolly hair, eyes fiery red, feet made of brass\nTwelve men following me, it be the God staff\nMove, every script's like Miramax\nSmash the big boy, totalled it, Wilshire and Fairfax\nSon beaming wifey on the beach, sipping Zima\nWu 'binos to latinos, we love Selena\nOvernight, God schedules, Fed-Ex\nPretty silhouette velvet nice DNA scroll genetics\nToo hot to handle, one thought from scrambling the mandolin\nHundred game Wilt Chamberlain, smack 'em, say when\nHe rolling up, face wrinkled up, hands is on his nuts\nYo kid stop fronting on the ground 'fore you get touched\nIt's Canada Dry sess with Allah, son\nWe want rye, we want it so bad we might cry\n\nFor every blow, depends on breath control\nSo it's the first thing you must learn\nFortunately it's easy\nYou'll soon learn\nMy God so they are killers\nKilling and killing\nThey sort of develop a taste for blood"}}, {"title": "Miguel Sanchez", "album": "More Fish", "year": "2006-12-12", "lyrics": "Uh, thirty thousand feet up in the air, up in the lear\nDressed in a black tux, forty cal. tucked, strapped to the chair\nHalf asleep, hopping out of my seat, caught in the daze\nTurned around and seen a white man's face, covered in shades\nI must of passed out, can't remember shit before I blacked out\nThree more niggas approaching, holding they mack's out\nOne spoke, gave me the keys, to a boat\nReached in his trenchcoat, and pulled out a yellow envelope\nWhich contained twenty thousand in cash, a photograph\nOf a Colombian nigga with a long mustache\nMiguel Sanchez, keep a gun hidden in his pants leg\nWith armed bodyguards, surveillance around his land spread\nHe runs a billion dollar organization, under investigation\nPlus he's wanted by immigration\nNow I'm stuck, crazy look on my face, shocked in amazement\nHow the fuck I get involved with these federal agents\nThey knew my background, knew about what happened down in Sac Town\nThey knew about the wrap down south, they laid they backs down\nSaid I had two decisions, take out Miguel and his cartel\nOr spend the rest of my life in prison\nA classified mission on some James Bond shit\n007 style, love to get some straight convicts\nNow I'm pondering, my thoughts wandering, got my girl on the phone\nTold her to kiss little Jay cuz I'll be gone again\nHoney, I can't sleep, she sucking her teeth\nIf everything go good, baby, I'll be home in a week\nPinching myself just to see if I'm dreaming, call up my team and\nMeet me by the docks in Miami, I'll fly out this weekend\n\nI got you nigga, four-four pop two niggas\nThat drug lord that we want, got a spot for niggas\nAnd if we kill 'em, it's back to the block, my nigga\nHe carried rugers, thirty four shots I figure\nHe only holla at the kid, when there's money involved\nThey pack shotguns, hollow tips, dummies and all\nWhen me and Trife doing right together, got no choice\nBut give us ten, like we selling white together\nLeft side, four-five, right, black beretta\nTaking trips over seas, flipping packs for better\nEvery flight a hundred stacks and better, so grind hard\nGet ya money up, get on your grillies, don't mind odds\nFuck a cop car, throw on some chumpers, and drop charge\nHit the block hard, it's kinda hard being G-O-D\nIf he owe Trife, he owe me\nLoad up the mack grounds, M-I-A, call that the jack town\nTell niggas I'm on my way, coming back down\nMiguel, Mr. Sanchez, it's a wrap, now\nTheodore extorting your shit, handing out packs, now\nI used to listen to 50 and jam \"Back Down\"\nNow I slang fifty kilo's where I'm at now\nFifty a wop, purple top, nigga, I'm back, clown\nCrystal bottles, Grey Goose for the chat lounge\nChannel seven news, older

asleep, hopping out of my seat, caught in the daze\nTurned around and seen a white man's face, covered in shades\nI must of passed out, can't remember shit before I blacked out\nThree more niggas approaching, holding they mack's out\nOne spoke, gave me the keys, to a boat\nReached in his trenchcoat, and pulled out a yellow envelope\nWhich contained twenty thousand in cash, a photograph\nOf a Colombian nigga with a long mustache\nMiguel Sanchez, keep a gun hidden in his pants leg\nWith armed bodyguards, surveillance around his land spread\nHe runs a billion dollar organization, under investigation\nPlus he's wanted by immigration\nNow I'm stuck, crazy look on my face, shocked in amazement\nHow the fuck I get involved with these federal agents\nThey knew my background, knew about what happened down in Sac Town\nThey knew about the wrap down south, they laid they backs down\nSaid I had two decisions, take out Miguel and his cartel\nOr spend the rest of my life in prison\nA classified mission on some James Bond shit\n007 style, love to get some straight convicts\nNow I'm pondering, my thoughts wandering, got my girl on the phone\nTold her to kiss little Jay cuz I'll be gone again\nHoney, I can't sleep, she sucking her teeth\nIf everything go good, baby, I'll be home in a week\nPinching myself just to see if I'm dreaming, call up my team and\nMeet me by the docks in Miami, I'll fly out this weekend\n\nI got you nigga, four-four pop two niggas\nThat drug lord that we want, got a spot for niggas\nAnd if we kill 'em, it's back to the block, my nigga\nHe carried rugers, thirty four shots I figure\nHe only holla at the kid, when there's money involved\nThey pack shotguns, hollow tips, dummies and all\nWhen me and Trife doing right together, got no choice\nBut give us ten, like we selling white together\nLeft side, four-five, right, black beretta\nTaking trips over seas, flipping packs for better\nEvery flight a hundred stacks and better, so grind hard\nGet ya money up, get on your grillies, don't mind odds\nFuck a cop car, throw on some chumpers, and drop charge\nHit the block hard, it's kinda hard being G-O-D\nIf he owe Trife, he owe me\nLoad up the mack grounds, M-I-A, call that the jack town\nTell niggas I'm on my way, coming back down\nMiguel, Mr. Sanchez, it's a wrap, now\nTheodore extorting your shit, handing out packs, now\nI used to listen to 50 and jam \"Back Down\"\nNow I slang fifty kilo's where I'm at now\nFifty a wop, purple top, nigga, I'm back, clown\nCrystal bottles, Grey Goose for the chat lounge\nChannel seven news, older dude, murder gat found"}}, {"title": "Milk Crates", "album": "Hidden Darts: Special Edition", "year": "2007-03-13", "lyrics": "\"I've got the feeling..

hussled in a rain\nOld Earth, shootin' dope in her veins\nHe never had it all, the kid loved basketball\nHad a favorite song, \"I Miss You\" written by Aaron Hall\nNow back to the original,

clips be clappin\nSlept in expensive gold spreads, threads made of satin\nLabeled as the cow he had crazy beef\nSeen him at the flicks, he pulled out on Duke, Hez and Latief\nBut he fucked up, he shoulda kept it real and went for kill\nCuz if he don't, these niggas with black barrels will\nBut, shit never calmed down, one day downtown\nHe dropped an ounce off\nMoney had slept like a

your face\nBuried alive, throw a few nails in the case\nManslaughter, eight degrees of separation\nLeave your body chopped up into pieces, that's mutilation\n\nTorture, he's gruely peaking at the meeting\nSuspicions of him being a rat? Even worse than cheating\nI'm cold reaking of ice picks, scratch and sticks and closed fists\nBrassknuckle steel toe kicks\nCracked ribs, punctured lungs, hard breathing\nHe's gasping and wheezing for air, his breath he can't catch\nHe clinches the shirt on his chest\nIn a dying effort to reveal his last will before he was killed\n\nFirst things first, I chop your head then your fingertips\nButcher knife your torso, chop up your ligaments\nMake sure it's legitimate, conceal all my fingerprints\nChop shop your body up quick, then get rid of it\nA hole in the desert, body bag, just filled the ditch\nYour miss was a snitch too? Shotgun killed the bitch\nLeave her in the wilderness, suffocated and scarred up\nYour brother want more too, blow his fucking car up\n\nAnother homocide city, murder mystery efficiently\nDelete your fucking history, broke bones, missing teeth\nBlow bones to smithereens, brings on the triple beam\nAll topped and chopped up, mop buckets and Mr. Clean\nClorax and vicious steam sterilized the whole scene\nPhotograph your death so I can spread it to your whole team\nBut won't leave a trace of evidence for the case\nIt's sinister to finish it, hit with the man with no face\n\nSix million ways to die, cyanide in your drink\nCatch a Cuban necktie for your mink\nDahmer style, cut up and stuffed in the fridge\nAnd maybe washed up ashore and found under the bridge\nHit him with the whip, drag him half a block\nMachete or the sock full of padlocks\nChainsaw, switch your medication\nStomp a nigga out till he one with the pavement\n\nRed wine and pink veal\nUnknowingly that this would be his last meal\nComfortable he\u2019s made to feel\nSix inch stiletto heel, kept his refills filled\nTitties like big ass, kept him still for the real deal\nHitman from Brooklyn, Tommy gun specialist\nOur one accomplice, sipped Courvoisier at the bar\nThen waited till she lit a cigar, then sprayed\nIn shattered wine glass he laid, he never saw it coming\n\nYo, murder one, bullets went fast through the flesh\nI cocked the sawed off shotty, put a hole in your chest\nBlow your lungs out, I've seen you been smoking for years\nYou got no heart, I'll hunt you down like Cape Fear\nPush your brains out the back of your hat, blow off your hands\nLeave your body in a dumpster, head in the trash can\nCell catching scene look clean as a whistle\nGhost carved through your skin tissue, till the bone grizzle",

what I'm saying, I'ma just go\nI'ma just pack my shit\nPeace out, aight\nDon't worry about it\nI still love you though\n\nI'll never be the same again (I'll never be the same again)\nI'll bet you'll never understand (I'll bet you'll never understand)\nThe things you put me through (Ooooohhhh)\nI tried to be a better man (I tried to be a better man)\nBut you'll never understand, noooooo\nNow it's time that I move on (Move on!)\n\nEy yo I gave you everything and you still fucked my head up\nChildren (I'm sorry Ghost) Not now, shut up\nGot back off the road, heard you sleepin' with fam\nThe whole hood ran up on me, I was like \"Damn!\"\nSo I stepped back, sized the whole situation patiently\nArguments, face up in the air like you hatin' me\nAsk you one question, was it good?\nHe have you on the wall like me, was it hood?\nYou probably showed him your sexy faces, how you ride on top\nGrabbing the sheets, in a deep zone if he hit the spot\nI came home on Friday, Saturday I found out\nThat night I cried with the kids, I was out\nAnd my man, I'ma do him in\nAnd the Lord knows best what I'ma do to him\nAnd you can keep the crib - all I'm sayin' is\nLet me find out you got men around my kids\n\nI'll never be the same again (I'll never be the same again)\nI'll bet you'll never understand (I'll bet you'll never understand)\nThe things you put me through (Ooooohhhh)\nI tried to be a better man (I tried to be a better man)\nBut you'll never understand, noooooo\nNow it's time that I move on (Move on!)\n\nIt was the beauty that caught me and held my soul hostage\n'Member those days had you smellin' my boxes\nOld Gold up in the hood and Big Dup\nWe could push through the grimiest streets\nThen throw it up, like \"That's my nigga!\"\nAnybody got something bad to say\nSon'll come through and deliver\nBrushin' off his 88 clocks, y'all can't touch him\nI bet a wad on it, y'all can't fuck with him\nSemi-shy, and I'm laid back, crystal hats\nHeard ya water broke I was like \"Phewww\" and ran back\nI ran back fast, broke my arm in the mix\nTo find out that bird nigga tappin' my shit\nIt's alright 'do, maybe he came up with the right dough\nBigger dick, I don't know, must have been the best flow\nThis thing here, ever man in the world goes through\nBut fuck that, I put a lot of money up, I'm hatin'!\n\nI'll never be the same again (I'll never be the same again)\nI'll bet you'll never understand (I'll bet you'll never understand)\nThe things you put me through (Ooooohhhh)\nI tried to be a better man (I tried to be a better man)\nBut you'll never understand, noooooo\nNow it's time that I move on (Move on!)\n\nIt was like ecstasy girl\nFound out it was Disney World\nHad us living in a fantasy world\nI wish we never broke up, girl\nIt was like ecstasy girl\nFound out it was Disney World\nHad us living in a fantasy world\nI wish we never broke up, girl\n\nEy yo, you killed me with that, \"who bought this?\" I bought that\nKnowin' damn well in all reality you bought jack\nYou ain't lift one finger, but you claimin' what's yours\nRunnin' all through the house, bugged out, slammin' doors\nWe used to dress like twins - sweats, baby blue Timbs\nYou even scratched my Benz, let the pigs in\nYou think that I'm the biggest bird in America?\nCatch me on TV, I'm come back, never the...\n\nI'll never be the same again (I'll never be the same again)\nI'll bet you'll never understand (I'll bet you'll never understand)\nThe things you put me through (Ooooohhhh)\nI tried to be a better man (I tried to be a better man)\nBut you'll never

derbies)\nMasked avengers, (We're here to sharpen your sword)\nAll praises due to T.M.F., Wu-Tang Clan\n(Scream on it, Ghost)\n\nAyo, we at the weedgate, waiting for Jake\nWe want eight ravioli bags, two thirsty villains yelling bellyaches\nHeavyweight rhyme writers, hitting the grass that's the ripest\nPull out this kite from this white bitch\nTalking 'bout, \"Dear Ghost, you the only nigga I know\nLike when the cops come, you never hide your toast\"\nGuest starred in mad shit, CBL, Ice Water metallic\nPast tense placed in gold caskets\nDru Hill bitches, specialist lounging at the mosque\nSuede kufi wrap, undercover dentist\nRhymes is made of garlic, never in the target when the NARCs hit\nRumor is you might start to spit\nYou nice Lord, sweet daddy Grace, wind lifted\nOn the dancefloor, makeover's free followed by gauze\nDuncan Hines monument cakes, we never half-baked\nAlaskan, sexcapade, push your new court dates\nTrauma, hands is like candy canes, lay my balls on ice\nThe branches in my weed be the vein\nSwimsuit issue, darts sent truly from the heart, boo, I miss you\nSee daddy rock a wristful\nModern-day slave God, graveyard spells fog, get goggles\nLaying like needles in the hospital\nFive steps to conquer, ask Bernadette, Baguette swizzle\nZiploc your ear, hear thistle\n\nTo my real bitches take your drawers off\nTo all my high niggas, snatch her skirt off\nJust in case she wanna play, get up in that bitch face\nAnd tell her Ghost said, \"Take your clothes off!\"\n\nAyo, the Devil planted fear inside the black babies\nFifty cent sodas in the hood, they going crazy\nDead meat placed on the shelves, we eat cold cuts\nFast from the hog y'all and grow up\n\nAyo, crash through, break the glass, Tony with the goalie mask\nThat's the past, heavy ice Roley laying on the dash\nLove the grass, cauliflower hurting when I dumped the trash\nSour mash served in every glass up at the Wally Bash\nSunsplash, autograph blessing with your name slashed\nBackdraft, four-pounders screaming with the pearly ash\nChildren fix the contrast as the sound clashes\nMrs. Dash, sprinkle with her icicle eyelash\nAsk Cappa Pendergrass for backstage

cowboy hats and coach bags, they party like rockstars\nBo Gary watches, just chill, they down in the shark bars\nAnd me, gunslinger, clips, cock D\nMy fashion on, I'm rocking 'em new Rasheeds\nI'mma finish ya, go in brother like Mr. Cee\nYou could find me fucked up like the mice in cheese\nLife's a B, Bentley and big bills\nBottles, biscuits, bitches, blunts, bad boys bodying pit bulls\nKarate, black belt and I bring booze\nTo big bar brawls, ball games blasting, fuck 'til my balls blue\n\nWe like the black Yankees, old vets who sit in the rest\nThankful, counting up currency and move when it rain, pour\nFrom every bitch that we bless, we hit up, automatic love\nThe Cuban Link niggas is the realest\nMy wallet walk, speak to niggas, cops, judges\nWe put it down, Columbian style, with

more, nothing less\nPay respect, I'm a element of Homicide Housing\nIn other words, bitch, I'm the resident from Homicide Housing\nKnown for drug dealing, stack thousands\nFour hundred grand in the couches, two hundred grand on the houses\nAt any time I could move up out this\nAnd go and cop some shit up in the moutains\n\nAiyo, aiyo, you know ya boy stay fresher than produce\nTimberland snow boots, collecting more CREAM than a toll booth\nI grind daily, Patriotic like Tom Brady\nI'm the bomb baby, cuz what I write is beyond crazy\nI'm the Don with the teflon armor, good karma, mac

smooth keys from the piano\nChanged the mood, like we changed the channel\nThis is art, Picasso, I got him beat in the flesh\nI'm staring at beauty, Nefertiti, herring bone in the chest\nYes, everywhere she step, went off like a flare gun\nStilettos on, parquet floors\nMiss thing, she's a fierce one, two and three\nBad little mama, she built like Alicia Keys\nNo fa\u00e7ade, her strut is hard, based on books by\nIntelligent jail crooks, writing to let the time fly\nShe dropped the bracelet, I kneeled down\nPrestigious gentleman, with my right hand, I picked it up\nI stood up, to the

other day, I would of just let you, pass me by\nCuz I see you got situations\nAnd I've got mine, but baby its OK\nIt's alright, I'm not gonna let you pass me by\nCuz this was love at first sight\nCuz this was love at first sight\nIt's OK\n\nYou can tell he must be on a mission\nBecause my heart has made it's decision\nAs soon as you stepped in my peripheral vision\nI fell in love, sweet love\nAnd no infatuated 3D glasses to see\nThat your the one I need\nAnd the situation don't matter to me\nCuz this is love, it gotta be love\nLove at first sight"}}, {"title": "Paycheck", "album": null,

lot of wiz'es\nThey spoiled, told 'em they don't have to move drizzers\nWhatever they see, is none of they business\nI do what I do, to get that spinach\nWhether it's kill 'em, spray 'em, play 'em, all on the streets\nI weigh 'em, saute 'em, Ghost and Kay Slay 'em\n\nThis kid about his papers, paychecks\nThinkin' you can pay me now, any bear feelings, just say it\nGo 'head brother, just as fast as you front\nIt be an honor just to lay you down\n\nThe first check I ever got\nSon I spent it up top, blowin' a cop, cop, cop, cop, cop...\nI had 2 Cent, plus my car fare home\nIt wasn't even Broadway until I got those stones\nI was sixteen, shit, I barely knew what a gram was\nStudied Scarface, so I knew what the plan was\nTo get that CREAM, and serve them fiends\nAround the same time my nigga Buck converged with Beans\nTwo way team, posted up on the benches\nWit a magnet for a stash, that I kept hid under the black fences\nJakes shootin' through the middle, like Kerry Kittles\nI was baggin' up small hittin' fiends, with very little\nThough they switched nickels on niggas, and pointed out bitches\nIn the precinct got the snitchin', so they hit 'em off with something decent\nAvoid the sweeping, them boys is beastin'\nOn point, but I'm kinda paranoid when they creepin'\n\nFaggot ass niggas, when I ride get the f**k out the way\nWhen I see jewels, all I know is take\nI'm like a seed at a birthday party, all I want is cake\nIn other words, papes, sellin' herbs and tapes\nMovin' birds and weight, through suburban states\nGod damn it, I told ya'll niggas\nThis is a Theodore stickup\nWake ya bitch up, watch the fifth pick up!\n\nYeah, you heard what the bitch said\nWhen we wasn't makin' too much muthaf**kin' CREAM and shit\nWe was beatin' the shit out of niggas\nTakin' their little Summer Youth shit\nBuyin' beer and weed and shit\nShakin' niggas upside down on some cartoon shit\nChange fall all out of their pockets and shit\nYellin' and tellin' the cops, f**k ya'll

glazed up\nFace all sprayed up, on the floors\nThe left side of your cheek, go ahead and pick that face up\nOf course I'mma f**k with ya'll niggas, ya'll pussy (yeah)\nYa'll niggas know how Pretty Toney get down\nMade The Post in '98, f**k an album, when I need CREAM\nIt's on, nigga, faggots, better check out their accountants\nWhen I hung around broke niggas, and broke bitches\nYou know what that means, it equals no riches and\nI can't have that, I got a lot of wiz'es\nThey spoiled, told 'em they don't have to move drizzers\nWhatever they see, is none of they business\nI do what I do, to get that spinach\nWhether it's kill 'em, spray 'em, play 'em, all on the streets\nI weigh 'em, saute 'em, Ghost and Kay Slay 'em\n\nThis kid about his papers, paychecks\nThinkin' you can pay me now, any bear feelings, just say it\nGo 'head brother, just as fast as you front\nIt be an honor just to lay you down\n\nThe first check I ever got\nSon I spent it up top, blowin' a cop, cop, cop, cop, cop...\nI had 2 Cent, plus my car fare home\nIt wasn't even Broadway until I got those stones\nI was sixteen, shit, I barely knew what a gram was\nStudied Scarface, so I knew what the plan was\nTo get that CREAM, and serve them fiends\nAround the same time my nigga Buck converged with Beans\nTwo way team, posted up on the benches\nWit a magnet for a stash, that I kept hid under the black fences\nJakes shootin' through the middle, like Kerry Kittles\nI was baggin' up small hittin' fiends, with very little\nThough they switched nickels on niggas, and pointed out bitches\nIn the precinct got the snitchin', so they hit 'em off with something decent\nAvoid the sweeping, them boys is beastin'\nOn point, but I'm kinda paranoid when they creepin'\n\nFaggot ass niggas, when I ride get the f**k out the way\nWhen I see jewels, all I know is take\nI'm like a seed at a birthday party, all I want is cake\nIn other words, papes, sellin' herbs and tapes\nMovin' birds and weight, through suburban states\nGod damn it, I told ya'll niggas\nThis is a Theodore stickup\nWake ya bitch up, watch the fifth pick up!\n\nYeah, you heard what the bitch said\nWhen we wasn't makin' too much muthaf**kin' CREAM and shit\nWe was beatin' the shit out of niggas\nTakin' their little Summer Youth shit\nBuyin' beer and weed and shit\nShakin' niggas upside down on some cartoon shit\nChange fall all out of their pockets and shit\nYellin' and tellin' the cops, f**k ya'll niggas!\nThis is Theodore, bitch"}}, {"title": "Pieces of the Puzzle", "album": "36 Seasons", "year": "2014-12-09",

shit\nSo I took out his competition\nSo he's my competition, that makes my decision\nEasy, he gotta be the lord of the drugs\nAnd that's Bamboo's man, that's where he stands\nHe played both sides of the fence on some real-real shit\nCounterfeit thug, tryna play legit\nSeen the bars slide open as I bought off a bail\nI seen Bamboo waitin' as I exit the jail\nShe said, \"Please Ton', you gots to go\nYou can't stay around this part of town.\" Already know\nI'm blowin' bail, headin' up north, free in the country\nShe gave me a hug and a big stack of money\n x2\nSometimes you gotta figure out the pieces to the puzzle\nRight in front of your face, stop the hustle\nTake off the muzzle, let the dogs bark\nClear your mind, bring the light to the dark\n\nMy cash missin', my lab different\nWhere the fuck is Bamboo? She need an ass whippin'\nI was told Ton' was home, I'm way past fifth and\nGuess it's time to get in my zone, this my last mission\nDid what I could do with this pump and I'm like fuck it\nFeelin' like Hammer on crutches, he can't touch this\nIllustrious, multi movements\nI drew the blueprints but now it's time for improvements\nPress his peoples, left a message, nothin' peaceful\nShit police do, we could never be a equal\nExecution, I get it in, retribution\nBest solution, get up close when you're shootin'\nShit for realler, I'm mad raw with a killer\nWhat's even iller, I knew the boss since Thriller\n'Til we're even, I guess it's gon' be grievin'\nA lot can change in 36 seasons\n x2", "image": "https://images.genius.com/d574d4ae0fd1bf98f6ac441244ddbf96.1000x1000x1.jpg", "artist": "Ghostface Killah", "raw": {"annotation_count": 7, "api_path": "/songs/607698", "description": {"dom": {"tag": "root", "children": [{"tag": "p", "children": ["In this \u201cchapter\u201d of the album, Ghostface gets out of jail on bail and put the pieces together on who AZ is while AZ does the same with Ghost.

be the lord of the drugs\nAnd that's Bamboo's man, that's where he stands\nHe played both sides of the fence on some real-real shit\nCounterfeit thug, tryna play legit\nSeen the bars slide open as I bought off a bail\nI seen Bamboo waitin' as I exit the jail\nShe said, \"Please Ton', you gots to go\nYou can't stay around this part of town.\" Already know\nI'm blowin' bail, headin' up north, free in the country\nShe gave me a hug and a big stack of money\n x2\nSometimes you gotta figure out the pieces to the puzzle\nRight in front of your face, stop the hustle\nTake off the muzzle, let the dogs bark\nClear your mind, bring the light to the dark\n\nMy cash missin', my lab different\nWhere the fuck is Bamboo? She need an ass whippin'\nI was told Ton' was home, I'm way past fifth and\nGuess it's time to get in my zone, this my last mission\nDid what I could do with this pump and I'm like fuck it\nFeelin' like Hammer on crutches, he can't touch this\nIllustrious, multi movements\nI drew the blueprints but now it's time for improvements\nPress his peoples, left a message, nothin' peaceful\nShit police do, we could never be a equal\nExecution, I get it in, retribution\nBest solution, get up close when you're shootin'\nShit for realler, I'm mad raw with a killer\nWhat's even iller, I knew the boss since Thriller\n'Til we're even, I guess it's gon' be grievin'\nA lot can change in 36 seasons\n x2"}}, {"title": "Poisonous Darts", "album": "Ironman", "year": "1996-10-29", "lyrics": "Let's see you try the water technique!

ones\nMemorized by the glory, word life\nCut off niggas who killed good but couldn't do nothing for me\nShout 'em out every once in the blue\nAnd kid yo, I never rocked with\nLong as they keep away, we cool\nI devised my own stimulus plan, I'm nigga-rich\nI'm tired of eating those crumbs and black licorice\nTo free my mind on Friday, I cleanse in the mosque\nLet the imam pray over my head and wash\nThoughts, sterilized, purified, Godly\nWatch his gift manifest the green like barley\nIf that shit happen I'll feed his whole army\nTalking 'bout the angels and peeps in Somali\nTry to stay humble and swallow my pride\nIn God I trust, not talkin' 'bout the ones on your five\nCrisp dollar billing, catch me in a little hut in Benin\nVillage style, feeding the children\nBig pots of jasmine tea with Mandela\nAfricans chanting me on like Coachella\nGhostface Bumaye, Kumbaya my Lord\nMy death day, 24 karat tomb I lay\nWishing they could bury me next to the prophets\nNabi, Lut, Is'a, Musa, Hadrat Muhammad, Ibrahim\n\n\"Am I a good man?\" (I don't know)\n\"Am I a fool?\" (We'll see)\n\nThe Lord takes me, gathering speeds before winds\nHigh currents, distance, places be forming wings\nKings offering, thrones was there\nMan with the seven crowns on his dome was near\nFeet walked over rose petals sold from the ghetto\nFace froze in gold like the pharaoh\nAdorned in glory, robe of light, a power for his cherub\nAs He passed the path, white doves crossed the eyes of thugs\nEternal heartbeat and the dark fire in his blood\nSeven hundred books were opened\nEmbraced to write, then threw the crooks in the ocean\nSkin brass hair like it grew from goatskin\nThe chosen has spoken, tablets were broken\nThe smoke hand grabs an omen\nGravity grabbing me gradually, dragging me through Hell's cavity\nThis is blasphemy, I fell where the jackals feed\nGod felt bad for me but cast me in the Caspian Sea\nSatan gave the dragon his key, Wu-Family's the faculty\nK.P., K.P\n\n\"Am I a good man? Am I a fool?\n\"Am I?\"\n\nHe used to sling in the stairwell\nFast to put the rap on a thinking cap, ignite your hair gel\nNo such thing as the fair sale\nHe'll put the bullet out same day, delivery airmail\nAnd on this level a thug will sell your garbage\nNo refund, the only exchange from the cartridge\nBut the users just kept coming back with their life earnings\nReady to make a deal, soul and pipe burning\nThe outcome tragic, the household dramatic\nLiving rooms for heating spoons, basements for addicts\nSupport from a bean, hit the courts from a fiend\nWho betrayed one, who had lit the torch for his team\nSo he sent them gifts, body parts per diem\nIn a box that held prints but too dark to see 'em", "image": "https://images.genius.com/f48f03bc4acc3c9c4ddc676ddc586579.1000x1000x1.png", "artist": "Ghostface Killah", "raw": {"annotation_count": 20, "api_path": "/songs/3256", "description": {"dom": {"tag": "root", "children": [{"tag": "p", "children": ["The first track on  Ghostface Killah\u2019s 2010 album ", {"tag": "em", "children": ["Apollo Kids"]}, ", produced by Frank Dukes and contains a sample from  \u201cAm I A Good Man\u201d written by Willie Clarke, originally performed by Them Two courtesy of The Numero Group."]}, "", {"tag": "p", "children": ["Ghostface Killah talks thinks about his past his greed before talking about separating relationships with people that are street orientated.

ones\nMemorized by the glory, word life\nCut off niggas who killed good but couldn't do nothing for me\nShout 'em out every once in the blue\nAnd kid yo, I never rocked with\nLong as they keep away, we cool\nI devised my own stimulus plan, I'm nigga-rich\nI'm tired of eating those crumbs and black licorice\nTo free my mind on Friday, I cleanse in the mosque\nLet the imam pray over my head and wash\nThoughts, sterilized, purified, Godly\nWatch his gift manifest the green like barley\nIf that shit happen I'll feed his whole army\nTalking 'bout the angels and peeps in Somali\nTry to stay humble and swallow my pride\nIn God I trust, not talkin' 'bout the ones on your five\nCrisp dollar billing, catch me in a little hut in Benin\nVillage style, feeding the children\nBig pots of jasmine tea with Mandela\nAfricans chanting me on like Coachella\nGhostface Bumaye, Kumbaya my Lord\nMy death day, 24 karat tomb I lay\nWishing they could bury me next to the prophets\nNabi, Lut, Is'a, Musa, Hadrat Muhammad, Ibrahim\n\n\"Am I a good man?\" (I don't know)\n\"Am I a fool?\" (We'll see)\n\nThe Lord takes me, gathering speeds before winds\nHigh currents, distance, places be forming wings\nKings offering, thrones was there\nMan with the seven crowns on his dome was near\nFeet walked over rose petals sold from the ghetto\nFace froze in gold like the pharaoh\nAdorned in glory, robe of light, a power for his cherub\nAs He passed the path, white doves crossed the eyes of thugs\nEternal heartbeat and the dark fire in his blood\nSeven hundred books were opened\nEmbraced to write, then threw the crooks in the ocean\nSkin brass hair like it grew from goatskin\nThe chosen has spoken, tablets were broken\nThe smoke hand grabs an omen\nGravity grabbing me gradually, dragging me through Hell's cavity\nThis is blasphemy, I fell where the jackals feed\nGod felt bad for me but cast me in the Caspian Sea\nSatan gave the dragon his key, Wu-Family's the faculty\nK.P., K.P\n\n\"Am I a good man? Am I a fool?\n\"Am I?\"\n\nHe used to sling in the stairwell\nFast to put the rap on a thinking cap, ignite your hair gel\nNo such thing as the fair sale\nHe'll put the bullet out same day, delivery airmail\nAnd on this level a thug will sell your garbage\nNo refund, the only exchange from the cartridge\nBut the users just kept coming back with their life earnings\nReady to make a deal, soul and pipe burning\nThe outcome tragic, the household dramatic\nLiving rooms for heating spoons, basements for addicts\nSupport from a bean, hit the courts from a fiend\nWho betrayed one, who had lit the torch for his team\nSo he sent them gifts, body parts per diem\nIn a box that held prints but too dark to see 'em"}}, {"title": "Push", "album": null, "year": null, "lyrics": "Oohhh...

Raekwon)\nI'm in the crib watchin Larry King Live, the new Guccis on\nRefrigerator, smokin some kush, this nigga's a lighter\nSwisher, becoming a roach, go get the glass ashtray\nPour the glass of Cru, tap the bottle then toast\nBarrie took a sip for the cause, yeah my son\nSoon to be 3, tried to fill his bottle then run\nThen I got a collect call, heard niggas down the block is fighting\nSome nigga got knifed up brawling\nHeard the kid was 19, Little Infiniti too\nHis father worked up at the dealer he love Wu\nThey tried him for his Louis', son wasn't having it though\nYeah, yeah my nigga, the color of glue\nDecided i'mma intervene, guess who tried to wild on me my nigga\nThis is like out of the blue\nI'm in the Range stretch, jumped out, tucked the chain\nProceeded to talk to him, then you heard the heavy face slap\nThink I broke my wrist, now I'm at the hospital vexed\nFucked up my writing hand, that's my check\nNow I wanna kill this little nigga true\nOnly thing that stop my gun flaming cause he related to you\n\nWho? He ain't related to me\nJust that I knew him for like 18 years until he violated, stealing my gear\nIf my lil' homey, yo he eat anything for me\nSend him uptown, he get bagged, yo he never call me\nCome home and still blow cats for me\nPump crack, stabbing all them hoodrat shorties\nA live gunslinger well known, born to dance\nWhen the heat is on, Stapleton days, shot himself in the groin\nThe gun went off, it looked like a flick\nWhen he fell to the floor, holding his nuts, screaming \"God damnit\nShit I put one in my balls, what the fuck y'all looking at me for?\nCall the police, do something\nMotherfuckers standing around, watch when I get better\nAll hell's gonna be terror\nDeath to you, you,\" he pointed at Red\nI said chill, that's fam duke\nHe put real work in that make you puke, fuck that\nBut anyway son indeed, he stole two Polo rugbies\nSwore to his dead mother, I couldn't take it\nYo Lord I knocked out his teeth\nNow he's rocking those false joints like everything's peace"}}, {"title": "Rec-Room Therapy", "album": "The Big Doe Rehab", "year": "2007-12-04", "lyrics": "A'ight, now, this is how we gon' do this shit\nYou know'm sayin'?

resurrection morning\nThe light goes\nThe sacrifice\nThe glory of the Ghost controls the soul\n\nTime to surrender your physical being\nSo I can hear, touch, and smell, and start seeing\nLife as a precious gift given from God\nSo I can enjoy my seed and start healing these scars\nTake this knife and push it through your windpipe slowly\nCome on Lester Kane, you better show me\nYou a man of your word, fuck the criminal conduct\nYou gotta sacrifice your life or else your time's up\nHe took the knife, the look on his face got calmer\nI watched him take his life like a suicide bomber\n\nIt's time to go, I made a promise and I'm a man of my word\nFuck it, I'm a G and my bond will never swerve\nI dreamt about this time and this place and I swear I've seen it\nNow I'm face-to-face with a death angel\nThinking about the lies that I took with no strife\nStanding here holding a knife, now I'm 'bout to take my own life\nBut it's for a good reason\nMy spirit needs to be replenished so I offer my soul to be relinquished\n\nLifeless, his body left slumped in a chair\nIt was time to become one, but my mind wasn't there\nI wasn't sure if I wanted to walk this corrupt Earth\nSmell sweat instead of fear, give up my powers\nBe a simple man, let alone a ruthless killer\nCrime boss syndicate, another sinner\nMurderer, take lives like mine's was once taken\nOr leave my seed in this cold world, my heart's aching\n\nMan up soldier, no need to back it up now\nI'm in a large space, beauty queens feeding me grapes\nJewels all thick and clusty\nMe, the father, and rusty\nWhat's the matter talking about you're not sure anymore\nDid you lie to your brother Kane or did I die in vain?\nYou don't wanna be a sinner but sinning is in your veins\nYou a general, love the life of running in the city\nPretty women, lots of money, doing anything you want\nThink about it, me and you as one force\nThere's no limit to where we can take it\nTime is ticking, jump up in my corpse\nAnd be true living king that you are, you need to live again\nSo you can enjoy the fruits and shine like the stars\nDrink the finest wines and dine on exotic foods\nHelp the people who never helped, dropping a little jewels\nSon you hesitating - I didn't hesitate for you\nWhen it was my time to go, I cocked it and showed prove\n\nA resurrection morning\nThe light goes\nThe sacrifice\nThe glory of the Ghost controls the soul", "image": "https://images.genius.com/acf47354b3403ad918031650402ae958.1000x1000x1.jpg", "artist": "Ghostface Killah", "raw": {"annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/2163149",

start seeing\nLife as a precious gift given from God\nSo I can enjoy my seed and start healing these scars\nTake this knife and push it through your windpipe slowly\nCome on Lester Kane, you better show me\nYou a man of your word, fuck the criminal conduct\nYou gotta sacrifice your life or else your time's up\nHe took the knife, the look on his face got calmer\nI watched him take his life like a suicide bomber\n\nIt's time to go, I made a promise and I'm a man of my word\nFuck it, I'm a G and my bond will never swerve\nI dreamt about this time and this place and I swear I've seen it\nNow I'm face-to-face with a death angel\nThinking about the lies that I took with no strife\nStanding here holding a knife, now I'm 'bout to take my own life\nBut it's for a good reason\nMy spirit needs to be replenished so I offer my soul to be relinquished\n\nLifeless, his body left slumped in a chair\nIt was time to become one, but my mind wasn't there\nI wasn't sure if I wanted to walk this corrupt Earth\nSmell sweat instead of fear, give up my powers\nBe a simple man, let alone a ruthless killer\nCrime boss syndicate, another sinner\nMurderer, take lives like mine's was once taken\nOr leave my seed in this cold world, my heart's aching\n\nMan up soldier, no need to back it up now\nI'm in a large space, beauty queens feeding me grapes\nJewels all thick and clusty\nMe, the father, and rusty\nWhat's the matter talking about you're not sure anymore\nDid you lie to your brother Kane or did I die in vain?\nYou don't wanna be a sinner but sinning is in your veins\nYou a general, love the life of running in the city\nPretty women, lots of money, doing anything you want\nThink about it, me and you as one force\nThere's no limit to where we can take it\nTime is ticking, jump up in my corpse\nAnd be true living king that you are, you need to live again\nSo you can enjoy the fruits and shine like the stars\nDrink the finest wines and dine on exotic foods\nHelp the people who never helped, dropping a little jewels\nSon you hesitating - I didn't hesitate for you\nWhen it was my time to go, I cocked it and showed prove\n\nA resurrection morning\nThe light goes\nThe sacrifice\nThe

on lavish\nGhostface Killah, return of the savage\nIn the beginning, it's time for a new chapter\nTwelve more reasons to die, after the laughter\nIt's relevant, the legacy lives on lavish\nGhostface Killah, return of the savage\n\nI ain't letting nothing live, horrific the ghost risen\nStigmata scenery ill visions of being villains\nThe taste of blood is left on my tongue\nWalk through the valley of death\nI see the reaper waiting with two snakes kissing\nCan't believe they took my wife and my kids, and straight lynched 'em\nWord to God, once I get 'em, I got 'em, the moments priceless\nDecapitating heads like a journalist snatched with Isis\nI want revenge now!\nSpotted one of Delucas men, at a restaurant\nEating spaghetti, drinking on Dom P\u00e9rignon\nWith two other goons laughing, probably joking bout the murder\nI calmly approach them with the burner\nWhen they realized the real live G was about to serve 'em\n60 pieces blew through his jaw, closing his curtains\nNow it's total chaos, the people running for they lives\nThe other cocksuckers tried reaching for their hammers\nBut they was slow on their draw so I blammed 'em\nTaking they tops off like a convertible drop burgundy phantom\nThey say the taste of revenge is sweet, well let me see\nPrepare the table for a feast, take a seat, now let's eat\n\nIn the beginning, it's time for a new chapter\nTwelve more reasons to die, after the laughter\nIt's relevant, the legacy lives on lavish\nGhostface Killah, return of the savage\nIn the beginning, it's time for a new chapter\nTwelve more reasons to die, after the laughter\nIt's relevant, the legacy lives on lavish\nGhostface Killah, return of the savage\n\nBeast mode, I'm resurrected, I hear the record spinning\nEarly 70s, New York Kingpins\nAnd I see street life, the only life I know\nI see Liberty, I see the motherfucking Verrazano\nI see gangstas getting money, bitches acting funny\nStacks upon stacks, and not one nigga bummy\nSomething ain't right, these ain't the greedy streets of Italy\nWhere Logan and my seed? C'mon son, you kidding me?\nWho's calling me? Who's looking for the killer with no face?\nWho summoned me into this place? I need answers!\nBehave chancellors, I'm a vigilante killer\nNo time for games and there ain't no nigga realer\nLet's talk business, you don't wanna leak your own blood\nState your name, before you get stretched like a rug!\n\nAs the Ghostface Killah and the infamous gangster Lester Kane came face to face for the first time, they reflect on the violent events that forced their paths to cross. A black crime family led by Lester Kane has made a violent push for supremacy against the surviving members of the Deluca clan, now residing in New York City. In attempt to thwart his adversary advances, Luther Luca, the head of the Deluca clan, guns down members of the Kane syndicate, as well as Lester's wife and son. The war escalates. In one fatal night, Lester and his men rob one of the Deluca clan social clubs, discovering 12 vinyl records hidden within a safe"}}, {"title": "Revenge Is Sweet (Brown Tape)", "album": "The Brown Tape", "year": "2013-04-23", "lyrics": "You asked me to secure a place for you in history\nHistory is watching, waiting for a decision\nThis is your moment\n\nAyo, revenge is sweet, that's why I take my time with it\nLike good pussy I just stay when I'm up in it\nEvil plan, my mind functions well off spite\nI don't do that tit for tat, I blow your shit up like dynamite\nTake my life, I'll take every one you love\nHave your kids thrown out of a plane, \u201cLook out cuz\u201d\nMy plots are like movie scripts, they well planned\nSnatch you off the land and drop you off in the Sahara sand\nSo don't scam, don't try to double cross me\nMy Tennessee goons'll nail that ass to the cross, B\nRevenge mode, I live life by the sword\nAnd if you live by it, die by it, I'll still kill your horse\nSet me up, coming back, like a thief in the night\nI'll have a suicide bomber pop up on your flight\nYou couldn't take my life, my mask done resurrected\nAnd I'm Ghostface Killah, way more than you expected\n\nThose involved with this tale cursed the day they ever heard the name Tony Starks, and wreaked the day they heard the music was played from the records which comprised of his flesh\n\nYes, but what they didn't expect\nA hundred ghouls from the projects\nArmed and masked with flamethrowers and gas'll blast anything\nHung him by his tongue ring, till he gave the info on how we find his kinfolk\nMade him sign the ransom, then gave the note to his grandson\nBust the shot and made him run fast back to his family\nNews of his discovery would set off a chain of events\nThat would then lead to members of DeLucas to bleed with no exception\nThey sent the wrong message so kill everything, no exception to the media\nThere would not be a retire or cease fire till every Luca has expired, in entirety\nWishes of the god, Tone Starks to eternity, respectfully\n\nCutthroats, murder sprees, and killings were synonymous with his gangsta life before his passing. So it'd only seem fitting that it would become the embodiment of his new life\n\nI keep having flashbacks of blasting at you bastards, cutting outside the benches\nGot convicted of the gun charge and laughed at my sentence\nFour years, five flat post-release supervision\nFor niggas spitting in the wind, but that's what I get for missing\nSo soon as I hit the bridge again, niggas is finished\nNinja mode on a mission out to end your existence\nThink I'm sitting up in prison with a tin of L, in a cell, sick ass hell, listen\nEveryday is like Christmas, I miss my seed and my missus, but I see \u2018em on visits\nI ain't stressing over pussy, beat my dick to her pictures\nWhen they free me I'mma see you, leave you food for the fishes\nHope the Luca crew is in for the fixing, now get the henchman\nLine \u2018em up, Tommy gun \u2018em down, the muzzle extension\nTear they flesh off if one of \u2018em flinching", "image":

the streets strapped with two nines\nBitch smacking, jacking niggas, G dub stacking figures\nPolice drive by, I was click clacking triggers\nJay De Lucas put me with the fam to grow\nI was a boss amongst white boys rocking the 'fro\nI had hoes, bankrolls and minks by the dozen\nMy rise to power was quick, they just wasn't\nTryna make me a made man, they fucked up the game plan\nI blacked out on them and started my own clan\nBlack Gambino, black suits, black Syndicate\nMy crime fam was tight, every move was intricate\nThe coke was brought in from bad Colombian mules\nGorgeous women that I draped down in jewels\nStreets fight started, mafia wars in Italy\nCrime fam against fam and no one could do diddly\n\nDo the dirty work, bring in the coke by the boatloads\nGo against the grain, nigga, I feed nose holes\nFollow no family rules, rules are for fools\nChase the paper \u2018cause it's the cash that rules\n\nFuck the law of fam, it's the law of land\nYou don't like how I movin' then try to force my hand\nI'm moving keys, them DeLucas couldn't touch my pianos\nPutting pressure on them Gambinis and Verrazanos\nThey love my money, they hate to see a nigga getting it\nSelling drugs is taboo, but I ain't fucking sweating it\nThe dirt gotta get done so I took my position\nOne day I'm just Black Tone with a lot of ambition\nNext I got status, dinners with all courses\nFlights in and out of the country, they getting nauseous\nMoney, power, respect; rise of the black suits\nTalk shit behind my back, but to my face salute\nHugs and handshakes, they can't stop my reign\nGot the coconut, pilots bringing shit on their plane\nIt's a shame, they ain't have the balls to make moves\nThey pussies, couldn't walk a mile in my shoes\n\nDo the dirty work, bring in the coke by the boatloads\nGo against the grain, nigga, I feed nose holes\nFollow no family rules, rules are for fools\nChase the paper \u2018cause it's the cash that rules\nDo the dirty work, bring in the coke by the boatloads\nGo against the grain, nigga, I feed nose holes\nFollow no family rules, rules are for fools\nChase the paper \u2018cause it's the cash that rules"}}, {"title": "Rise of the Ghostface

Pull off quick, back up, hit the bitch, dog\nTurned down Hill, light the Marley spliff\nRun! I will not get bagged on a rock\nRun! I seen what happened to Un, they bad with they cops\nRun! They amp shit, plant shit, destroy evidence\nFuck a case, I'm not coming home with no 56\nDie with the heart of Scarface and take 50 licks\nBefore I let these crackers throw me in shit\nBounce if you a good kid, bounce, do the bird hop\nCurse, swerve to get served, these cocksuckers got nerve\nHeard I was killing shit, they must got word\nThat I told the chief of Rich Port I don't wanna merge\n\nRun! If you sell drugs in the school zone\nRun! If you getting chased with no shoes on\nRun! Fuck that! Run! Cops got guns!\nThey givin' out life like by the ton\nRun! If you ain't do shit, you it\nThat next felony, nigga, is like three zip\nSo, run! Hop fences, jump over benches!\nWhen you see me coming, get the fuck out the entrance!\nRun! Fuck that! Run! Cops got guns! Mothafucka\n\nAh-hah! I might gotta take my shirt off (yeah, kid...)\nI like that one (uh-huh, go in, go in!)\n\nYo, uh, it's Task Force Tuesday, the NARCS is in the black car\nI got five hundred hundred-packs in my backyard\nClear 12-12's that look like stuffed shells\nI'm cutting niggas' throats on the sales, while they puff L's\nDon't leave nothing unbagged, shave everything\nI learned from the OG's to save everything\nThey come by one more time, they gon' hop out\nThey two deep, and one is a bitch, she getting knocked out\nThen I can get rid of the pack. But I just copped this pretty chrome thing, so I'm dippin' with that\nUh, down-shifting on 'em like I got gears on me\n(Run!) Besides that, I got about 5 years on me\n(Run!) Scared to death, running like I got bears on me\n(Run!) My Timbs start feeling like they Nike Airs on me\n(Run!) It's hard for me to slow down\nIt's like I'm on the Thruway\nMy belt's in the crib on the floor by my two-way\nNow I'm trying to hold my hammer up, and my pants too\nIf they don't kill me, they gon' give me a number I can't do\nRather it be the streets than jail where I die at\nAnd I'm asthmatic, so I'm looking for somewhere to hide at\nBut they too close, and I got this new toast; imagine if I

They amp shit, plant shit, destroy evidence\nFuck a case, I'm not coming home with no 56\nDie with the heart of Scarface and take 50 licks\nBefore I let these crackers throw me in shit\nBounce if you a good kid, bounce, do the bird hop\nCurse, swerve to get served, these cocksuckers got nerve\nHeard I was killing shit, they must got word\nThat I told the chief of Rich Port I don't wanna merge\n\nRun!

ain't hear nothin'\nBuggin', only thing I remember was the bullshit summon\nSo I stopped at the 2nd floor, ran across, cracks is fallin'\nMy pockets is lean, clean when I vanished off\nTook off, made track look easy\nThe walkie talkies them D-E-T's had, black, they was rated P.G\nRun, I will not give up, no, quick flag the car down\nTake me to.. Ghost here they come now!\nErrr! Pull off quick, back up, hit the bitch, dog\nTurned down Hill, light the Marley spliff\nRun! I will not get bagged on the rock\nRun! I seen what happened to Un, they bad with they cops\nRun!

gotta catch Dr. J's\nBlow on my hand, rub on my nose\nTap the glass, stop fronting Duke, fresh pair of jeans\nLook I got loot, eleven in the beige boots\nHeard a screech pull up, these Jakes flashed me five pictures\nOne had my man's mug, Semi stepped brother hugs\nYou asked the wrong guy son\nI'm from Atlanta, yeah we know Mr. Coles\nFlew in two days ago to see his fam'\nBut we been watching you, crazily\nThe whole Staten Island shitting on you\nWisdom Bird's pregnant out in Baisley\nHolding snow in your ear, fresh baldie tried to change up\nNot truck today, still looking fly, still slammed up hung\nYou mind popping your trunk, slow your pace\nStarks fixed your face, copped out the six, five years probash'\nYou dealing with a lot of science, motherfucker we're watching you\nMake me wanna lick shots at you\nYou disgust me, screwing me down, grab my gun\nGo head bust me\nHeard you hate Jake that's what it must be\nHands behind your back, spread your legs\nJust found a roach in your tray\nIt's not mine fucker, what I said\nYou make the 13th nigga\nA multimillion dollar operation is based upon it yo\nWhere the hell's the RZA\nHe's selling mics, wireless joints\nSpecial made to go off in your hand and which went out on point\nSwitched to the next scene, I'm at the crib bugging out\nOn how po' live, hating plus harassing the kid\nPark the truck in the double face garage\nDial 1-900-Raekwon, tell the God shit's mega real\nFlashing me on BET, Planet Groove, Rap City News\nNAACP committees {\u200b\u200b\u200b*abruptly ends*}\u200b\u200b\u200b"}}, {"title": "Save

her wish, one of my wig pushed in\nGhostface is local, slick murder shit with a new rhyme hustle\nStill bust you, f**k you, head bust you, respect my muscle\nLike a mean hooker, I'm not gonna tussle, I'll cut you\nAnd that goes for any nigga who think that they better than me\nPunch in his face, f**k him up mentally\nReal robe and pop my throne\nPop a cop if he show signs of any kinda stop my flow\nThis is real life lyricist, never a witness\nSee me clappin' the tools, improve my wrist\nThe dude is, the ruger is super steel\nFall back, take a look at my face, for real\nMy attempts to kill, sent a gate to chills\nWhen his brain hit the windshields, brake ills\n\nBurn it it, aw, burn it\nAnd you know, got to have them set it\nBurn it, aw, burn it\nWhat a life, not a life, ha, ha, ha,

kiwi fruit\nDead serious, showin' no teeth, holdin' my heat\nPut his eyes in the back of his head, he goin' to sleep\nFor f**kin' with a top boss, niggas get knocked off\nI always drop shit for the streets like a cop's horse\nNigga you cock soft, scared to pop off\nAnd I spit fire, my tongue's dipped in hot sauce\nIt'll burn you, toss and turn you\nHave you bleed internal, get popped like

bodies\nBlood mixed with the rain ran through the gutter\nThat's the work of a tommy\nBut then I heard it was the work of a mami\nSpanish chick bad, about five six, long hair, red Jag\nKinda bowlegged, Chanel sweatpants, she thick\nShe love her some pussy, don't really give a fuck about dick\nThat's when I got the call, yo Tone come to the shop\nSome fire jumped, chill I'm about to pull in the lot\nLowered the tunes, pulled the Benz keys out the ignition\nBrushed the ashes off my blazer then finished my Guinness\nSo then I walked in, seen the God shufflin' cards\nSpades game, it's goin' down, he lost a couple of yards\nPeace Lord, how your physical?\n\nHe upstate miserable\nStressed, doin' a thousand sets\nBut yo check the visuals\nI'm at this hotel in Queens\nMe and Charene getting' slow necked\nThat's live, I couldn't finish the bean\nGotta a phone call, seen the whole bitch face fall\nDope fiend look like the bitch swallowed an eight ball\nThey talkin' about killin' ya man's and them\nThat kid from Staten, his jewels is tough, his robes is satin\nYo that's my heart Tone; yea yea he killed the captain\nWhat nationality nigga? The kid was Latin\nIt happened uptown, broad day, right in Manhattan\nI was shoppin' with my home girl, Leona with acne?\nBut you know what, Flaco meets Lolita\nFlew in, she from Medellin, he deaded her uncle over them seventeen bricks\nNiggas ain't slick, niggas is dicks\nY'all got beef for life now cause that bitch is a trick\n\nAy yo fuck that, close the gate\n\nAnd lower the shade\nThen a shot popped off\n\nHit lil' bro in his fade\nAnd then I see him dropped his clippers\n\nHe dipped with the quickness\nIt was Lolita black down yo\n\nWith four other bitches\nHe had a nasty hammer, fat ass\n\nHer tits was bananas\nYo the clip was ninety shot\n\nShe lit up the cameras\nSo then I bugged out, ran up the steps\n\nYo I got hit in the leg\n\nHe shot back, hit one bitch in her breast\nUnder the pinball game aimin'\n\nIt's foggy and rainin'\n\nMy jewels is clangin'\n\nYo Tone tuck your chain in\nShe shootin' like she wanted a payment\nThrowin' bullets like Joe Nameth, yellin'\n\nYo it's all entertainment\nWhere y'all girls at? Where ya'll pussies at?\nThought y'all bang on Gaten Island?\nI killed three things on Staten Island\n(Guns firing)\nTake that!\nYou fuckin' with me huh?!\nThat's all you got babyyyyyy?\nHold that! Motherfuckaaaaa!\nYea! You on Staten Island now nigga!\n\nNow where the fuck is your brain at now ho?\nYou fuckin' with me, brains is all over the wall like Velcro\nI fuck your pussy while you die slow\nWake up! You cock suckin' ass maricon\nThat's what you get for killin' Frankie\n(Police loudspeaker)\nTony Starks, Tony Starks drop you weapons now\nPut your weapons down or we will shoot\nAy yo Rae I got this\nI ain't surrenderin', they gon hang me\nYou know what it do, yo I love you\nSay peace to my kids, say peace to my wiz\nI ain't goin' to jail\nFuck it's on G, let's get...FUCK Y'ALL NIGGAS!"}},

to shorty but her ass ain't big enough\nHer friends look like the type that'll just give it up\nFrom abyss to gecko, stay bumrushing them hoes like Joe Klecko\nIt's hard to get a ticket like the Funkmaster Flex show\nEven fat girls get twist into pretzels, Toney Starks special\n\nShe's a killer (oh) she's a killer (oh)\nShe's a killer, mami, you'se a killer\nShe's a killer (oh) she's a killer (oh)\nShe's a killer, shorty, you'se a killer\nOh, hop in my four wheeler, oh, ain't nobody realer\nOh, you got a man, I'mma steal ya, oh, my ice is iller\nYeah, we drinking Patron and, put your

to try how good her sex is\nBaby's shit wiggle like J-Lo, her thing so good\nBefore you hit it, you be having to pray, yo\nDon't wanna bust fast, best be on your J-O\nShe strictly dickly, don't go both ways, yo\nShe independant and she fly\nBout 5'5, 5'6, bout yay high\nButton-up pink boss shirt, blue necktie\nEvery nigga in the club wanna eat that thigh\nSurprise she stay on her toes like a prized ballerina\nShe tight, her stomping grounds is out in Medina\nThis pretty thing handle her biz, she carry those things\nReady to die like she related to B.I.G\n\n (Shawn Wigs)\nEverybody's acting like they killing the town\n(Pardon me lord, I was sipping that brown)\nThis goes for the rappers, non-gun clappers\nYo, Wigs, get the cameras these is a bunch of actors (action)\nYet, my heat sing like Shirley Caesar\nYou can come test me at, your own leisure\nI'm ballin', gettin' Arab money and I pop champagne\nAnd go hit shorty, shaking that thang, cuz"}}, {"title": "Skunk Fu!", "album":

that, I was getting it on\"\nYou done slept on Tony\n\"Tony Starks!\" \"Ironman\"\nYou done slept on Tony\n\"I was getting it, getting it, getting it on\"\n\nYo, when they kidnapped your boy, and forced me to do evil\nI created an iron suit, to protect my people\nEscaped, bound to be Ironman the great\nThe billionaire Tony Starks'll renew your fate\nBuilt Stark Towers, throw the biggest events\nGot liquid, armor, I can paint all dents\nKeep a few bad chicks, I ain't your average hero\nMovie premieres, catch me with the zam enginero\nSix six eleven gold, playboy industrialist\nFace of a ghost, mind of a technologist\nSpecialist, modern day speech slang therapist\nScecialize in weapons, I can blow off terrorists\nSo, so don't sleep big homey\nReal recognize and I can see you phoneys\nMy weak heart can't take it, got a life long sentance\nBoy genius grown up, and I fight with a vengeance\n\n\nYo, I got steel toe wallies when I glide on stage\nAnd my heart gently weeps in an iron ribcage\nPunctured by metals, replaced by elements\nMy enemies hunt it like a tusk on the elephant\nExtraordinary, hiding my duel identities\nAnthony Stark, call me Ton', the top pedigree\nMulti-billionaire, military contractor\nCrushing my opponents, with the strength of a compactor\nEx-factor, I turn liquids to metals\nWater to wine, I turn dirt into rose petals\nGreatest man walking, blow a bottle of Goose\nGoldy plat iron armor, to Versace suits\nI'm so elegant, scientifically intelligent\nMy lawyers won the case, I won't take the settlement\nMoney's irrelevant, I need heat to energize\nWe taking over the planet, Stark Enterprise\n\n\nOnce again, Tony Stark, infinite finesse\nStopped the planet, and destroyed an indestructable track"}}, {"title": "Slow Down",

This just, just what I do\nOn the streets, y'knahmean?\nBabies need Pampers, man\nYouknowI'msaying? I don't know\nI think about it, I think about it, yanahImean?\nMy responsibilities, I've gotta focus more\nYou might be right though, you know\nMaybe things'll start coming to me naturally, you feel me?\nStarting praying more, youknowImean? Be with the family more\nAnd, I might live longer, you feel me?\nWord... you... just feel like you right, though\nI don't know...

another jail, and his banger is old fire\nHe's locked up with them dudes from the fucking Wire\nThat's when I passed her the bone, started to cough\nAnd flossed all through the house, robe on, ruger out\nHomebuyers see the sign, yeah ya'll, I'm moving out\nIn front of the crib, niggas flipped, I had to shoot it out\nThirty G, living room sets, porcelain plates\nWith big giant wall units, even the front grass\nSaw your boy doing it, Tone Stark he'll never fall\nI even put work in, under the floor\nIn the box with the ox, and my skeleton jaw\nTell 'em soldiers I'm in the bush if the President call\n\nGet 'em, the'll be nothing but smooth sailing\nWhen the heat shot, now your crew's bailing\nI refuse to bow down, refuse to lay down\nGo five and turn, to let the biz, all I found\n\nWhere the fuck is the kids crown?\nLady luck breathing all over the dikes\nWith 745 airlines, the color of Cajun rice\nThis the passion of Christ, done seen it and felt it all\nTil rats shit in my boots, like how the fuck the rats get in my boots\nA brown metal that sizzles, wrap up more dead meat then riddles\nInjuries that have you missing more games than Kerry Kittles\nThere's a war going on outside, you hear the fiddles?\nAnd you so called 'units', go 'head and jump\nAnd get your body severed apart with pumps\n\nAiyo, watch who you talk around, cuz ya'll seen niggas snitching\nAnd they quick to turn on you like keys in the ignition\nNiggas start submitting, when them slugs is spitting\nAnd believe me, that shit'll hurt like when your drugs is missing\nYo, these bullets ain't thug resistant, and they see a nigga dying\nChoking off his own blood is sickening\nPicture that, now picture this, picture me running in your lab\nLike Allen Iverson waving the fifth\nBut this ain't no domestic dispute, go 'head and get cute\nForce my hand, and see if I'm connected with loot\nSomebody gon' find your body on the stitching of the roof\nThe art of gunplay, I stay perfected when I shoot\nAnd this ain't a lottery, but ya'll dudes can 'take seven'\nThe slugs'll have your ass 'burning up' like Faith Evans\nFacial expressions change when you're facing that weapon\nNigga, your ass gon' die,

cell, sparking the L\nBaby mother reading my mail, just that they switched seats\nTo another jail, and his banger is old fire\nHe's locked up with them dudes from the fucking Wire\nThat's when I passed her the bone, started to cough\nAnd flossed all through the house, robe on, ruger out\nHomebuyers see the sign, yeah ya'll, I'm moving out\nIn front of the crib, niggas flipped, I had to shoot it out\nThirty G, living room sets, porcelain plates\nWith big giant wall units, even the front grass\nSaw your boy doing it, Tone Stark he'll never fall\nI even put work in, under the floor\nIn the box with the ox, and my skeleton jaw\nTell 'em soldiers I'm in the bush if the President call\n\nGet 'em, the'll be nothing but smooth sailing\nWhen the heat shot, now your crew's bailing\nI refuse to bow down, refuse to lay down\nGo five and turn, to let the biz, all I found\n\nWhere the fuck is the kids crown?\nLady luck breathing all over the dikes\nWith 745 airlines, the color of Cajun rice\nThis the passion of Christ, done seen it and felt it all\nTil rats shit in my boots, like how the fuck the rats get in my boots\nA brown metal that sizzles, wrap up more dead meat then riddles\nInjuries that have you missing more games than Kerry Kittles\nThere's a war going on outside, you hear the fiddles?\nAnd you so called 'units', go 'head and jump\nAnd get your body severed apart with pumps\n\nAiyo, watch who you talk around, cuz ya'll seen niggas snitching\nAnd they quick to turn on you like keys in the ignition\nNiggas start submitting, when them slugs is spitting\nAnd believe me, that shit'll hurt like when your drugs is missing\nYo, these bullets ain't thug resistant, and they see a nigga dying\nChoking off his own blood is sickening\nPicture that, now picture this, picture me running in your lab\nLike Allen Iverson waving the fifth\nBut this ain't no domestic dispute, go 'head and get cute\nForce my hand, and see if I'm connected with loot\nSomebody gon' find your body on the stitching of the roof\nThe art of gunplay, I stay perfected when I shoot\nAnd this ain't a lottery, but ya'll dudes can 'take seven'\nThe slugs'll have your ass 'burning up' like Faith Evans\nFacial expressions change when you're facing that weapon\nNigga, your ass gon' die, try to escape within sessions"}}, {"title": "Stand Up", "album": null, "year": null, "lyrics": "Be

surprise you\nCross my heart, swear, put my hand on the bible\nI'm not a cold blooded killa, baby, I cry too\nThe best thing for me is when I'm laying beside you\nTurn you over, open up, get up inside you\nHe a woman beater, no doubt, and he lies too\n\nStay, a little longer (please, baby, just one last time)\nI know you have to go home to him (I know you got to bring it out, though)\n\nWhen you

take you out tonight)\n(Go to clubs thats popping)\nI know you have to go home to him (come on, let's go get our one-two\nOn, come on)\n\nAiyo, baby, don't leave, cuz the club is popping\nWe got grandma yay, plus the tunes is knocking\nOn the dance floor, I'm sweating my ass off\nImagining us in deep lust, how you look with your pants off\nMy one-two step, your dress is so spun\nAnd your neck smell good, look cute when you chewing your gum and\nFrom the womb to the tomb, you're blessed with a killa walk\nYou don't have to give me none, it's ight, we'll talk\n\nSomeone who loves you\nOnly

rounds\nActin' like, what a way to play these clowns\nSome shady town guerrillas tryin' to lay me down\nYo maybe Brown, done set it up, who give a fuck?\nWe vested up, from head to gut, them niggas won't get the best of us\nThey talk to me, silently they stalk with me\nAwkwardly, till they seen my two ninas\nFiendin' let us out of these jeans, would lean'em , leave 'em\nCoughin' and bleedin' even, barfin' and wheezin'\nSon they- called for it, we at odds, and we gon' make it even\nBurning Season long 4 keep pourin' on the heat Lord\nThe more beef they bring Killa, the more steak to feast off\nOne shot nearly took a cheek off, should've seen him leapin'\nDancin' like Ed Norton catchin' a smack from Jackie Gleason\nBloody Mooners episode 1 where weapons get spun\nAnd those who gamble with them hammers'll surely death will become\n\"Get over here woman!\"\n\nYo, nigga, pass the mothafuckin' Belvedere, nigga\n(Ain't no fuckin' Belvedere)\nWhat the fuck is that? Grey Goose, nigga?\n(It's water, man, water)\nYo, where the fuck is Tony at, man?\nHe in the room right here?\n(Chill son, chill son, chill son\nHe gettin' his dick sucked\nA bitch suckin' his dick)\nNot again, B (Damn, nigga)\nYo, Tony! (Yo baby, chill, chill)\nYo, hold up (A bitch suckin' his dick)\nOh shit, son, she slurpin' and burpin'\n(Fuck that) Listen, listen, listen, listen\n(Oh shit he gettin' his dick sucked)\n\nFive and a half in boys (Uh-huh), ass is off the hook (word)\nHigh school pussy, heard you got the best nookie\nSugar walls, rocks o' love, slide right on my dick\nI'm palmin' ya ass like this while you ridin' it\nI'm about to cum boo-boo, chill for a sec\nI Feel it at the tip, ma' (gushing sound), ya pussy's too wet\nOne false move and I'mma blast like the very first time\nBurnt you with candle wax fast while you was slobbin' mine\nDick is sensitive, you moved, baby here it is\nOh Lord, I told you not to move, you dumb broad\nCumin' for days, wettin' ya cage\nMy dick is like the sprinklers and maybe a douche, I'm here to save the day\nSolomon was wise and I got fifty other bitches\nSome eat bitches, some bitches fuck my niggas\nSolomon was wise and I got fifty other bitches\nSome eat bitches, some bitches fuck my niggas"}}, {"title": "Street Bullies", "album": "Apollo Kids", "year": "2010-12-21", "lyrics": "Geah!

York\nRegulation party, daddy hard body\nRowdy Brighton God-body\nSmooth like a leather bop, '83 hip-hop\nTop of the world, get it rizzight\nDick to your wizzife, murder cats for the right prizzice\nFour-hundred and fifty-six on the dizzice\nThis is real lizzife, ain't nothin sweet God\nSit down and think it through God\nCuz comin all outta ya face'll get ya clap God\n\nYou are now listening to the sounds of Supreme Clientele\n\nStep in to the party, it's me\nGod Almighty, Ghost still holdin that shotty\nDust and Alize', three-quarter Timbs\nTerry-cloth robes, crisp hundreds in the envelope\nDookied on the globe, thank God for my Wallabee shoes\nThey done saved me, up three-nothin and Salt Lake City\nBurgundy minks, whips with sinks in em\nBrocolli blown, illa disease breath, elephant skin\nMeet the black Boy George, dusted on my honeymoon\nBitch like my wife, she popped my Ghostface balloon\nBitches think that I'm Dominican, slaf-hash Indian\nMilk on my mustache, drop to my chiny-chin\nDive into dangerous parts, buildin with thirsty mammals\nWhite man scream, \"Swim Starks sharks!\"\n\nSmack the jail bail bondsman strength of eighteen bronz men\nTall like Karl Malone \"Mailman\", frame of Larry Johnson\nTony Montana blow, creamy white Havana Joe's\nOld Suzanna ho, pussy sweet, banana flow\nDavid Banner, gamma ray shots, beast will marinate\nBones splittin' fatal Wu sword style, amputate\nDuck Savanna wait, we splashed the glass, ice rocks\nOur cash high right stock, our logo's on your rice box\nPlus your dice box, on the side upon your white socks\nBobby got the mic cocked, BUCK BUCK, nice shot"}}, {"title": "Sucks for them", "album": null, "year": "2016-07-20", "lyrics": "I'm sorry, this song does not exist", "image":

Ghost\nWell, surprise mothafucka, Starkey Love got breakfast\nGot some steaming hot biscuits, you can eat this toast\nShots blow through ya meatloaf and lace ya back\nTurn you over like a pancake and take ya gat\nThat's not damn near the half of it\nCops came, said the Killahs ain't risk game and the flow's so accurate\nAnything's possible, black, you mad profitable\nWaste no time, breath, air on popping you\nPut you on the guest list, go dance with death\nThe club's dead, yeah, you right, you the last one left\nSee the spooks in, goths in, devils in, fire's in\nYou dwelling in hell where them snitch niggas lyin, friend\nYa skin start bubbling from in the hot oven\nSay peace to my man down there, K-Dozen\nIt's Ghost, pressing y'all clowns on the regular\nDead you on a five pack, then take ya cellular\nDon't get it twisted, black, cuz I'll bury ya\nThis is just weed money, the more, the merrier\n\nThey call me the Superman lover\nSaid, they call me the Superman lover\nYeah, plus I'm wrong...\n\nAiyo, G4 jets with like three and four pets\nSex, Beck's, chicken and hens, all the same sex\nWalk through the Amazon, spilling Dom, Moet\nTo find my way back I gotta leave a trail of baguettes\nMy tongue's like a four-pound, my game is ill\nTwist a chick like a Rubik's cube, now what's the deal?\nChocolate, light skin, meet Mr. Excitement\nGot my D.D.L. on me, that's my Dick 'em Down License\nNever wife 'em, strike just like lightning\nI stay piping, hype just like Hype is\nBitches wanna see me and my rhinestone drawers\nCall in sick at work, then they take off\nFor me, spread 'em out for Starky\nMy mouth makes music like Biz Markie\nI get it in like any car key\nMy stroke is on, I'm never rusty\nUh-uh, but if you wanna play, this is what you gonna say\nThat I got the best D, he could hit it all day\nSomething like a rising star that's on Broadway\nSex real live with a Illmatic foreplay\n\n + (sample)\nOh shit, it's that Bally, it's that slick Bally\n'88 material, little niggas don't know nothing about this though\nCheck it out y'all (look) come on (look) yeah, come on\n(Up in the sky) When I'm at the bar, or in a rented car (look)\n(You'll see me flying by) Ya see the jewerly truck, don't touch\nYeah, yeah, come on, when I'm in the streets\nMight show you the heat (look, flying straight past ya)\n\n + (sample)\nToney Starks Radio (something ain't wrong with me)\nMama got a big butt, mama got a big butt\nToney Starks Radio right here\nMama got a big butt, mama got a big butt\nSmooth FM, you know how we do, come on\nWave ya hand in the air

ain\u2019t the same, shit is lame\nNo familiar faces son, I\u2019m dodging the game\nI want a clean slate, but these cops stay screwin\u2019\nSnatching me up off the block, what am I doin\u2019?\nOh, it\u2019s officer Dingle and his sidekick Berry\nDriving me around the hood so I could worry\nSee how fucked up it is there\u2019s crackheads on every corner\nKids in the schoolyard smoking marijuana\nI ain\u2019t feeling it, this ain\u2019t the way I left these blocks\nAnd my name\u2019s faded out like some old damn socks\nI want respect, these streets was my playground once\nI was the Mack across 110th on these stunts\nNot once would a nigga test me or gets zesty\nI would walk down the street and sneeze, they all blessed me\n\nBeen on the battlefield for a long, long time\nI can see life closing in on this old body of mine\n\nYeah, homie, I\u2019m the kingpin called Future\nMake a killin\u2019 in these buildings in the millions, got \u2018em feeling like Brewster\nShit hot as Fallujah, kids grown now, they cock Rugers\nWelcome back to the sewers, where new whips maneuver\nNo kids playing, no safe and sound havens\nThere\u2019s tre pound cases, on the playground pavement\nNo more dudes with 22\u2019s, in their sneaker soles\nKids tote shit that leave your body, with a heap of holes\nI\u2019m that neighborhood blizzard, flooding these streets with snow\nHeavy iron on the ready, my shit\u2019ll crease your clothes\nKeep a flock of sweetest hoes, yeah, I sleeps with those\nLittle slum young Keisha Coles with cheaper clothes\nUndercovers all around the gutter, they creepin\u2019 low\nI stays ahead, kid, I toss bread like pizza dough\nI keep the tef' around my torso with the piece below\nThat bulldog short nose, G be at peace w,ith those, you know?\n\n\nMama Bear was a church woman, pop\u2019s skated off\nI was impaired, an introverted youngin\u2019, a lot changed my course\nFrom nowhere to my first onion then them cops came across Flashed the badge, took my stash, told my little ass get lost\nThrew me off when my grind was prime time then\nYou could step on and stretch mine\u2019s to a nine times ten\nI was gone, remembering though that fine line\u2019s thin\nSo I studied that chessboard and we were all blind men\nDealers ran the streets, but the D\u2019s ran them\nI was a killer underneath, but needed expansion\nSomething to constitute being high in a coupe\nThe cries from my youth so I applied for the suit\nSalute to the enforcer, call me officer now\nSupporter of paraphernalia, I toss it around\nThe link to the cartel, costs is down\nIt\u2019s that Denzel in training day shit, caution my grounds"}}, {"title": "The Center of Attraction (Brown Tape)", "album": "The Brown Tape", "year": "2013-07-23", "lyrics": "Well

Blow out the windows, set flames\nTurn the pilots on, set up bombs by the maze\nBlow brains, tie niggas up to the radiators\n\nThey ain't gladiators we gon' crush 'em\nPush 'em to the edge, bomb rush 'em\nYou know how we do. OG style I dress like the pizza man\nAnd when they answer the door you come out the van blazin'\nFlame-throwing niggas like shish kebabs\n\nToasty, roasty, they be like Ghost be crazy as shit\nThey fucking with the wrong one\nSon of a gun, I make murdering fun\nYou took my baby, my block, and corrupted my hood\nI'm a do it for my hometown, New York understood\nI see laboratories, chemicals and shit\nThey cooking right here on the block. I'm throwing a fit\nDestructo, destroying houses like wreckin' balls\nCrushing your foundation you sit somewhere, inspect the fall\n\nChill.

Hey yo, Tone. Wake the fuck up\nThe chemical burns on his face, I wanna throw up\nI hugged him, felt his heart beatin', his chest breathin'\nFuck the police, son, I ain't leavin'\nScooped him, threw him in the van and split\nTook him back to the crib and shit, we gon' fix it\n\nHey yo, get him (I got 'em)\nWe gon' rock 'em\nTry dealin' shit on my block, you got a problem\nIt's Tony Starks and Money Migg, the OG's\nSchoolin' niggas in these streets with no degrees\n\n\"Yeah.

trenches\nWig, young black green beret\nChrome laser guns blazing at spades\nWallabies, cherry noose, kool-aid\n10 niggas call it Tai-Chi\nBlack blades, one hundred dollar seats\nHold up, we at the opera\nQueen Elizabeth rub on my leg\nHad ketchup on her dress from a whopper\nChunky ass necklace\nMust be her birthstone\nJohn Paul cop the biggest stones outta Rome\nSo Charles, eyes up on her prince\nFucking with Diana\nTwo rows across, Dirty giving hickeys to Vianna White\nFingering Pamela Lee\nWe on the balcony\nDare one of ya'll to Malcolm X me\nSomebody might catch a Kennedy\nYo let me adjust my lens\nThrough these binoculars\nI paid 5 g's sliding off like Kid Vitamin\nViking\nPatriot of Broad Street\nBet you think I'm laying like a hyphen\n\nTony Starks make the narc's dogs bark\nWith the Benz parked\nUp against the boulevard\nStarks had the bone sparked\nOne cop tapped the window glass\nLike a cymbal crash\n\"What the fuck son! You trying to break glass?\"\nHe flashed his badge\n\"License and registrations\"\nAt that moment\nHis fat partner started chasin'\nChicken heads they was racing wit' they hearts pacin'\nFor snatching gold\nTrying' to dip into the god's basement\nOur location\nLead steel shed spread\nCracked shorty head\nLeft sweetie there for dead\nGhetto poodles\nFingers sticky from cheese doodles\nStarving' for a 50 cent bag of Oodles and Noodles\nNeighborhood sick wit' it\nClinton 'bout to cut WIC\nMaybe one ya'll rich rap niggas need to politic\nReach for the sky\nThey throw bleach in your eye\nDon't teach you why\nYou be keeping 'em high\nDipped like an Oreo cookie\nIn cold milk, bold silk\nGold-filled cap, Wu wear hat\nLow tilt\nTrue Islamic\nWe speak verbal rhyme phonics\nWhy ya'll trying to change this hip hop to technotronics?\n\nDon't go against the grain (the grain)\nDon't go against the grain (the grain)\nDon't go against the grain (the grain)\n\nGirl\nBecause of you I'm hurting\nWithin my within my heart\nI know it's not right to be flirting\nBut a relationship has to start\nYou're the one that I'm clocking\nIt's time for you to start jocking\nDon't want you to see me cry\nThis is why this is why this is why\nI met this girl named Rhonda from way down yonder\nHey yo god don't fuck with her\nI met this girl named Liz she was all in the biz\nHey yo lord don't fuck with her\nI rocked a ho named Tina from the heart of Medina\nHey yo kid don't fuck with her\nYea that girl Kit Kat she got the good poodle cat\nHey yo nigga you better fuck with her<>"}}, {"title": "The Hilton", "album": "Bulletproof Wallets", "year": "2001-11-13", "lyrics": "(Raekwon)\nThis Nigga just bought eleven machine guns\nAnd he brought them in my crib\n(Ghostface Killah)\nGlittered out, stout face, tec, Rae up in the Hilton\nHeard Nia Long is in the building\nPenthouse fashion, ordered out room service\nIt looked bugged cause the waiter looked nervous\nLift off the lid, seen two shiny thirty-eights aimed at the kid\nWhat I do, duck!\nRae up in the shower singing\nSon don't know that it's real\nComing looking like he about peel something\nIn a tight jam, red down, matching like santa\nIf I could just reach my hammer\nHe bust two shots, I played mice\nRan to the spot were the sun was at, quickly he was blinded by the ice\nThat's when Rae ran out of the back\nTowel on, soap on his arms, spit duke around, fell on my lap\n(Raekwon)\nYo, what the fuck happened?\n(Ghostface Killah)\nIt was a set up to get wet up\n(Raekwon)\nStarks you're bleeding\n(Ghostface Killah)\nNah, his blood fucked my white leather up\nTen G's down the drain\nYo hurry up, we got to get him up\nGet the sheets son, let's fix him up\nLock the door, turn the TV off, your kicks is near the light switch\n(Raekwon)\nJust give me two minutes to iron my shirt, find my ices\n(Ghostface Killah)\nThe hit came quick\nHit the jack, star six\nGhost\n(Raekwon and Ghostface Killah)\nPut down the phone stupid\nWipe off your prints\n(Ghostface Killah)\nRae ran hysterically\nSlipped on soap\nLanded on his back, with his gat, now that's dope\nWe got three minutes, nobody seen shit\nSomebody might have heard shit\nSinging on some Martin, were my momma bird shit\nFuck your socks, that's when we heard the door knock\nEverything all right? Party here, sir, balloons popped\nThrew this dude under the bed\nA half dressed Raekwon, swallowing diamonds\nHad money in juice up on his wedding day\nThe phone rang off, the tea kettle blew, wifey hitting me\nWhat you want sweaty, lima beans and kidney\nTrashed the beeper, slowly I reached for the reefer\nThrow a Costa, peep oh son the house keeper\nSoap suds dripping from his nuts, cut up gut\nPraying how me make it out the telly untouched\n(Chorus - Ghostface Killah)\nFuck it, a Wesley Snipes movement on a Sunday in Bermuda\nWe laptop niggas, thugs in a computer\nCaught up in the grimy shit\nFinding two days later a murder and we got to make this flight shit\nIt was a Wesley Snipes movement on a Sunday in Bermuda\nWe laptop niggas, thugs in a computer\nA Wesley Snipes movement on a Sunday in Bermuda\nWe laptop niggas, thugs in a computer\n(Raekwon)\nAyo, the pressures on, sonny got murk\nIts time to move fast\nAyo, Deini it's on, check out the news flash\nFlew out the next day, back to the Tony estates\nBlew on the first class flight to L.A\nIt ain't take long, I pulled a few strings on the horn\nSo where it came from?\nThat nigga we stuck and took the caine from\nWe should have killed him when we had him\nYo I was holding a Magnum\nYeah we bagged him, but we let him slide in the wagon\nHis bad little brown ho, from out Chicago\nShe move his cargo, good at handling Roscoe's\nWe had our eyes closed God, we should have seen it coming\nHe should have seen me coming, running out the shower gunning\nNow that I figured it, she put the waiter on\nIt all came to me, in back of my mind, just like my favorite song\nDawned on me later on\nBy then the day was gone\nHow dare this nigga even think that he could take us on\nSmoke the Cee Allah\nSent the kite through the Pens\nHim and big Dan\nKnown to split wigs, with razor sharp gems\nGiants from Attica riots\nHalls is quiet\nCO's with babies on their arms look tight\nAnd this nigga from down state got shipped up north\nStocky young fella, running his lips on how he set it off\nThen heard that shit, plus got that kite\nMoney got murdered in his bunk that night\n(Chorus)", "image":

is in the building\nPenthouse fashion, ordered out room service\nIt looked bugged cause the waiter looked nervous\nLift off the lid, seen two shiny thirty-eights aimed at the kid\nWhat I do, duck!\nRae up in the shower singing\nSon don't know that it's real\nComing looking like he about peel something\nIn a tight jam, red down, matching like santa\nIf I could just reach my hammer\nHe bust two shots, I played mice\nRan to the spot were the sun was at, quickly he was blinded by the ice\nThat's when Rae ran out of the back\nTowel on, soap on his arms, spit duke around, fell on my lap\n(Raekwon)\nYo, what the fuck happened?\n(Ghostface Killah)\nIt was a set up to get wet up\n(Raekwon)\nStarks you're bleeding\n(Ghostface Killah)\nNah, his blood fucked my white leather up\nTen G's down the drain\nYo hurry up, we got to get him up\nGet the sheets son, let's fix him up\nLock the door, turn the TV off, your kicks is near the light switch\n(Raekwon)\nJust give me two minutes to iron my shirt, find my ices\n(Ghostface Killah)\nThe hit came quick\nHit the jack, star six\nGhost\n(Raekwon and Ghostface Killah)\nPut down the phone stupid\nWipe off your prints\n(Ghostface Killah)\nRae ran hysterically\nSlipped on soap\nLanded on his back, with his gat, now that's dope\nWe got three minutes, nobody seen shit\nSomebody might have heard shit\nSinging on some Martin, were my momma bird shit\nFuck your socks, that's when we heard the door knock\nEverything all right? Party here, sir, balloons popped\nThrew this dude under the bed\nA half dressed Raekwon, swallowing diamonds\nHad money in juice up on his wedding day\nThe phone rang off, the tea kettle blew, wifey hitting me\nWhat you want sweaty, lima beans and kidney\nTrashed the beeper, slowly I reached for the reefer\nThrow a Costa, peep oh son the house keeper\nSoap suds dripping from his nuts, cut up gut\nPraying how me make it out the telly untouched\n(Chorus - Ghostface Killah)\nFuck it, a Wesley Snipes movement on a Sunday in Bermuda\nWe laptop niggas, thugs in a computer\nCaught up in the grimy shit\nFinding two days later a murder and we got to make this flight shit\nIt was a Wesley Snipes movement on a Sunday in Bermuda\nWe laptop niggas, thugs in a computer\nA Wesley Snipes movement on a Sunday in Bermuda\nWe laptop niggas, thugs in a computer\n(Raekwon)\nAyo, the pressures on, sonny got murk\nIts time to move fast\nAyo, Deini it's on, check out the news flash\nFlew out the next day, back to the Tony estates\nBlew on the first class flight to L.A\nIt ain't take long, I pulled a few strings on the horn\nSo where it came from?\nThat nigga we stuck and took the caine from\nWe should have killed him when we had him\nYo I was holding a Magnum\nYeah we bagged him, but we let him slide in the wagon\nHis bad little brown ho, from out Chicago\nShe move his cargo, good at handling Roscoe's\nWe had our eyes closed God, we should have seen it coming\nHe should have seen me coming, running out the shower gunning\nNow that I figured it, she put the waiter on\nIt all came to me, in back of my mind, just like my favorite song\nDawned on me later on\nBy then the day was gone\nHow dare this nigga even think that he could take us on\nSmoke the Cee Allah\nSent the kite through the Pens\nHim and big Dan\nKnown to split wigs, with razor sharp gems\nGiants from Attica riots\nHalls is quiet\nCO's with babies on their arms look tight\nAnd this nigga from down state got shipped up north\nStocky young fella, running his lips on how he set it off\nThen heard that shit, plus got that kite\nMoney got murdered in his bunk that night\n(Chorus)"}}, {"title": "The Ironman

took it\nOff like a koufi, the fit was a bit doofy\nHe tried to get screwy, with that \"two for you\nOne, two for me, G,\" cut the cranky attitude\nWet him like a handkerchief on a stanky fatter dude\nWhether you's a rapper or dang sanger\nOnce you in the zone only one way out, like a gang banger\nWith a new crew keychain and street name\nWhat set do he claim for fame, peep game\nJust to keep feta and stay dip\nYou need it like a letter or better a getaway whip\nThis old things rusted, encrusted as the gold rings the old kings busted\nPlan to end global starvation and fat her\nNow what in tarnation did I go and do that fer?\nStuff happens, like gettin' snuffed for tough tit rappin'\nSee, I told 'em enough, quit yer yappin'\nThe same applied to any and all chumps\nThe only question he had for y'all is how many lumps?\nThree or four? either or? mon cheri amour\nSee, why you need your heater for?\nThe super villain slid in your party for free\nWarn a emcee, get outta here kid, you bother me!\nThe day I took my mask off my face was missin' for two days\nFor the record, G, came back a year later, whole new identity\nTony Starks pedigree, my money green like my nickname was celery\nWho is Ghost who flashes toast, never wore sheets but bulletproof coats\nOh no! the fans cry for the mask back on\nTold 'em \"Ghost is dead, he'll return at the crack of dawn\"\nFew years from now, him and his pals before the Jetson-era arrived\nHe'll be back summertime, 2000 and 5, with a half a face iron\nThe other half water look like alien science\nIn the summertime, you can see the face boil\nBut the other side I keep blue with the Penzoil\nMad loyal, when the wintertime come, (what?)\nI get stuck 'cause my brain all numb\nLike I ate a thousand icee's and frozen Pepsi's\nAquaman's pops can't water-check me, disrespect me, indirectly\nI seen his feet and they both lefty, he's steppin' half correctly\nAs I stroll the globe and terrorize the planet\nWith a Bill Clinton mask and them Playskool hammers\nMe and DOOM, always be the best on the landin'\nSuperhero's for life, until our souls vanish", "image":

bit doofy\nHe tried to get screwy, with that \"two for you\nOne, two for me, G,\" cut the cranky attitude\nWet him like a handkerchief on a stanky fatter dude\nWhether you's a rapper or dang sanger\nOnce you in the zone only one way out, like a gang banger\nWith a new crew keychain and street name\nWhat set do he claim for fame, peep game\nJust to keep feta and stay dip\nYou need it like a letter or better a getaway whip\nThis old things rusted, encrusted as the gold rings the old kings busted\nPlan to end global starvation and fat her\nNow what in tarnation did I go and do that fer?\nStuff happens, like gettin' snuffed for tough tit rappin'\nSee, I told 'em enough, quit yer yappin'\nThe same applied to any and all chumps\nThe only question he had for y'all is how many lumps?\nThree or four? either or? mon cheri amour\nSee, why you need your heater for?\nThe super villain slid in your party for free\nWarn a emcee, get outta here kid, you bother me!\nThe day I took my mask off my face was missin' for two days\nFor the record, G, came back a year later, whole new identity\nTony Starks pedigree, my money green like my nickname was celery\nWho is Ghost who flashes toast, never wore sheets but bulletproof coats\nOh no! the fans cry for the mask back on\nTold 'em \"Ghost is dead, he'll return at the crack of dawn\"\nFew years from now, him and his pals before the Jetson-era arrived\nHe'll be back summertime, 2000 and 5, with a half a face iron\nThe other half water look like alien science\nIn the summertime, you can see the face boil\nBut the other side I keep blue with the Penzoil\nMad loyal, when the wintertime come, (what?)\nI get stuck 'cause my brain all numb\nLike I ate a thousand icee's and frozen Pepsi's\nAquaman's pops can't water-check me, disrespect me, indirectly\nI seen his feet and they both lefty, he's steppin' half correctly\nAs I stroll the globe and terrorize the planet\nWith a Bill Clinton mask and them Playskool hammers\nMe and DOOM, always be the best on the landin'\nSuperhero's for life, until our souls vanish"}}, {"title": "Theodore", "album": "Bulletproof Wallets", "year": "2001-11-13", "lyrics": "Generals on deck,

stackin' figures\nPolice drive buy I was click calckin' triggers\nJay DeLucas put me with the fam to grow\nI was the boss amongst white boys, rockin' the fro\nI had hoes, bank rolls, and minks by the dozen\nMy rise to power was quick they just wasn't\nTried to make me a made man, they fucked up the game plan\nI blacked out on em and started my own clan\nBlack gambino, black suits, black syndicate\nMy crime fam was tight every move was intricate\nThe coke was brought in from bagged Columbian mules\nGorgeous women that I draped down in jewels\nStreet fights started, mafia wars in Italy\nCrime fam against fam and no one can do didely\nDo the dirty work\nBring in the coke by the boat loads\nGo against the grain nigga, i feed nose hoes\nFollow no family rules, rules are for fools\nChase the paper cause it's the cash that rules\nFuck the law of the fam\nMr. law of the land\nYou don't like how i'm moving then try to force my hand\nI'm moving keys them DeLucas couldn't touch my pianos\nPutting pressure on them gambinees and varazanos\nThey love my money they hate to see a nigga gettin' it\nSellin' drugs is taboo but I ain't fuckin' sweatin' it\nDirt got to get done so I took my position\nOne day I'm black to em with a lot of ambition\nThe next I got status dinners with all courses\nFlights in and out of the country they gettin' nauseous\nMoney, power, and respect\nRise of the black suits\nTalk shit behind my back but to my face salute\nHugs and handshakes they can't stop my reign\nGot the coke in they collars bring the shit on the plane\nIt's a shame they didn't have the balls to make moves\nThey pussy couldn't walk a mile in my shoes\n(Hook) x2", "image": "https://images.genius.com/227de22e535416c2ec2a6f012f37c9ef.620x400x1.jpg", "artist":

jackin' niggas, g-dub stackin' figures\nPolice drive buy I was click calckin' triggers\nJay DeLucas put me with the fam to grow\nI was the boss amongst white boys, rockin' the fro\nI had hoes, bank rolls, and minks by the dozen\nMy rise to power was quick they just wasn't\nTried to make me a made man, they fucked up the game plan\nI blacked out on em and started my own clan\nBlack gambino, black suits, black syndicate\nMy crime fam was tight every move was intricate\nThe coke was brought in from bagged Columbian mules\nGorgeous women that I draped down in jewels\nStreet fights started, mafia wars in Italy\nCrime fam against fam and no one can do didely\nDo the dirty work\nBring in the coke by the boat loads\nGo against the grain nigga, i feed nose hoes\nFollow no family rules, rules are for fools\nChase the paper cause it's the cash that rules\nFuck the law of the fam\nMr. law of the land\nYou don't like how i'm moving then try to force my hand\nI'm moving keys them DeLucas couldn't touch my pianos\nPutting pressure on them gambinees and varazanos\nThey love my money they hate to see a nigga gettin' it\nSellin' drugs is taboo but I ain't fuckin' sweatin' it\nDirt got to get done so I took my position\nOne day I'm black to em with a lot of ambition\nThe next I got status dinners with all courses\nFlights in and out of the country they gettin' nauseous\nMoney, power, and respect\nRise of the black suits\nTalk shit behind my back but to my face salute\nHugs and handshakes they can't stop my reign\nGot the coke in they collars bring the shit on the plane\nIt's a shame they didn't have the balls to make moves\nThey pussy couldn't walk a mile in my shoes\n(Hook) x2"}}, {"title": "The Soul Controller", "album": "Ironman", "year": "1996-10-29", "lyrics": "Whoaahhhoahhh, oahhhohhhhh\nIt's been a long, long\nA long time coming\nA change gon' come\n\nYo, yo these streets got me backed down how can I escape?\nHow can I survive without bubblin

part of Queens\nBut at the same time, niggas on the block is ill\nSome'll rock you to sleep, hap, for selling cross pills\nBeing watched all day like enemy's prey\nFaces, you never seen before is in your hallway\nBrothers you knew for years is mad pussy and scared\nBack in the days U.F.O.'s couldn't walk up in here\nIt's time to motor, travel like a foul order\nClear my head, stay sober, the soul

there\nIn that great big ol' sky\n\nSink deep into the fog, big buffalo large\nTaj Mahal just got banged, shanked for eighty large\nIt's hard to keep up, with these key-ons, that smoke dust\nIn the U.S. Mint they went to rock the place and call the rush\nAll these shameless niggas armed with cherry-red Bally's\nOn the twenty-fifth, everybody rich is gettin married\nKilled for power beans, your brother own schools in Medina\nVaseline lips is cracked cause they all had dreams\nThey overdue, these Gods own a mosque in Peru\nTropical trees and weaves where they grew bamboo\nOlympic minds quick flash like a leak on\nA hundred shares short to own Nissan, watch em get they feast on\nRoyal blue lies inside the eyes of heaven\nCurse the head, who speak foul and jinx number seven (seven)\nClear my head and stay sober, the soul controller...\n(Stay sober, the soul controller)\n\nOahhh, been a long time comin\nOh yeah\nA change gon' come\nWoooaahh, yes it will\n\nYo, yo we sit and play the wall like nine super heroes\nLate for the man choose and hit socks and stereo\nThe kid's nice, warnin you twice, run your garmets\nJet to Providence, switch up and bag down your Parliament\nIronman is laced with a plate inside the dome piece\nGo off in airports, biographies, prophecies\nWatch me set it, real key-ons hold down the desert\nAnd walk with a famous name like Supreme Magnetic\nCarbon copy, I love my Akai snare choppy\nMelachi off the funky pen with the wax poppy on instrumentals\nNiggas get lost like S.S. Minnows\nTurned out like rentals, keep gold around the denim\n\nA change gon come\nYes it will\nIt's been a long, long\nA long time coming\nA change gon come\nWooo, yes it will\nSaid I'm so\nTired of living\nBut I'm, but I'm afraid to die\nCause I don't know what's up there\nIn that great, big ol sky\nOh my, oh my, oh my\nIt's been a long, long time\nA long time coming\nChange gonna come\nWooo, yes it will\n\nSorry boys\nAll the stitches in the world can't sew me together again\nLay down, lay down\nGonna stretch me out in Fernandez funeral home on hun and ninth street\nAlways knew I'd make a stop there\nBut a lot later than a whole gang of people thought\nLast of the Mohicans\nWell, maybe not the last\nCan't come with me on this trip, Loaf\nGettin the shakes now\nLast call for drinks\nBar's closin down\nSun's out\nWhere we goin for breakfast?\nDon't wanna go far\nRough night\nTired, baby\nTired...\n\nGreatest trick the devil ever pulled\nWas convincing the world he didn't exist\nAnd like that, he's gone", "image": "https://images.genius.com/86aaa4a25c81fd34a671c2db7083cc80.800x800x1.jpg", "artist": "Ghostface Killah", "raw": {"annotation_count": 7, "api_path":

we had three more of you\nI adore you, plus I even go to the store for you\n\n\nI would die for a sun , can being richer and cruel\nReachin a full 98, and got the kids in the pool\nIsn't it cool how it spreads joy, hons lay in it\nAnd it's hard to go back to work, when your lunch breaks finished\n? before, so it's a fact I support\nFeeling the warm sun rays, upon your back as you walk\nThe

a leader against us\n\nRecord spins, I'm going in\nI don't shoot to kill, I play to win\nStay catching up with the cutthroats\nSome men shoot a nigga, throw 'em off the tugboat, no floats\nThe body sinks to the bottom\nOr left off the side of the road to smell rotten\nThe murder sprees, random killings\nGhostface Killah's back attacking villains, hanging from the ceilings\nGodfather motives, gangsta mentality\nBlack superhero with the immortality\nForever, I be creeping in a black mist\nIll night vision with the militant tactics\nI glide through the air like a swarm of bees\nShake niggas off quick like a dog with fleas\nRaw meat, leave bodies slumped in the street\nRevenge is the spice of life, it's so sweet\nAy yo, pipe bombs blowing they souls to Jesus\nDon't need nothing but the puzzle glue for the pieces\nMeat cleaver cut finger tips like rib tips\nHome invasions, cars gonna flip, DeLucas lose\nPair of cement shoes, tossed in the ocean\nPopped until they brain ooze, I won't lose\nBlood all on my apron, hog tie 'em up while they try escaping\nPeeped the visual, tied 'em up individual\nTook their clothes off, season 'em like sausage\nLet the pits out to eat 'em, that's the remedy\nAttack, kill, bite off their extremities\nBlood bath splash my name on my wall\nCall it piece delivery, leave a tip on the stall\nWith an arm, leg, a head, I'm coming for you all\n\n\nUh-huh, it's the sure shot, yo, yeah\n\nHeart of a lion, king of the jungle\nI'm a humble killer bee, you as soft as a bumble\nI don't crumble, I strike back hard with a vengeance\nAttack through these killer words I spit in a sentence\nI'm a menace, the black Clark Kent, caped crusader\nThe face of a ghost, I disappear in the vapors\nYou could murder my flesh and bone, soul's invincible\nRevenge my death, payback's the main principal\nProtect ya neck when you move, I be lurking in the shadows\nStarks, the gangsta nigga, I never lose battles\nPimp bitches with a superhero logo on my chest\nBig Gucci link, GFK on the crest\nIcy arm for the eagle with the eight carat ruby eyes\nPiss on your motherfucking lawn while I'm stupid high\nAll black down, royalty purple and some ice chips\nTwo Glock 9's pointed at you in a hype flick\n\nNow I'm alone in the room, and I just stare at the wall\nRevenge my death but I'm going through withdrawals\nMy lost niggas, I miss them this new power and wisdom\nGot me thinking I've made a whole lot of bad decisions\nGot Logan still to deal with, should I kill her?\nThrow her fuckin' ass in a cage with a gorilla\nOr let her live and treat her like scum of the Earth\nI've got goons to feed and babies to birth\nI'm the God now, plus I'm a super rich nigga\nDo more help than harm, either way you figure\nShould I protect and serve or cock and aim destruction?\nLet the enterprise take over the force of production\nCorruption, my mind state is unpredictable\nI'm bulletproof now, back from the dead, I'm invincible", "image":

kill, I play to win\nStay catching up with the cutthroats\nSome men shoot a nigga, throw 'em off the tugboat, no floats\nThe body sinks to the bottom\nOr left off the side of the road to smell rotten\nThe murder sprees, random killings\nGhostface Killah's back attacking villains, hanging from the ceilings\nGodfather motives, gangsta mentality\nBlack superhero with the immortality\nForever, I be creeping in a black mist\nIll night vision with the militant tactics\nI glide through the air like a swarm of bees\nShake niggas off quick like a dog with fleas\nRaw meat, leave bodies slumped in the street\nRevenge is the spice of life, it's so sweet\nAy yo, pipe bombs blowing they souls to Jesus\nDon't need nothing but the puzzle glue for the pieces\nMeat cleaver cut finger tips like rib tips\nHome invasions, cars gonna flip, DeLucas lose\nPair of cement shoes, tossed in the ocean\nPopped until they brain ooze, I won't lose\nBlood all on my apron, hog tie 'em up while they try escaping\nPeeped the visual, tied 'em up individual\nTook their clothes off, season 'em like sausage\nLet the pits out to eat 'em, that's the remedy\nAttack, kill, bite off their extremities\nBlood bath splash my name on my wall\nCall it piece delivery, leave a tip on the stall\nWith an arm, leg, a head, I'm coming for you all\n\n\nUh-huh, it's the sure shot, yo, yeah\n\nHeart of a lion, king of the jungle\nI'm a humble killer bee, you as soft as a bumble\nI don't crumble, I strike back hard with a vengeance\nAttack through these killer words I spit in a sentence\nI'm a menace, the black Clark Kent, caped crusader\nThe face of a ghost, I disappear in the vapors\nYou could murder my flesh and bone, soul's invincible\nRevenge my death, payback's the main principal\nProtect ya neck when you move, I be lurking in the shadows\nStarks, the gangsta nigga, I never lose battles\nPimp bitches with a superhero logo on my chest\nBig Gucci link, GFK on the crest\nIcy arm for the eagle with the eight carat ruby eyes\nPiss on your motherfucking lawn while I'm stupid high\nAll black down, royalty purple and some ice chips\nTwo Glock 9's pointed at you in a hype flick\n\nNow I'm alone in the room, and I just stare at the wall\nRevenge my death but I'm going through withdrawals\nMy lost niggas, I miss them this new power and wisdom\nGot me thinking I've made a whole lot of bad decisions\nGot Logan still to deal with, should I kill her?\nThrow her fuckin' ass in a cage with a gorilla\nOr let her live and treat her like scum of the Earth\nI've got goons to feed and babies to birth\nI'm the God now, plus I'm a super rich nigga\nDo more help than harm, either way you figure\nShould I protect and serve or cock and aim destruction?\nLet the enterprise take over the force of production\nCorruption, my mind state is unpredictable\nI'm bulletproof now, back from the dead, I'm invincible"}}, {"title": "The Watch", "album": "Hidden Darts: Special Edition", "year":

as\nCalm as possible, make the deal go through\nIf not, here's 12 shots, we know how you do\nPlease make yo' killings clean, slugs up in between\nThey eyes, like \"True Lies,\" kill 'em and flee the scene\nJust bring back the coke or the cream\nOr else, your life is on the shelf, we mean this Frank\nThem cats we fuckin with put bombs in your mom's gas tank\nLet's get this money baby, they shady, we get shady\nDress up like ladies and burn 'em with dirty 380's\nThen they come to kill our babies, that's all out\nI got gats that blow the wall out, clear them all out\nFuck the fallout, word to Stretch, I bet they pussy\nThe seven digits push me, fuckin real, here's the deal\nI got a hundred bricks, fourteen-five apiece (uh-huh)\nEnough to cop a six; buy the house on the beach (uh-huh)\nSupply the peeps with Jeeps, brick apiece, capiche?\nEverybody gettin cream no one considered them leech\nThink about it now that's damn near one-point-five\nI kill 'em all I'll be set for life\nFrank pay attention\nThese motherfuckers is henchmen, renegades\nIf you die they still get paid, extra probably\nFuck a robbery, I'm the boss\nPromise you won't rob 'em\nI promise\nBut of course you know I had my fingers crossed\n\nNiggas got to die, if I go they got to go\nNiggas got to die, let a hundred shots float\nNiggas got to die, cause it's all up in the scrolls\nCatch a body on the bridge, three bricks, live kid\n... if I go they got to go\nNiggas got to die, let a hundred shots float\nNiggas got to die, cause it's all up in the scrolls\nCatch a body on the bridge, three bricks, live kid\n\nWe up in the lab, two Spanish, one Arab lady\nLayin on the bed, lookin like a drag\nHad the pillow cuffed, lookin at me and Frank, her grill was rough\nWho woulda ever think she'd rather do us up\nBut that's the business, back to the sitch\nOn these Puerto Rican kids with pistols\nDoin sign language is twitchin noses\nAsk 'em where the money at, yo where the coke at papi?\nWe can do this all day, yo y'all both whack\nThey pulled out, one of my dunn soldiers was wombed out\nThey snuck up on him, put the tool up in his mouth\nWalked them up in crib, big move, but they grabbed the kid\nHad the shotty on my beehive, my wig\nAnd yo they took me to the bathroom, started up the chainsaw yo\nYou gon' talk or see your brains on the floor\nThat's when 6 to 7 masked men, came in blastin yo\nAll I heard was Frank, \"Lexi get the raw!\n\n\nBleed just like us, believe my pipe bust\nIf he holdin the right amount of cheese I might rush the spot\nUp early in the mornin, kick the door in, wave the 4 an'\n(fuck) the brawlin, cause Tony for the stallin\nAnd all I see is dollar signs, here's the bottom line either\nGive up the product or get shot up with a brolic 9\nInvest figures to address (niggas)\nWorkin out, all I curl is my index finger\nGot a safe that hold more notes than Cortex singers\nMy work is move trays, serve 'em up like gourmet dinners\nWhen it comes to cuttin that (coke), who got the best trimmers\nEdward Scissorhands them grams, (niggas) respect winners\nI got them big spenders comin through, hourly\nCompetition, we knock 'em out the box, powerfully\nStill drop a ill verse, on the D.I., me\nYou might be gone, but the legacy is B.I.G., nigga\nUh-huh\n\nYo I think they tryin to do somethin man\nI don't know what it is but we gon' go in there handle this business man\nStraight up, y'knahmean?\nIt's goin down...\nLet's go handle this man..."}}, {"title": "Toney Sigel A.K.A.

swatches and carry a couple oxes\nKeep a deuce deuce by his ankle and get it poppin'\nYou know, we be the boys clockin' the graveyard shift\nBig bubbles, countin' the cream, burnin' the lazar spliff\nMy man jumps out the whip with the AR 5th\nAnd we ball from plenties of parties, 'cause we start shit\nParole holes, six months in the box\nMy little sister got her head shaved off\nShe made it home from shock\nWe sellin cartons, Pampers, Similac formula\nAnything you take because the paper keep callin ya\nGangsters keep ballin fosho, we want more\nWe make it rain from the tech and the wop\nThe next coroner priests don't have enough cups for us\nTo slow us up, they hit us with dusk\nThen they rush-bust, my man Big Ron will break the cuffs\n300 pound nigga, po-po has to fuck him up\nThey say that my projects should undergo therapy\nWe never voted, we votin' for Oprah, Obama, and Eric B\n\nGuns imported from Duval\nWheelchairs and shit bags\nPeach Snapples and pretty scalpels, renaissance\nI'll stick a pick in ya gut at the chapel\nI'll blow a nigga for a box of Huggies\nCop-killers with a box of dummies\nDummies, stuck to the project floors\nNiggas is suited up and we ready for war\n\nIt's the Broad Street Bully and the Killah with no Face\nMy mac bullets burn like tequila with no chase, yeah!\nMy knife work like the guillotine sword, cutting niggas\nStop frontin' for my killa bee swarm, something\nEmpty out the whole clip and reload\nShotgun barrel leave it smoking like a broke stove\nYeah, and I'm all about that bullshit\nThe casket, the hearse, and the pastor in the pulpit\nI kill a nigga at the drop of a dime\nJust imagine what I'd do for a quarter\nAin't no tellin what I'd do for a dollar\nPop a nigga right in front of his mama\nSon a nigga right in front of his daughter\nAnd I'm nothing like your father\nYou couldn't come from these nuts I got\nAnd C. Baltimore sucked this cock\nI know most of y'all wouldn't understand\nGet it? Understand?\nYeah some niggas will and some niggas won't\nLike some niggas kill and some niggas don't (uh-uh)\nYou's a fake-it-'til-you-make-it of nigga\nI'm a straight-up-take-it type of nigga\nPistol-whip-a-nigga-'til-I-break-it type of nigga\nI'm hard on chumps, most of these dudes is fags\nPut the guarder on pumps, push the broom up they ass\nOr the knife like American me, American Sig' is Muslim\nSo I ain't feelin Bush overseas\nI think with the wisdom of Malcolm, got the soul of a Panther\nSo by any means is the anthem\nYou gonna have to cut me out the track like cancer\nI

precision\nSealing bags in the kitchen\nSlinging crack to these pigeons\nFor the fact that I'm driven\nMy linebackers is missing\nSend you back and good rides\nTrapped in this mission where snakes and rats is forbidden\nKeep my gun hidden niggas is bitches signing petitions\nAnd they providing convictions\nSee I survive through the system under the livest conditions\nMy riders ride on a mission for snitching\nYou get your back blown right out of commission\nYou'll be missing like them crazy Christians and swimming with all the fishes\nYour misses will come and visit your body with hugs and kisses\nNow tell me is that nutritious we party with chips and liquors\nYour wisses is coming with us for real kid they bought me presents\nThe difference is this is business big biscuits big figures\nWe click on religious niggas for acting too superstitious\nMove cause the group is viscous\nShoot if you want your wishes to blow\nSee trife in the Bentley with a group of bitches\nMy design is already made\nSo young an so strong\nAnd just waiting to be saved\nMy life's no longer in the hands of district attorneys or envious niggas\nWho thirsty cause I'm OT with prince with thirty moving like magic\nBut niggas ain't worthy like Michael cooper when I shoot I aim sturdy\nMother maiden mother fuck em\nRhymes so dope I hope I make it through customs\nWe can take it to the streets like a game at the rucker\nThey claim they love us but all that changes\nWhen you on and they fucked up dog ain't no flaws in a hustla\nI ain't no longer in state greens and chuckers\nWaiting for the beach port and the breaks streets oughta relate\nI see it all in your face the window to your soul ain't tinted\nYou want to see me falling from grace\nNo way nigga I'm stretching my weight like cocaine dealers\nWhat they gonna say now the flow way iller\nIf dough change things I'm no longer the same\nBut what I became does not conflict with from where I cam\nI was dealing with caine like cold chilla back when lyricist rained\nAnd dope was killing em, any MC who think they ill as me\nOr real as me should chill I mean that's your opinion\nBut my raps is relentless like a mac with an infra\nAnd I'm back with a vengeance, like Sprewell smashing the Knicks\nAfter they shipped him despite the fans resistance\nBig and 'Pac is up top so the nicest man living is right here\nIts quite clear like

pigeons\nFor the fact that I'm driven\nMy linebackers is missing\nSend you back and good rides\nTrapped in this mission where snakes and rats is forbidden\nKeep my gun hidden niggas is bitches signing petitions\nAnd they providing convictions\nSee I survive through the system under the livest conditions\nMy riders ride on a mission for snitching\nYou get your back blown right out of commission\nYou'll be missing like them crazy Christians and swimming with all the fishes\nYour misses will come and visit your body with hugs and kisses\nNow tell me is that nutritious we party with chips and liquors\nYour wisses is coming with us for real kid they bought me presents\nThe difference is this is business big biscuits big figures\nWe click on religious niggas for acting too superstitious\nMove cause the group is viscous\nShoot if you want your wishes to blow\nSee trife in the Bentley with a group of bitches\nMy design is already made\nSo young an so strong\nAnd just waiting to be saved\nMy life's no longer in the hands of district attorneys or envious niggas\nWho thirsty cause I'm OT with prince with thirty moving like magic\nBut niggas ain't worthy like Michael cooper when I shoot I aim sturdy\nMother maiden mother fuck em\nRhymes so dope I hope I make it through customs\nWe can take it to the streets like a game at the rucker\nThey claim they love us but all that changes\nWhen you on and they fucked up dog ain't no flaws in a hustla\nI ain't no longer in state greens and chuckers\nWaiting for the beach port and the breaks streets oughta relate\nI see it all in your face the window to your soul ain't tinted\nYou want to see me falling from grace\nNo way nigga I'm stretching my weight like cocaine dealers\nWhat they gonna say now the flow way iller\nIf dough change things I'm no longer the same\nBut what I became does not conflict with from where I cam\nI was dealing with caine like cold chilla back when lyricist rained\nAnd dope was killing em, any MC who think they ill as me\nOr real as me should chill I mean that's your opinion\nBut my raps is relentless like a mac with an infra\nAnd I'm back with a vengeance, like Sprewell smashing the Knicks\nAfter they shipped him despite the fans resistance\nBig and 'Pac is up top so the nicest man living is right here\nIts quite clear like diamonds that glisten"}}, {"title": "Tony's

funny\nShrimp's every night, ordering steaks\nThem jumbo joints, them shits cost a buck 50 for eight\nAnd when you told me your Merlot, need more grapes\nI said \"Honey, you never had wine before!\"\nAnd if you did, that's not how you act at all\nAnd no... that's not how we rock in Theodore\n\nPlease, babe, I love you\n(Take me back, I'll never do it again)\nAlways want you\n(You know

time\nYou know you need me in the streets, to help you run things\nAnd if you catch a case, you got it wrong, I'mma pawn rings\nI'm your lady boo, that's what I'm suppose to do\nI know when you was coppin' my Coupe, that you was coppin' two\nI know when you got me the red one, that she got the blue\nBut the way I chew on you, you should of got me two\nNow you got me in the kitchen, with your fryin' on\nTell me that you gon' move with me, I know you lyin', dog\nWho loves you baby? Nobody like Jacki-O\nCook, clean, break up your weed, and I give you nasty throat\nWhat you actin' for? Get back in the door\nCome on, home, where you belong, let's get it on\n\n\nYo, you know I always love you, I never meant to hurt you\nEven the stress'll work you, I miss your old perfume\nPromise never curse you, I want you in my circle\nHoney right by my side where I keep my herbals\nWe both agree on no more fighting, we'll just have a verbal\nThe man'll treat you like a queen, I will bird you\nMother and father birthed you, if I have to hit you\nThen damn, I might as well leave, cuz I don't deserve you\nWatch from you face, when you sleep, let the heat disturb you\nFiendin' from the magic wand, when she 'nique and serve you\nTake me please, take me with ease\nTake me back, God damn, and scrape marks on my knees\n'Member the first time you made my key\nYou was drunk, you went behind a tree and pee'd\nI miss shit like that, and all of the times\nWe played cops, I'll arrest you in bed\nPolice brutality, I'll leave the side of your ass red\nGod damn it, is sex for real girl?

bullshit you put me through a couple months back\nThat wasn't right, call the cops on me, and told them I had it like\n\"Yeah, pop the trunk, he got dope and guns\"\nCheck for warrants, that son of a bitch on the run, I know\nThree of his niggas got life, he use to roll with\nAnd told 'em I bodied an upcoming basketball star\nOnce I heard that, I fell out the cop car, real hard\nYou bugged out, and thugged out, wanted me to take you back\nThat could never happen, I'm sorry\nNo disrespect, but you a psycho, honey\nGot that S.S.I. money, and you start actin' funny\nShrimp's every night, ordering steaks\nThem jumbo joints, them shits cost a buck 50 for eight\nAnd when you told me your Merlot, need more grapes\nI said \"Honey, you never had wine before!\"\nAnd if you did, that's not how you act at all\nAnd no... that's not how we rock in Theodore\n\nPlease, babe, I love you\n(Take me back, I'll never do it again)\nAlways want you\n(You know that you my lover and my best friend)\nYes, darling, it's true\n(Come on, home, where you belong, let's get it on)\nPlease, babe, I want you....\n\nBack to them days, when the yay' was bein' frontin' to you\nHundred thousand dollar shopping sprees wasn't nothin' to you\nWhen three was a crowd... but I dealt with it\nAnd your sex wasn't wild.... but I dealt with it\nI always felt shitted, you should of take me back\nThe girl that introduced you to boy, and helped you open your stacks\nI got you in South connects, for the hard grind\nThat's why I took mine off the top, for the hard time\nYou know you need me in the streets, to help you run things\nAnd if you catch a case, you got it wrong, I'mma pawn rings\nI'm your lady boo, that's what I'm suppose to do\nI know when you was coppin' my Coupe, that you was coppin' two\nI know when you got me the red one, that she got the blue\nBut the way I chew on you, you should of got me two\nNow you got me in the kitchen, with your fryin' on\nTell me that you gon' move with me, I know you lyin', dog\nWho loves you baby? Nobody like Jacki-O\nCook, clean, break up your weed, and I give you nasty throat\nWhat you actin' for? Get back in the door\nCome on, home, where you belong, let's get it on\n\n\nYo, you know I always love you, I never meant to hurt you\nEven the stress'll work you, I miss your old perfume\nPromise never curse you, I want you in my circle\nHoney right by my side where I keep my herbals\nWe both agree on no more fighting, we'll just have a verbal\nThe man'll treat you like a queen, I will bird you\nMother and father birthed you, if I have to hit you\nThen damn, I might as well leave, cuz I don't deserve you\nWatch from you face, when you sleep, let the heat disturb you\nFiendin' from the magic wand, when she 'nique and serve you\nTake me please, take me with ease\nTake me back, God damn, and scrape marks on my knees\n'Member the first time you made my key\nYou was drunk, you went behind a tree and pee'd\nI miss shit like that, and all of the times\nWe played cops, I'll arrest you in bed\nPolice brutality, I'll leave the side of your ass red\nGod damn it, is sex for real girl? Girl, we in special ed\nUh-huh... fuck that, take me back, pretty please, with you on top\n\n\nYeah, yo this goes for everybody all across the world\nWhether you got fired or your lover dropped you and all that\nYouknowhatimsayin? Everybody wanna get tooken back\nYouknowhatimean? Don't be afraid to ask, if you wanna see--\nYo, take me back, fuck it, everybody wanna get tooken back and shit\nThis is your man, Big Ghost, your host, signing off and shit\nTheodore, I understand"}}, {"title": "Troublemakers", "album": "Apollo Kids", "year": "2010-12-21", "lyrics": "Forreal?

lullabies\nGangsta ever readies, take off my shirt, no batteries, nigga\nJust one mean magnum killer\nSnowmobiles jetting out the Timber, feel Chef altitude\nYo, I can't breathe, check the splendor\nBrazilian honey dip, I'm on my rifle day, nigga\nTimes is roughing, Timberland cuffing\nOne knee up, G up all the re-up\nHope we can pull it back, my throat my only weapon, blow the beat up\n\nStuff Brillo pads in the rat holes, reduce that faggot ass nigga\nWho wanna jump like a frog to a tadpole\nGag it up, sliding through the ER, batted up\nA tube in your dick, you can't piss when standing up\nHands is shaking, doctors is taken to operating\n\"Nah, he might not live!\" So they start debating\nYou in bad shape, in the neck of New York\nYour slithering ways, lay with you a bad snake\nSmash bake, eight stab holes in your shoulder blades\nYou wilding on the stretcher and shit, they trynna hold your legs\nNah don't hold his legs, tell that bitch ass nigga to chill\nPut something in his meat like bolognese\nGot gophers that sleep in the woods, Carhartt down\nPadlock your bow-legged spot, where your rocks now?\nYou ain't moving no crack, you'se a moving ass rat\nAfter you lay up in that morgue, I'mma fuck your back\nYeah, nigga, die slow with your smirk on\nNight-night lights, dim it down, get your mirk on\nLater I see you in hell, get your burn on\nFilled with embalming fluid, get your sherm on\n\nMy sherm on in the hood when I ride by\nMy eyes looking like I learned how to skydive\nThe world is yours, there's rules you abide by\nRide with the fly guy on I-95\nThey said a nigga return, but I never left\nI told Big L through me, he could resurrect\nI'm that nigga like Puff in L-O-X\nI took one L and life is still Double X\nBrick City where I breathe all the trees at\nThe E's in M&M's, I need a Relapse\nAnd bitches, grab my mic, give me feedback\nReggie you an asshole, baby I be that\nYeah, I get cocky when the beat pumping\nYou know you doing it when your tire lip running\nI keep a freak and I call her chicken McNugget\nCuz this Superbad nigga, she McLovin'\n\nFiends get killed in my hallways, we parlay\nMy feet been killing me all day\nYour boy down for lot, like them killas in RahWay\nIt's all work and no play, cuz this block ain't nothing like Broadway\nRevenge is sweeter than sorbet, you all become believers\nOnce this heaters in your face, just a part of my feng shui\nYa'll don't want no part of the gun spray\nI would hate to pull it and one stray\nThat's where the innocents by stand, we trapped inside these tenements like damn\nWhy mama trynna feed us this spiced ham\nConnects trynna cheat us with light grams\nCo-defendants try to lighten they sentence, snitching to white man\nTurned state evidence, fam, we ain't

Can I get a juice, lord?\nYeah, yeah... yeah, squad niggas boy, forreal\nUh-huh, forreal, man, word, open the door, man\nHustle flow shit, yeah, aiyo, pass the cigar, lord\nCome on, man, stop playing, man\n\nWe in the cabin playing backgammon, gorilla monster slammers\nBrothers hire us, try us you gon' die, son\nGreen medicine, blow veterans\nRun in Adidas store, six more velours, drawers feather skin\nHaircutted up, hollering, seven through three sixes\nNo, we ain't the devil, where ya llama, dick?\nCan't stand the other side, niggas know we rich, we color guys\nLoose up your mother, true lullabies\nGangsta ever readies, take off my shirt, no batteries, nigga\nJust one mean magnum killer\nSnowmobiles jetting out the Timber, feel Chef altitude\nYo, I can't breathe, check the splendor\nBrazilian honey dip, I'm on my rifle day, nigga\nTimes is roughing, Timberland cuffing\nOne knee up, G up all the re-up\nHope we can pull it back, my throat my only weapon, blow the beat up\n\nStuff Brillo pads in the rat holes, reduce that faggot ass nigga\nWho wanna jump like a frog to a tadpole\nGag it up, sliding through the ER, batted up\nA tube in your dick, you can't piss when standing up\nHands is shaking, doctors is taken to operating\n\"Nah, he might not live!\" So they start debating\nYou in bad shape, in the neck of New York\nYour slithering ways, lay with you a bad snake\nSmash bake, eight stab holes in your shoulder blades\nYou wilding on the stretcher and shit, they trynna hold your legs\nNah don't hold his legs, tell that bitch ass nigga to chill\nPut something in his meat like bolognese\nGot gophers that sleep in the woods, Carhartt down\nPadlock your bow-legged spot, where your rocks now?\nYou ain't moving no crack, you'se a moving ass rat\nAfter you lay up in that morgue, I'mma fuck your back\nYeah, nigga, die slow with your smirk on\nNight-night lights, dim it down, get your mirk on\nLater I see you in hell, get your burn on\nFilled with embalming fluid, get your sherm on\n\nMy sherm on in the hood when I ride by\nMy eyes looking like I learned how to skydive\nThe world is yours, there's rules you abide by\nRide with the fly guy on I-95\nThey said a nigga return, but I never left\nI told Big L through me, he could resurrect\nI'm that nigga like Puff in L-O-X\nI took one L and life is still Double X\nBrick City where I breathe all the trees at\nThe E's in M&M's, I need a Relapse\nAnd bitches, grab my mic, give me feedback\nReggie you an asshole, baby I be that\nYeah, I get cocky when the beat pumping\nYou know you doing it when your tire lip running\nI keep a freak and I call her chicken McNugget\nCuz this Superbad nigga, she McLovin'\n\nFiends get killed in my hallways, we parlay\nMy feet been killing me all day\nYour boy down for lot, like them killas in RahWay\nIt's all work and no play, cuz this block ain't nothing like Broadway\nRevenge is sweeter than sorbet, you all become believers\nOnce this heaters in your face, just a part of my feng shui\nYa'll don't want no part of the gun spray\nI would hate to pull it and one stray\nThat's where the innocents by stand, we trapped inside these tenements like damn\nWhy mama trynna feed us this spiced ham\nConnects trynna cheat us with light grams\nCo-defendants try to lighten they sentence, snitching to white man\nTurned state evidence, fam, we ain't jellin'\nFelons ain't felons no more, they straight tellin'\nAin't nothing worse than a rat, you can't smellin'\nAnd ain't nothing worse than a trap you can't sell in"}}, {"title": "Underwater",

when I arrived, I opened the door\nNo I knocked first, I'm not on my turf\nI seen a ray of lights that resemble live fireworks\nSome mermaids with Halle Berry haircuts flashing\nThey tail like follow me now, don't be afraid\nI'mma show you where all the djinns and spirits pray\nIf you scared to face this life you shouldn't stay\nSo I kept on swimming, grabbed on to her fin to help me out\nAs we got close I seen the boat all shot up with his anchor out\nThen she asked me politely what I'm thinking about, I said nothing\nShe said nothing leaves nothing\nIf you feel me I bet this'll bring that out\nI seen rubies, diamonds, smothered under octopus\nJellyfish sharks soar, aquaproof pocketbook\nPearls on the mermaid girls\nGucci belts that they rock for no reason from a different world\nUp ahead lies Noah's Ark, but that's waves away\nAnd way to the right, that's one of our bangin spas\nShe quoted I took notice, Spongebob in the Bentley Coupe\nBangin the Isleys, he slow backed up\nThen he passed me swoop, seen his chick eyein me hard\nHe got vexed and smacked his boo\nTook off, continued my travels\nSeen a rock from the Titanic, looking fat and nah it wasn't damaged\nThen I seen somethin real big\nSky blue and gold with whitewalls, behind a large city\nThat was lost before Christ walked the walk\nUpon the waters that's so bright\nEverytime we got close the mermaid held on tight\nAll I heard was \"Allahu Akbar, Allahu Akbar\"\n\"Bismillah ar-Rahman, ar-Raheem, Allah screamed\"\nThat we heard from afar, everyone selat\nIn the world's banginest mosque got crowded in\nWith life that I can't explain\nThey said sir yes I'm glad you came, greeted me with Qu'rans and Torahs\nPrayed after that we said amen", "image":

took control when I arrived, I opened the door\nNo I knocked first, I'm not on my turf\nI seen a ray of lights that resemble live fireworks\nSome mermaids with Halle Berry haircuts flashing\nThey tail like follow me now, don't be afraid\nI'mma show you where all the djinns and spirits pray\nIf you scared to face this life you shouldn't stay\nSo I kept on swimming, grabbed on to her fin to help me out\nAs we got close I seen the boat all shot up with his anchor out\nThen she asked me politely what I'm thinking about, I said nothing\nShe said nothing leaves nothing\nIf you feel me I bet this'll bring that out\nI seen rubies, diamonds, smothered under octopus\nJellyfish sharks soar, aquaproof pocketbook\nPearls on the mermaid girls\nGucci belts that they rock for no reason from a different world\nUp ahead lies Noah's Ark, but that's waves away\nAnd way to the right, that's one of our bangin spas\nShe quoted I took notice, Spongebob in the Bentley Coupe\nBangin the Isleys, he slow backed up\nThen he passed me swoop, seen his chick eyein me hard\nHe got vexed and smacked his boo\nTook off, continued my travels\nSeen a rock from the Titanic, looking fat and nah it wasn't damaged\nThen I seen somethin real big\nSky blue and gold with whitewalls, behind a large city\nThat was lost before Christ walked the walk\nUpon the waters that's so bright\nEverytime we got close the mermaid held on tight\nAll I heard was \"Allahu Akbar, Allahu Akbar\"\n\"Bismillah ar-Rahman, ar-Raheem, Allah screamed\"\nThat we heard from afar, everyone selat\nIn the world's banginest mosque got crowded in\nWith life that I can't explain\nThey said sir yes I'm glad you came, greeted me with Qu'rans and Torahs\nPrayed after that we said amen"}}, {"title": "Walk Around", "album": "The Big Doe Rehab",

celebrate New York, around the world\nAnd yo, Ghostface, go in heavy, man, let's do it!\n\n(I just want to celebrate)\nLike my squad won the Super Bowl\n(I just want to celebrate)\nLike we bangin' on New Years Eve, y'all\n(I just want to celebrate)\nLike we just beat trial\n(I just want to celebrate)\nWe hype for just being here\n\nStones on every arm, the crib is ten million\nThe corks from Dom Perignon can't reach my ceiling\nFour maids with four grenades\nWhen the sun's in my face, all I do is lower the walls for shade\nThe pool's a pain in the ass, 50 grand on Windex, kid\nThey keep it clean, the whole bottom is glass\nSo you can see the sharks and piranhas, a pair of pajamas\nThat's my neighbor, the faggot disresepecting my mama\nNo cars in the garage, it's underground shit\nThey way the floor open up you think I'm hiding spaceships\nFrench chefs, the best grapes on they breath\nLouie aprons on the Yank cats, the puffy cooks the rest\nBesides, I got birds that never leave the nest\nThey fuck with me, I'll watch 'em confess, then I'll go rest\nGet back up, deposit them checks\nMuthafuckas fuckin' up a good time by snappin' your necks\n\n(I just want to celebrate)\nLike my baby's first steps, you heard?\n(I just want to celebrate)\nLike my first time platinum, y'all\n(I just want to celebrate)\nLike my first piece of nookie, uhh\n(I just want to celebrate)\nWe hype for just being here\n\nMoney for everybody, candy to the kids\nCatch me on dateline, Starky too big\nI'm like a mannequin; I stay jig\nMansion parties for all star weekend in my L.A. crib\nWe came to party, run out of Goose we got Dollies\nShorty's sweatin' me, check out her body\nThrow up your hands like it's your birthday, mami\nLet's celebrate, now I got her girlfriends behind me\nNow I'm in the middle, watch is all chiseled\nI can holla at the birds, like Dr. Dolittle\n(What's that in your pocket, Ghost?) A Dill pickle\n(Not that) Oh, that's the .45 stainless nickel\nI'm pullin' a green, got a G for the biggest ass on the floor who look right in them jeans\nIf you fat, I might take one for the team\nBut I gotta get drunk first, know what I mean? Come on!\n\n(I just want to celebrate)\nLike we won the Power Ball money\n(I just want to celebrate)\nTony Starks won an Oscar, y'all\n(I just want to celebrate)\nLike all of my goons just came home\n(I just want to celebrate)\nWe 'bout to have a good year\n\nNa-na-na-na-nah, you can't catch me\nI'm out like Thomas in a five-fifty\nPolice be fiending to frisk me\nI'm so legit I walk away with the car keys pissy\nBack at the labo, shorty wop need a Dutch\nHe fuckin' wit a Goose dick, tonight I'ma beat it up\nYour thing to wet, you sure you ain't seeded up?\n(That's how I get, Ghost, especially when you eat it up)\nMy goodness gracious, ass is flirtatious\nMove it around like a snake miss or sexy waitress\nGhost don't have no patience\nI like you, I usually change chicks like radio stations\nI'm definitely not looking for love\nBut if you give it to me right now I might say I was\nYou can chill if you want, I got crazy bud\nBut before we do, what it do, go jump in the tub; come on!\n\n(I just want to celebrate)\nThrow your hands up, nigga\n(I just want to celebrate)\nPop the 'pagne, pop the cork\n(I just want to celebrate)\nRepresentin' on the streets of New York\n(I just want to celebrate)\n{Ghostface} We 'bout to have a good year\n\nYeah, we gets it in, gets it in, gets it in\nNew York, we been had it, we gets it in\nOutta town we fuckin' up but gets it in\nWorldwide we doin', we gets it in\nThe Ghostface, Kid Capri, I gets it in\nThat's no joke, when we here, we get it in\nNo kiddin', in the building\nGetting it in, all day, getting it in..."}}, {"title": "We Made It", "album": "Supreme Clientele", "year": "2000-02-08", "lyrics": "Tony Starks fights again for survival\nAnd by just a thin thread of electric current\nWins another victory\n\nUgh, c'mon, yeah, c'mon y'all\n(Bounce wit us) Hip-hop\n(What?

He a vet\nPlus the best, now tell me how we gon' fail\nWhen we dealing with 'Supreme Clientele\n\nFrom Rikers Island to the Cayman Island\nWe thugs like, life is the same challenge\nDo the knowledge,

talent\nAnd if you live the streets, you better stay silent\n\nYo, spotted at The Mirage, Ghostface swarmed by groupies\nMingle among stars, I come in cat, invades Mars\nHighlight of the century, first bet placed upon entry\nFainted when the book mentioned me\nKeep balling, new systems, high sciences\nDrop that, Ghost listening, track sizzling\nAngelica, Judy Plum for bitches, Goines king of the century\nBest sellers for niggas, stay together\nPosted up trucks, leaning on the Benz cinemax smile\nShot in thirty-five lens you program\nBroke bottles of Dom, seven inch bangles, back breakers\nI'm a dope fiend, look at my arm, Popeye strength\nRap with a British accent, Gucci clothes\nDennis Coles in the latest fashions blow backs in\nFlip raps like forty-eight bundles\nDinner plates, deadly front gates, celeb Bryant Gumbel\n\nAnalyze This shit like De Niro\nWords in your center ear hole\nBlocks of ice like Sub-Zero, we been right since day zero\nShatter your soul like glass windows\nTurn virgins to nymphos, pop these hollows\nAt fake cats in a Tahoe\nWild out, throw your liquor bottles\nAt hood rats to the richest models\nWe conversate like Christ and the Twelve Apostles\nAnd life without you, held counsel with great men\nTo murderers in the state pen\nBeing caged in the wages of sin\nBefore they read up they pop our tape in\nYou ain't gotta tuck you chain in\nCause here we want the head of Satan\nDoo-rags and our pants hanging\n*Chip Banks starts to sing \"we made it\" again*\n\nUh-huh, uh-huh that's right y'all\nStreet corners, jail niggas\nRiker's

curse back\nI got it from the older folks sittin in the living room\nEverybody had cups stylistic song boom\nBut then came Darryl Mack lightin' all the reefer up\nBaby caught a contact I'm trying to tie my sneaker up\nI'm missing all the loops strings going in the wrong holes\nIt feels like I'm wobbling, look at all these afros\nSoon as I thought I was good the joke's on me\nI heard a voice \"get in the room,\" I get angry\nStomp my feet, catch a tantrum\nSpit, scream, fuck that\nMomma shake me real hard, then get the big gat\nThat's called the belt help me as I yelled\nI'm in the room like (panting)\"huh, huh, huh\" with mad welps\nRagged out, bad belt yes her presence was felt\nThen get my black ass in the bed it's time crash out (crash out)\n\n\"Take me across her lap\nShe used to whip me with a strap\nWhen I was bad\"\n\"\u2014bad\"\n\"Take me across her lap\nShe used to whip me with a strap\nWhen I was bad\"\n\"\u2014bad\"\n\nDespite the alcohol, I had a great old Mama\nShe famous for her slaps and to this day she's honored\nBut when I was a lil dude her son was a lil rude\nI picked the peas off my plate and pour juice in a nigga food\nGet beat, then I'd run and tell grandman \"mama hit me for no reason\"\nShe whipped me hard when I finished eatin\nAnd felt that belt stingin after I wet that bed\nHid my drawers and start cryin, when she felt that bed\nCaught another when I told her those the fake pro-keds\nIn the corner weavin and screamin trying to block my head (ahHH!)\nNowadays kids don't get beat, they get big treats\nFresh pair of sneaks, punishments like have a seat\nBack then when friends and neighbors would bust that ass\nAnd bring you back to your momma she got the switch in the stash\nThat's back to back beatings\nOnly went outside for free lunch with welts on my legs still leakin yo\n\n\"Take me across her lap\nShe used to whip me with a strap\nWhen I was bad\"\n\"\u2014bad\"\n\"Take me across her lap\nShe used to whip me with a

to whip me with a strap\nWhen I was bad\"\n\"\u2014bad\"\n\nPicture me snotty nose sittin on my aunt's lap\nThe kid like 5 or 6 shit I will curse back\nI got it from the older folks sittin in the living room\nEverybody had cups stylistic song boom\nBut then came Darryl Mack lightin' all the reefer up\nBaby caught a contact I'm trying to tie my sneaker up\nI'm missing all the loops strings going in the wrong holes\nIt feels like I'm wobbling, look at all these afros\nSoon as I thought I was good the joke's on me\nI heard a voice \"get in the room,\" I get angry\nStomp my feet, catch a tantrum\nSpit, scream, fuck that\nMomma shake me real hard, then get the big gat\nThat's called the belt help me as I yelled\nI'm in the room like (panting)\"huh, huh, huh\" with mad welps\nRagged out, bad belt yes her presence was felt\nThen get my black ass in the bed it's time crash out (crash out)\n\n\"Take me across her lap\nShe used to whip me with a strap\nWhen I was bad\"\n\"\u2014bad\"\n\"Take me across her lap\nShe used to whip me with a strap\nWhen I was bad\"\n\"\u2014bad\"\n\nDespite the alcohol, I had a great old Mama\nShe famous for her slaps and to this day she's honored\nBut when I was a lil dude her son was a lil rude\nI picked the peas off my plate and pour juice in a nigga food\nGet beat, then I'd run and tell grandman \"mama hit me for no reason\"\nShe whipped me hard when I finished eatin\nAnd felt that belt stingin after I wet that bed\nHid my drawers and start cryin, when she felt that bed\nCaught another when I told her those the fake pro-keds\nIn the corner weavin and screamin trying to block my head (ahHH!)\nNowadays kids don't get beat, they get big treats\nFresh pair of sneaks, punishments like have a seat\nBack then when friends and neighbors would bust that ass\nAnd bring you back to your momma she got the switch in the stash\nThat's back to back beatings\nOnly went outside for free lunch with welts on my legs still leakin yo\n\n\"Take me across her lap\nShe used to whip me with a strap\nWhen I was bad\"\n\"\u2014bad\"\n\"Take me across her lap\nShe used to whip me with a strap\nWhen I was bad\"\n\"\u2014bad\""}}, {"title": "White Linen Affair (Toney Awards)", "album": "The Big Doe Rehab", "year": "2007-12-04", "lyrics": "{*skit plays for first minute or so of

and glass bracelets\nAvian water's ya choice, put ice\nI'm missing a g-note, fixed price\nBut the only thing fixed, is the holes that we put in the dice\nRocks is okay, my voice is extraordinaire\nThe man that scrapped with lions, hiberated with polar bears\nHope I don't play with baking soda in my older years\nMantles'll sit up like hill, I'd have to fold my beard\nCheck one, two, Sonny, tell Bob to dim the lights up\nYou see the studs, I want the red strobe to hit it right\nStones are screaming, hot lattes, the rosees\nMy robes is a murder statement, you fucking with rode rage\nLadies and gentlemen, boys and girls\nChildren of all ages, I pack metal like braces\nSnap of the fingers, bitches fighting over my paper\nY'all need to chill, sit the fuck down and fix ya makeup\nGhost is ya host, so allow me, hand me ya coats\nBentley Farnsworth, will check them proudly\nWe got D-Block, Wu-Tang, Jay-Z and Nas\nAlso performing 50 Cent, Terror Squad\nFrom the top, we have the great Luda, Jeezy and Wayne\nT.I., Rick Ross, Rich Boy, Snoop and The Game\nAnd for my ladies, we have, Ne-Yo with Usher\nY'all have a seat, we be right back, mothafucka...\n\nCome on, this commercial break's almost over\nOutKast, M.J.G., you're at Talib's table\nFab, U.G.K., table seven, let's go, come on\nYo, Beans, Toney said \"Good looking on that haze\"\nCommercial, come on, let's go, guys...\nComing back in, five, four, three, two, one...\n\nYeah, check out my band playing, Rhythm Roots Allstars\nThey play for DipSet, E-40, Lil' Jon, Jennifer Hudson and Norah Jones\nMary J. Blige, with her shades on, I could tell by her stones\nOn the left, we have Lenny Kravitz, Puffy, Pharrell, Bus\nKeith Murray, Redman, hitting that double Dutch\nWhat an event, peace to Denzel\nGive this man a round of applause, he do it so well {*applause*}\n\nLadies and gents, ladies and gents...\nAlright, alright, have a seat, have a seat...\nWithout further adiou, he needs no introduction\nHe is my co-host... Shawn Ripple!\n(Alright, is this thing on? Eh, eh, sweetheart, come here\nGot a hundred dollar bill tattooed on my cock\nHeard you like to... blow money... hahaha)\n\nIt was amazing, I seen Robin Thicke and Robin Leech\nRobin Givens, Robin Williams and Meryl Streep\nA real award show, there's Kanye West\nPamela Anderson, and she brought both of them breasts\nParis Hilton and Lindsay, holding down Britney's skirt\nNo more free looks, you gotta put in work\nTo get a glimpse, seen Don Juan with all of his pimps\nAnd they hoes on they side, sipping they four-fives\nAnd Billy Dean...\n\nExcuse me, have you seen Alicia Keys?\nTell her the limo's outside, she's bouncing with me\nThe Don, y'all rappers don't steal my ash trays\nMy coat hangers is diamonded out like my last gates\nSuperhead, gave the low scoop to Halle\nShe said, before

shit hurt\nIt feel like somebody died or shot your old Earth\nBut fuck it, I fucked you on a chair with three legs\nBroken tables, had you screaming while you was biting on my cables\nWe slid to the washing machine and threw it on spin\nIf your pussy dry, spit on my dick and put it in\nMy dick's the bomb baby, marvelous hot steak\nPlus I'm conceited Starks make the biggest ho call rape\nI'm God Cipher Divine, love my pussy refined\nThat means clean, a FDS smell with a shine\nWord up, respect that ho"}}, {"title": "Winter Warz", "album": "Ironman", "year": "1996-10-29", "lyrics": "It's on {Where your sparkle at kid?}\n(RZArector)\n\nYes the shit is raw coming at your door\nStart to scream out loud, \"Wu-Tang's back for more\"\nYes the hour's four, I told you before\nPrepare for mic fights (and plus the cold war)\n\nThis rhyme you digest through the RZA console\nX Y  slam Nine Diagram pole\nRaekwon dropped the bomb, Hunchback Notre Dame\nGolden Arms is bronze Buddha palm hit Qu'ran\nIt blows extreme, mainstream be the theme, supreme team\nAmerica's Cream Team, redeemed\nVidal Sassoon, chrome tones hear the moans of Al Capone\nGun POW to the dome and split the bone\nWig blown off the ledge by the alleged\nFull-fledged, sledge RZA edge\nOne dose of my feroc' handheld trigger cuts\nA capella spitting shell paralyse if you get touched\nAnd critical mic cords, hanging like umbilical\nCords, dope swords, five star general\nRaw be the quote rap style sore throat\nThrough the fully operational, hand held tote, mhm\n\nYes the shit is raw coming at your door\nStart to scream out loud, \"Wu-Tang's back for more\"\n\nA hundred thousand times one, snatch up my styles get done\nI hold a title, and here's how my belt was won, check it\nSlick majestic, broke mics are left infected\nGerms start to spread through your crew through lack of effort\nYou asked for it, shot up the jams like syringes\nMy technique alone blows doors straight off the hinges\nMasked Avenger, I appear to blow your ear like wind\nWith a freestyle, sharper than the Indian spear\nSo sit back and let the king explore\nDescribe me, the kid's nice and he holds swords\nAnd his name, black attack's the nerve like migraines\nWith more gains than beggars on trains, livid sharp pains\nPoisonous Rebel like Deck, you can't destroy this\nYou get ambushed, skate, try to avoid this\nSide effects of hot raps and hot tracks\nA duffel bag full of guns son, dipped in black\nMy culture, glides and attacks you like a vulture\nGhostface in Madison Square is on your poster\n\nYes the shit is raw coming at your door\nStart to scream out loud, \"Wu-Tang's back for more\"\nYes the hour's four, I told you before\nPrepare for mic fights (and plus the cold war)\n\nBe on the lookout for this mass murderous suspect\nThat fills more body bags than apartments in projects\nAnd as far as the coroners know\nThe autopsy show it was a Shaolin blow\nPut on by my family brought to the academy\nOf the Wu and learnt how to\nFuck up your anatomy steadily, calm and deadly\nSpatter-head lyrics I lick through your transmit\nMCs submit to the will as I kill your\nJuvenile freestyle, civilize the mental\nDevils worship this like an icon\nBear-hugging mics with the grips of a python\n\nYes the shit is raw coming at your door\nStart to scream out loud, \"Wu-Tang's back for more\"\n\nYou heard other raps before but kept waiting\nFor the Son of Song, I keep dancehalls strong\nBeats never worthy of my cause, I prolong\nExtravaganza, time sits still\nNo propaganda, be wary of the skill\nAs I bring forth the music, make love to your eardrum\nDedicated to rap nigga, beware of the fearsome\nLebanon Don, Malcolm X beat threat\nCD massacre, murder to cassette\nI blow the shop up, you ain't seen nothing yet\nOne man ran, tryna get away from it\nPut your bifocal on, watch me a-cometh\nInto your chamber like Freddy enter dream\nDiscombumberate your technique and your scheme\nFour course applause, like a black jack to dat\nYou're stuck on stupid like I'm stuck on the map\nNowhere to go except next show bro\nEntertaining motherfuckers can't stop O\nIn battling, you don't want me to start tattling\nAll up on the stage 'cause y'all snakes keep rattling\nBitch, you ain't got nothing on the rich\nEvery other day my whole dress code switch\nSo just in case you wanna clock me like Sherry\nAll y'all crab bitches ain't got to worry\nCan't get a nigga like Don dime a dozen\nEven if I'm smoked out I can't be scoped out\nI'm too ill, I represent Park Hill\nSee my face on the twenty dollar bill\nCash it in, and get ten dollars back\nThe fat LP with Cappachino on the wax\nPass it in your thing, put valve up to twelve\nPut all the other LPs back on the shelf\nAnd smoke a blunt and dial 9-1-7\n1-6-0-4-9-3-11\nAnd you could get long dick hip-hop affection\nI damage any MC who step in my direction\nI'm Staten Island best son, fuck what you heard\nNiggas still talking that shit is absurd\nMy repertoire, is U.S.S.R\nP.L.O. style got thrown out the car\nAnd ran over by the Method Man Jeep\nDivine can't define my style is so deep\nLike pussy, my low cut fade stay bushy\nLike a porcupine, I part backs like a spine\nGut you like a blunt and reconstruct your design\nI know you want to diss me, but I can read your mind\n'Cause you weak in the knees like SWV\nTryna get a title like Wu Killa Bee\nKid change your habit, you know I'm friends with the Abbott\nMe and RZA rhyme name printed in the tablet\nUnder vets, we paid our debts for mad years\nHibernate the sound and now we out like bears\nIn Born Power, born physically, power speaking\nThe truth in the song be the pro-black teaching", "image": "https://images.genius.com/86aaa4a25c81fd34a671c2db7083cc80.800x800x1.jpg",

coming at your door\nStart to scream out loud, \"Wu-Tang's back for more\"\nYes the hour's four, I told you before\nPrepare for mic fights (and plus the cold war)\n\nThis rhyme you digest through the RZA console\nX Y  slam Nine Diagram pole\nRaekwon dropped the bomb, Hunchback Notre Dame\nGolden Arms is bronze Buddha palm hit Qu'ran\nIt blows extreme, mainstream be the theme, supreme team\nAmerica's Cream Team, redeemed\nVidal Sassoon, chrome tones hear the moans of Al Capone\nGun POW to the dome and split the bone\nWig blown off the ledge by the alleged\nFull-fledged, sledge RZA edge\nOne dose of my feroc' handheld trigger cuts\nA capella spitting shell paralyse if you get touched\nAnd critical mic cords, hanging like umbilical\nCords, dope swords, five star general\nRaw be the quote rap style sore throat\nThrough the fully operational, hand held tote, mhm\n\nYes the shit is raw coming at your door\nStart to scream out loud, \"Wu-Tang's back for more\"\n\nA hundred thousand times one, snatch up my styles get done\nI hold a title, and here's how my belt was won, check it\nSlick majestic, broke mics are left infected\nGerms start to spread through your crew through lack of effort\nYou asked for it, shot up the jams like syringes\nMy technique alone blows doors straight off the hinges\nMasked Avenger, I appear to blow your ear like wind\nWith a freestyle, sharper than the Indian spear\nSo sit back and let the king explore\nDescribe me, the kid's nice and he holds swords\nAnd his name, black attack's the nerve like migraines\nWith more gains than beggars on trains, livid sharp pains\nPoisonous Rebel like Deck, you can't destroy this\nYou get ambushed, skate, try to avoid this\nSide effects of hot raps and hot tracks\nA duffel bag full of guns son, dipped in black\nMy culture, glides and attacks you like a vulture\nGhostface in Madison Square is on your poster\n\nYes the shit is raw coming at your door\nStart to scream out loud, \"Wu-Tang's back for more\"\nYes the hour's four, I told you before\nPrepare for mic fights (and plus the cold war)\n\nBe on the lookout for this mass murderous suspect\nThat fills more body bags than apartments in projects\nAnd as far as the coroners know\nThe autopsy show it was a Shaolin blow\nPut on by my family brought to the academy\nOf the Wu and learnt how to\nFuck up your anatomy steadily, calm and deadly\nSpatter-head lyrics I lick through your transmit\nMCs submit to the will as I kill your\nJuvenile freestyle, civilize the mental\nDevils worship this like an icon\nBear-hugging mics with the grips of a python\n\nYes the shit is raw coming at your door\nStart to scream out loud, \"Wu-Tang's back for more\"\n\nYou heard other raps before but kept waiting\nFor the Son of Song, I keep dancehalls strong\nBeats never worthy of my cause, I prolong\nExtravaganza, time sits still\nNo propaganda, be wary of the skill\nAs I bring forth the music, make love to your eardrum\nDedicated to rap nigga, beware of the fearsome\nLebanon Don, Malcolm X beat threat\nCD massacre, murder to cassette\nI blow the shop up, you ain't seen nothing yet\nOne man ran, tryna get away from it\nPut your bifocal on, watch me a-cometh\nInto your chamber like Freddy enter dream\nDiscombumberate your technique and your scheme\nFour course applause, like a black jack to dat\nYou're stuck on stupid like I'm stuck on the map\nNowhere to go except next show bro\nEntertaining motherfuckers can't stop O\nIn battling, you don't want me to start tattling\nAll up on the stage 'cause y'all snakes keep rattling\nBitch, you ain't got nothing on the rich\nEvery other day my whole dress code switch\nSo just in case you wanna clock me like Sherry\nAll y'all crab bitches ain't got to worry\nCan't get a nigga like Don dime a dozen\nEven if I'm smoked out I can't be scoped out\nI'm too ill, I represent Park Hill\nSee my face on the twenty dollar bill\nCash it in, and get ten dollars back\nThe fat LP with Cappachino on the wax\nPass it in your thing, put valve up to twelve\nPut all the other LPs back on the shelf\nAnd smoke a blunt and dial 9-1-7\n1-6-0-4-9-3-11\nAnd you could get long dick hip-hop affection\nI damage any MC who step in my direction\nI'm Staten Island best son, fuck what you heard\nNiggas still talking that shit is absurd\nMy repertoire, is U.S.S.R\nP.L.O. style got thrown out the car\nAnd ran over by the Method Man Jeep\nDivine can't define my style is so deep\nLike pussy, my low cut fade stay bushy\nLike a porcupine, I part backs like a spine\nGut you like a blunt and reconstruct your design\nI know you want to diss me, but I can read your mind\n'Cause you weak in the knees like SWV\nTryna get a title like Wu Killa Bee\nKid change your habit, you know I'm friends with the Abbott\nMe and RZA rhyme name printed in the tablet\nUnder vets, we paid our debts for mad years\nHibernate the sound and now we out like bears\nIn Born Power, born physically, power speaking\nThe truth in the song be the pro-black teaching"}}, {"title": "Wise", "album": "Wu-Tang Clan & Friends Unreleased", "year": null, "lyrics": "I think it happened on a Saturday\nI heard the

A monument in hip-hop\nCarved out, in the giant landscape of broken rocks\nWhether heard in herb spots, jukebox or malt shops\nUncut live, drop eighty-five, in one shot\nSpotlight hits the metal mic, majority stare\nHeard the Wu snare, while my iris cut down the glare\nWalk a road the great length you find too long to measure\nMy Clan'll make me rhyme like D. Banner under pressure\nNo surprise, double disc touched five\nThose elements kept environments colonized\nWith the high flying depth-defying flow like the Rebel\nRight there, but you're one light year from my level\n\nUh-huh.. yeah.. yo.. check it.. yo..\nBottles goin' off in the church, we broke the wine\nSlapped the pastor, didn't know Pop had asthma\nHe pulled out his blue bible, change fell out his coat\nThree condoms, two dice, one bag of dope\nOooh! Rev. ain't right, his church ain't right\nDeacon is a pimp, tell by his ice\nMrs. Parks said, \"Brother Starks, meet you at the numbers spot\nHeard you got red tops out, and I want a lot\"\nShirley fainted dead on the spot\nTwo ushers slipped eighty dollars right out the pot\nOh shit!\n\nEgyptian, brown skin brown suede Timbs\nMasqueradin X-rated throw blades, all occasions\nRound nozzle touchdown, Haagen-Daas goggles White House\nGucci flag on the roof, call us rock groups\nMere intelligent, buy Neimann Marcus out\nNo doubt, all we saw he bought, Lori mom's all blow\nWas simple, blamp instrumentals run camps the stamps get you\nThe way we lamp, fans come and get you\nPlay, fullback strapped like a fuck, war at\nThe black, Carlo Gambino's stash house in Hackensack\nPack capsules, Green Bay 'em lay 'em down like wax do\nIt's all actual we build, like Crash Crew\nCoconut, incense, one sentence, aiyyo\nControl the holy flinch hit this, new whips\nRoman numerals, sun splash them niggas like, Tango and Cash\nAlcatraz cats roll out fast..\n\nWu thousand nuthin but hardcore\nWe tryin to get land riches and more\nGhost put me on to it\nWe just do it, floss or whatever\nTake care of the business, there's too many roughnecks\nGive two of these to Flex, tell him it's real rap like Ghost\nHad to beat niggas with toast\n'Cause we got clientele, we lay it down flat\nPulled out on y'all kid, now where your mans at?\nFakin the real like, \"Damn I can't stand Cappa'\"\nThen my wardrobe flooded the next chapter\nY'all heard about us like we heard about you\nBless the mic with reality, hit you with the virtue\nCalm down not tryin to hurt you, burst through\nFat shit, fatter than all y'all nigga\u2019s outfits\nWe the glitch like Y2K\nCatch the ball when it drop, guns pop, y'all have a nice day\n\"Doctor Kanabuta, Iron Man, he is invincible\nHis remarkable armor is supreme!\"\n\nYo, sometimes I'm liable to spaz and break fool\nGrab my gun, select one, snatch son\nPut the barrel by his face, blast one by his eardrum\nPiss run, you drop the e shot\nScreamin like a bitch, kicks to your face\nShots to the body that shake like the bass\nI'm Ghostfaced up, military style down\nNuff ammunitions of rounds across the chest\n\nSkip to the intro, rap through post\nSmashed a fresh ball of wax ceasar\nFlashy penthouse that overlooks the vista\nWally Moc' half tied, swimmin trunks\nThree chunks of ice sit in Johnny Walker for advice\nCatch the moment, fundraiser at will, work with the homeless\nPolish diamond edge, Flintstone shit, sealed in a comb pick\nCarefully, swing the B seven series Christmas lights\nToo bright Ghost is comin y'all fix the mirrors\nRelax like pudding, confidence strangle my man couldn't\nExile he no longer in the hood\nBless the kid that max the most\nMe I turn a wedding into hoax\nRoses tied to bombs on posts\nOn commercial breaks, piss in the apple juice\nRasta nigga rock the big do's\nJiffy

A monument in hip-hop\nCarved out, in the giant landscape of broken rocks\nWhether heard in herb spots, jukebox or malt shops\nUncut live, drop eighty-five, in one shot\nSpotlight hits the metal mic, majority stare\nHeard the Wu snare, while my iris cut down the glare\nWalk a road the great length you find too long to measure\nMy Clan'll make me rhyme like D.

and your skull T-shirt\nYou say, why did you do it with him today?\nAnd sniff me out like I was Tanqueray\n\nWhy you acting like you more trouble than Tony Starks, 'n'\nYou need to just 'walk away' like Kelly Clarkson\nI know, we was free to sleep around town\nBut I figured you said that cause how I get down\nNot cause you was out there, messing around\nI would of told you, once you go Ghost, you never go back\nTry g'ing me, like I don't know how to mack\nI'm a don - top of the line, I stay flying\nStop trying, to keep covering the lies and\nUsing my credit cards to buy diamonds\nWe need to straighten this out, get to the bottom of it all\nLet's go, before we start the war\nBegin with two reasons why we need to talk\nAnd stop popping up in my cribs all over New York\nAnd, that's stalking, you such trouble and no good\nThem fighting words in my block, when we in the hood\n\nI cheated myself, like I knew, I would\nI told you, I was trouble and know, that I'm no good\n\nYou had to be a nasty girl and try to play me\nNasty girl, nasty girl, try to play me\n\nAyo, I knew you was trouble when I first laid eyes on you\nTemperature's so hot, the heat just rise with you\nLet me ride with you, talk about your mistakes\nYou cheated yourself but these are the breaks\nAnd it never be the same again, cause of old boy\nBut oh boy, together we make so much joy\nIn the sands and oh, what a web we weave\nBut you played me, so I had to roll up my sleeves and\nHunt you down, holding the next man's stacks\nNow you sorry, tryin' bring that old thing back and\nAct like we can rekindle that flame\nIt's a shame, how you can't get me off the brain\nHear that lame? You love how I bring the pain?\nGot the rug burns stinging and you saying my name\nSay my name, that's right, I'm high post\nGet the champagne, love, word up, we gon' toast\n\n\nYou had to be nasty girl and try to play me\nNasty girl, girl\nYou can't leave the kid... can't leave the kid\nDon't worry, I'mma be around forever, nasty girl\nDon't forget, I'mma be around forever, nasty\n\nSweet reunion, Jamaica and Spain\nWe're like how we were again\nI'm in the tub, you're on the seat\nLick your lips, as I soak my feet\n\nYo, get the bath and body works, pumkin and spice creams\nTogether like Cheech and Chong, we make nice dreams\nFight scenes, I take the good with the bad\nCause you give the best brains that I ever had and\nAnything worth having is hard to keep\nI love you like my coffee so hot and so sweet\nSo let's, stick it out, so we never regret it\nI could forgive the past, but I never forget it\n\n\nGot to forgive the past, but I never forget it\nNasty girl... nasty girl... try to play me\nNasty girl, you had to be a nasty and try to play me\nNasty girl... try to play me, try to play me\nNasty girl, got to forgive the past, but I never forget it"}}], "artist": "Ghostface Killah"}
