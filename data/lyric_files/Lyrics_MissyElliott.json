juice, let's go X it out\nThe music's bangin', way down in my soul\nWhen you dance behind me, I lose all control\nMake me grind my hips, make me move my waist\nWhen the music comes on, you take my

do\nGave you all my dough when you needed it all the time\nAnd if you planning on leaving me again\nThen give me a sign\n\nBeep me 911 or call me on my cell phone\nI'll call you back\nTo see what you gon' tell me\nYou don't wanna date\nNo ifs, ands, or waits it's over babe\nBeep me 911 or call me on my cell phone\nI'll call you back\nTo see what you gon' tell me\nYou don't wanna date\nNo ifs, ands, or waits it's over babe\n\nWhy you cheating on me, can you tell me what I've done\nI thought you was the one but you just a hit and run\nGave up clubs and parties, I put them aside\nLeft me in the dark with no kind of sign\n(Why don't you give me a sign?)\n\nBeep me 911 or call me on my cell phone\nI'll call you back\nTo see what you gon' tell me\nYou don't wanna date\nNo ifs, ands, or waits it's over babe, it's over\n(No thinking twice)\nBeep me 911 or call me on my cell phone\nI'll call you back\nTo see what you gon' tell me\nYou don't wanna date\nNo ifs, ands, or waits it's over babe, it's over\n\nAll my friends say I can do better than you\nMaybe they was right cause I feel like a fool\nBut I can't let you go until you take some time\nTo tell me why you left me without a goddamn sign\n\nBeep me 911 or call me on my cell phone\nI'll call you back\nTo see what you gon' tell me\nYou don't wanna date\nNo ifs, ands, or waits it's over babe, it's over\nBeep me 911 or call me on my cell phone\nI'll call you back\nTo see what you gon' tell me\nYou don't wanna date\nNo ifs, ands, or waits it's over babe, it's over\n\nType of nigga made built to last\nLook homegirl I pump like gas when\nGet your friend and your girl and them\nMy sex drive workout like a gym, Kim\nWas the girl that I used to hit\nYou the girl that I gotta quit\nSee the kitty Kit\nGotta gold it like a light\nIn the night you the freak come out\nWe don't bite\nNo diggity, who took you out\nNo doubt when I first got down\nMade the bro' shout\nLook out, make it live\nDip and dive, staying alive\nShoot me sugar, there it is\nNow we talking square biz\nI'm leaving you without arrears\nBut I still luh the kids\nWhat you think, I'm hen pecked\nGirl get your mind checked\nTake the time, recollect\nI just gave you disrespect\n\nAh, like that\nLike that\nBeep me 911, baby\nAha, aha, aha, aha...\nSay what, say what\nMisdemeanor, 702\nWhatch'all gonna do?\nFellas?\nDon't beep them 911\nDon't beep

self\nSo when ya'll see me in the street\nThis is what I want ya'll to do\nFix your lips, put 'em together nicely and say\nSay it along, say it along now\nSay \"She's a bitch!\"\n\nI was walkin' real

shit but I come thru like a storm\nI keep my piece so sweet, yeah, nice and warm\nAnd all he could feel was this \"Love baby\"\n\nI don't give a fuck about what they think, what they say\nThey can call me a freak, call me anything they wanna name\nI don't give a, I don't give a\nI just wanna take him home\nTake him to the house, then turn him out\nHe ain't checkin' for you\nI don't give a fuck about what they think, what they say\nThey can call me a freak, call me anything they wanna name\nI don't give a, I don't give a\nI just wanna take him home\nTake him to the house, then turn him

playa betta fall back\nClick clack, cock back, semi automatic track\nDrink a lot of similac, shorty betta fall back\nI blocka-blocka, straight jocka\nMatter fact, the face snappa\nMoney stacka, no slacka\nHit record, gun strappa\nI hit-hit, hear my click-click\nTwo snaps, you hit\nThen I click-click\nI make cash, pay them bills\nI pay them bills to buy new wheels\nI wear high hills, I touch and feel\nCatch me in your mans grill\nMy record deal, my movie deal\nIs super sick-sick, I click-click\nAnd if you doubt me I'll click-click\nSmack dem boi's, I will destroy\nHit-hit, straight down and spilt-spilt ya boi\nI kick-kick like karate flicks-flicks\nYa get ya ass bit, don't make me have click\n\nWho dat, who dat, playa betta fall back\nSo step back, playa betta fall back\nClick clack, cock back, semi automatic track\nDrink a lot of similac, shorty betta fall back"}}, {"title": "Crazy Feelings", "album": "Da Real World", "year": "1999-06-22", "lyrics": "I was in love\nThat's what it

raunchy, raunchy\n\nGood riddance, to niggas and bitches bullshittin\nI house MC's like baths and full kitchens, ready or not\nDoc,hood lynchin, icey flows, I write with wool mittens\nIt's two not one, Missy dot dot com, come once in the blue like free hot lunch\nSo once its on, turn it up, chickens flockin in\nShoppin at birds are us, murderous, don't blame me, blame the music\nI write with napalms in my hands, flame the fuses, like ca psss, off you go\nI'm nice battin, I practice when the park is closed\nI'm that man who squats out of jeeps and vans\nJump to roof to roof on the TV cam, I fuck a model\nI go out with the cheapest tramps, pussy have me trippin\nLike Kima, Keisha and Pam, I remain cool like, like open house on a school night\nAnimal House gettin' thrown out for food fights, PPP strictly don't give a fuck\nAn Brick City niggas strictly don't give a fuck\n\nLet me intervene, come between, like dick through your jeans\nHang down to your knees, its mwa the don-wan, carry on, D.A.N to the danger\nY'all MC's in a whole lot of danger, change up all your rhymes you need beats\nMy beats you see completely unique, forgive thee\nSee its the shots of Henessey that's in me, Reggie Noble through after me\n\nIt takes two to tingle, and two to fuck\nI done fucked in Range Rovers to Isuzu trucks, used to move weight\nNow you makin moves to duck, built solid without bolts, screws and nuts\nPussy tight jiffy lube it up, Doc came up, hoes use to hang up\nNow my arm close hang up, my crew is deeper than Karl Kani pockets\nWe don't buy bullets, we ask what size rockets, for thee occasion\nOne shot will have you ravin', like Symone when the four four is blown\nTwo minutes later I'll make it hotter, snap you from the vine\nTo my um blada a boom glada\n\nSo what you wanna do, what you wanna do\n\nYo I got the chicken, the brew taken next, an much room Def Squad in the house\nDrop you drawers, tell your boyfriend ease up, and park his car\n\nI'm from the south you better watch your mouth, It's the M.I\nThe S.I, if you try then you die, I don't take no mercy on you suckers so\nWould you still be in love baby, if I cut your throat, cut the jokes\nI ain't got no love for yo, no friends with those, who imitate me ya bold\nMy style I own, I'mma have to steal your flow, you know me Joe\nI gotta say no more, BITCH!\nThats right nigga, It's

bitches bullshittin\nI house MC's like baths and full kitchens, ready or not\nDoc,hood lynchin, icey flows, I write with wool mittens\nIt's two not one, Missy dot dot com, come once in the blue like free hot lunch\nSo once its on, turn it up, chickens flockin in\nShoppin at birds are us, murderous, don't blame me, blame the music\nI write with napalms in my hands, flame the fuses, like ca psss, off you go\nI'm nice battin, I practice when the park is closed\nI'm that man who squats out of jeeps and vans\nJump to roof to roof on the TV cam, I fuck a model\nI go out with the cheapest tramps, pussy have me trippin\nLike Kima, Keisha and Pam, I remain cool like, like open house on a school night\nAnimal House gettin' thrown out for food fights, PPP strictly don't give a fuck\nAn Brick City niggas strictly don't give a fuck\n\nLet me intervene, come between, like dick through your jeans\nHang down to your knees, its mwa the don-wan, carry on, D.A.N to the danger\nY'all MC's in a whole lot of danger, change up all your rhymes you need beats\nMy beats you see completely unique, forgive thee\nSee its the shots of Henessey that's in me, Reggie Noble through after me\n\nIt takes two to tingle, and two to fuck\nI done fucked in Range Rovers to Isuzu trucks, used to move weight\nNow you makin moves to duck, built solid without bolts, screws and nuts\nPussy tight jiffy lube it up, Doc came up, hoes use to hang up\nNow my arm close hang up, my crew is deeper than Karl Kani pockets\nWe don't buy bullets, we ask what size rockets, for thee occasion\nOne shot will have you ravin', like Symone when the four four is blown\nTwo minutes later I'll make it hotter, snap you from the vine\nTo my um blada a boom glada\n\nSo what you wanna do, what you wanna do\n\nYo I got the chicken, the brew taken next, an much room Def Squad in the house\nDrop you drawers, tell your boyfriend ease up, and park his car\n\nI'm from the south you better watch your mouth, It's the M.I\nThe S.I, if you try then you die, I don't take no mercy on you suckers so\nWould you still be in love baby, if I cut your throat, cut the jokes\nI ain't got no love for yo, no friends with those, who imitate me ya bold\nMy style I own, I'mma have to steal your flow, you know me Joe\nI gotta say no more, BITCH!\nThats right nigga, It's Misdemeanor here, Redman, Timbaland uhh\nMuthafucka! 3 triple zero, the

Hale-Bopp\nSmoking trees non stop\nThen I send a televize from satelite on Nightline\nYeah, wouldn't you like to get away\nTo the moon\nWe shine like stars\nLock down like metal bars\n\nAy yo, I'm kinda scared to do this\n'Cause Jimmy tryna scare me saying\nI'mma give away my publishing\nBut um, it don't matter\n'Cause I write my own shit, do my own shit\nSing my own shit\nShit be a hit\nShit

Kim kicks off the track with a fiery guest verse, which is actually quite interesting. Missy decided to have two established artists contributing to her album before she even graces the stage with first her finest vocals and then shows off her funky flow on the second verse. I imagine that having 2 major artists talking her up before she even says a word, is to really show that she deserves the hype (and the 2 Hype Williams directed music videos on her debut album)."]}]}}, "comment_count": 0, "community": true, "custom_preview": null, "has_voters": true, "id": 3523426, "pinned": false, "share_url": "https://genius.com/3523426", "source": null, "state":

treat me good, I won't settle for less\nYou a hot boy, a rock boy\nA fun toy, tote a Glock boy\nWhere you live, is it by yourself?\nCan I move with you, do you need some help?\nI cook boy, I'll give you more\nI'm a fly girl, and I like those\n1 - \nHot boyz\nBaby you got what I want\nSee cause y'all be driving Lexus jeeps\nAnd the Benz jeeps, and the Lincoln jeeps\nNothin' cheaper, got them

rock boy, on top boy\nAnd I like those\nRepeat 1\n\nYo only take 'em thugged out\nSlightly bugged out, fuck with his tongue out\nKnow the job ain't getting done, until the body getting drugged out\nHot boy, keep me right\nPlay your part and I'll keep it tight\nWhere else you gonna be in the middle of the night\nBut up in the sheets with me aiight\nGangsta, true to your gang, street master\nYou the one I need when there's beef, street blaster\nAin't afraid to stop a cat, plus pop a cat, huh\nSoldier, cash money, rule your world\nWhat's topping that?\nHuh, S-4-3-0 keep me on my toes\nGet a tingle in my spine, what spot? Only he knows\nHe's a hot boy, Missy sing it out and I'm gon' spit it\nRuff Ryders scream it loud, daddy is you with it\nIf your team can't handle my bitches then we gon' ride\nBrickhouse stallions, keep thugs open wide, huh\n'Illadelph's best E-V-E stay committed\nMess with many, but if he ain't the realer\nI ain't with it, with it\n\nYo, mami, what the deal?\nAin't no heat fuckin' hotter than the heat a nigga hold\nI think you really should be told that I deal with long shafts\nThat keep a long blast (blast)\nNow look at a nigga and peel off fast (come on)\nWord you got your

give you a hug (let's stick together)\nI got problems just like you (woo, ooh, yeah)\nAnd everybody needs some love\n\nWhen you're feeling bad, some friends they can't be found\n(Look around, look around, be found)\nCause some people love it just to see you when you're down\nBut it's ok, pick yourself up, start over again\n(That's what you gotta do)\nIf you try you will, you will succeed in the end\n(The end, I know you will, oh yeah)\n\n\nShake a hand, shake a hand y'all, come on (oh shake somebody's hand)\nTo every woman, every man y'all, come on (oh, to every woman, every man)\nTell a

anger gossip or just plain\nOl bullshit became ignorant to me\nWhen you realize in a blink of a eye\nYou walking down a church aisle\nAnd that was meant for weddings and happiness\nAnd realize the same church aisle are used\nTo view a loved one for the last time\nFrom the world trade families the left eye family big pun family\nYou know biggie family Pac family to the hip hop family\nWe all under construction\nTrying to rebuild you know ourselves\nHip hop done gained respect from you\nKnow not even respect form but just like rock and roll\nAnd it took us a lot of hard work to get here\nSo all that hatin' and animosity between folks you need to kill it\nWith a skillet you don't see Bill Gates and Donald trump\nArguing wit each other 'cuz both of them got paper\nAnd the they got better shit to do get more paper\nSo all I'm sayin' is, let's take hip hop back to the rope follow me\nMomma say, momma sah, momma can you do this?\nTalkin' like you badest when you just know dat

radio cats ,listers or plain old haters\nA small piece of my album\nWhich is titled under construction under construction\nSimply states that I'm a work in progress, I'm working on myself\nYou know uh, every since Aaliyah passed\nI view life in a uh, more valuable way looking at hate\nAnd anger gossip or just plain\nOl bullshit became ignorant to me\nWhen you realize in a blink of a eye\nYou walking down a church aisle\nAnd that was meant for weddings and happiness\nAnd realize the same church aisle are used\nTo view a loved one for the last time\nFrom the world trade families the left eye family big pun family\nYou know biggie family Pac family to the hip hop family\nWe all under construction\nTrying to rebuild you know ourselves\nHip hop done gained respect from you\nKnow not even respect form but just like rock and roll\nAnd it took us a lot of hard work to get here\nSo all that hatin' and animosity between folks you need to kill it\nWith a skillet you don't see Bill Gates and Donald trump\nArguing wit each other 'cuz both of them got paper\nAnd the they got better shit to do get more paper\nSo all I'm sayin' is, let's take hip hop back to the rope follow me\nMomma say, momma sah, momma can you do this?\nTalkin' like you badest when you just know dat is\nEvery time I come out ya'll be like who dat is\nBe like more like Ashanti and be unfoolish\nYou don't really want to break it wit me\nYou wear gata I sport the fendi\nMy Lamborghini against you Benzi\nDirty diamonds and your ring see mine like cling cling\nDing ding ding da ding ding ding ding\nI used to get so high they call me Ming Lee\nSpiked up my hair done like Don King\nHaters keep on hatin' 'cause dem don't worry weed\nDem don't worry weed den me and Timothy\nM I S E slimed out my body\nBang bang to

beat\nStep on the chair and dance like who\nDance like the freaks, now wat you came to do\nI came to shake shake my booty down like the party\nI'm underated, glad I made it, idependent, orperated\nI never hesitate haters keep me motivated\nThe beat is penetrated I'll timmy regulate it\nAnd we layed it in the shade and drink a glass of lemonade\nDamm, I'm faded ain't no other way to say it ain't that complicated\nAin't no other chicks gon' ever make me feel like invaded\nI keep droppin' hits like water breakin' to centimeters and I'm dialatin'\nRadio impatient ooh, come 1 check my translation\nFrom my observation my fans is real patient\nThey don't wanna hear the laughs so stop fakin'\nGreezy like bacon, keep my stomach achin'\nIf you wanna battle let there b no more delayin'\nI hope you did some prayin' 'cause when I come swayin'\nPop shu pop, pop yea sometimes I flow sometimes quick\nYou was on the verge to kissin' ass so slick\nI'd be on the verge or makin' hits after hits\nThis the kind of shit that tell yo momma don't forget\nGo to the floor, now tell me wat you want\nGrab me a drink, now wat you gon'do\nI'm here to shake, shake my booty down down to

ain't nothing wrong wit tastin your magic stick\n\nI bet it taste like candy, made to melt in my mouth\nI know you got plenty, baby you the shit\nNow what you workin wit candy made to melt in my mouth\nI know you got plenty, I like the way, I like the way\nI like the way, I like the way\n\nI like the way you work your stick boo\nThe way you work it like voodoo\nThe way you wind and you wind and you grind\nDon't stop the way you work your stick\nBaby the way you work your stick\nBaby keep on and keep on and keep on keep goin\n\nMy ex boyfriend had to go\nHe didn't know how to work that magic stick\nBut I found a guy that sure do love\nIt's so true his love is cla-hassic yeah oohhh\n\n\n\nI could play Janet you could play J.D\nIf you like Beyonce you could play Jay-Z\nCheck for them other chicks cos they not me\nThey're just some copy cats there's only one Missy\nM-to the I double ss don't test\nI'm hard as the cushion on a bullet proof vest\nBut you got me whipped like slaves in the days\nYou're cool as the shade and ice and lemonade\nI think I wanna marry you baby I will carry\nGuess it's necessary and on the contrary\nYou be mister right and mister legendary\nThe more I fall in love the more it gets scary"}}, {"title": "Missy's Finale", "album": "Supa Dupa Fly ", "year": "1997-07-15", "lyrics": "Yo, you have come almost to the close of my album\nBut before I go I

industry cause Missy in the lead\n{*scratching*} Uhh, I'm talkin to you man\nWith my upper hand, the fans call me Dapper Dan\nWhen I was young my pops, throw rocks\nAlways shit talk to my moms and call the cops\nCouldn't wait 'til I was nice and grown\nSick of daddy mouth 'til six in the morn'\nOn and on and on 'til the record scratch\nAnd if I made a few scraps I would never come back (YES!)\nTake moms with me and a few ADAT's\nAnd make a song about that and tell pops it's a wrap (YES!)\nOah-KAYYYYY!\n hold up\n\nY'all don't really know my life\nY'all don't really know my struggles and how much liquor I guzzle (YES!)\nY'all don't really know my fears\nAnd how many years to get here but I'm ready to rumble\n\nYeah, I be that throwback cat, I throwback 'gnac\nI spit hot raps, then I check my traps\nPockets stop the bulk, green up like the Hulk\nRam up in somethin like that nigga Marshall Faulk\nI'm a low key nigga, a O.G. nigga\nEntertain my guests in \"The Basement\" like

it away\n\nEvery time I spit I blow one or two speakers\nTop model diva but my name not Eva\nYeah I bring fever rocking classic adidas\nI'm straight off the heater ripping needles off the meter\nHere I go, flip my flow\nBack it up then I drop it low\nIt's a must cause I'm dangerous\nI'll be a hassle on the busta call me angel dust\nI talk shit di, didn't stutter\n2005 MC's in trouble\nYou run for cover hide under your covers\nCause you gone need more protection than a magnum rubber\n\nAh, ah, on\nAh, ah, on\nAh, ah-ah, ah-ah\nAh, ah, on and it's\n\nMissy finna spit shit simply raw\nMisdemeanor always make MCs feel small\nStick you on the table with a plastic cup\nSay grace, then eat ya ass up\nY'all just rookies, virgins, and nookies\nNot my competition you skip or play hookie\nAin't nobody here that can tear the track up\nAnd naw I ain't done rapping so shut the hell up\nKeep it simple every time I flow\nIf you step to me I shall throw blows\nRaise up like I's break nose\nI ain't about talking I'll lay 'em down slow\nAnd for sure y'all know\nMisdemeanor got 'em by the neck low\nIce cold heart like zero below\nIf you wanna battle me then playa say so\n\n\nLet me tell you what I'm all about\nAbout spitting hot rhymes on out\nYeah Pharrell did the beat oh yes\nAnd the way he put it down he make it sound so (fresh)\nI be the best don't second guess\nWhen it comes to other rappers bout it boy get flexed\nWhen I say I'm tight as wife beaters\nMissy bout to teach you how to follow the leader\nHit the club in a blue two seater\nLooking like I'm finna cock a nine millimeter\nGet out with my high hill cuffs\nTwisting my ass cause I know what guys want\nLicking my lips like I'm taking him home\nTeasing and teasing I'm faking the funk\nShaking my titties like I wanna bone\nBend

you\nWait\nWait a minute\nNow if I drive by your house (house)\nAnd see some bitch in your bed, under the spreads\nGiving you.....head\nThen I'm gonna turn it out (hhaay)\n\nI'm the only one who keep you satisfied\nAnd though were not together I remember what you like\nSo tell them chicks to step off cause I fill your appetite\nAnd I'm the only woman who gon do it like you like\n(Hey uh)\nWhat part don't you get?\n(hey hey)\nEven though I'm not your girl anymore\nAnd you don't want me no more\nI deserve to know who you sleepin' wit\n(ooooh yyeeaah)\nIs she better then me? (me me)\nDo she cook, do she clean?\nDo she sew, do she sting?\nCan she do these things?\nCause I...\n\nI still love ya baby\nMakes no difference to me\nAnd I still wantcha baby\nWant to be the one

myself, I'mma let you know\nYou don't play, games wit' me\nBut before I go, betta leave my dough\n\nI'mma fool for you (yea)\nBut you seem to think my love's a joke (it ain't a joke boo)\nI get no love from you (yea)\nLike all these times I did before\nI think I'll pass on you (yea)\nBecause of the way you been actin' lately\nI get no cash from you (yea)\nIf you want me to stay, you must be

down to the dogs\nYou trickin' off with these chickens, I thought you ain't have no flaws\nKeep yo dick in they jaws, Peter shoulda stayed in his draws\nNow I'm out the door and you can't claim me no more\nThe loss is yours\nHow you gonna slumber wit' a bitch I'm supposed to be cool wit'\nWent to grade school wit', couldn't pay me to believe you hit it\nTo think I footed all the bills and now you breakin '\nStop accusin' me of that dumb shit I don't even participate in\nYou wasted my valuable time there's money to make\nScared to set foot in another relationship cuz of the heartache\nHeartbreak Hotel no not Faith, Kelly, and Whitney, no it's Brat, Aaliyah and\nMissy You miss me cuz we finished\nI'll just keep the keys to the 20 inch rim ride with the TVs in it\nYou don't need it, beat it, it's mine\nKiss my ass like your heart was in it (stupid ass)\nKeep stickin' them chickens\nSend Peter straight to the clinic nigga\n\nSee I'mma give you your props tho\nYou like a bad ass motherfucker\nRunnin' two bitches at one time\nWhen I'm flyin' out, she flyin' in\nSayin' the same shit, spittin' the same game\nWho the fuck you think I am\nWilly Limpdick or somebody,

runnin' through (yea)\nUsed to be best friends, down wit' me\n\nWhen I'm gone, you're alone\nYou stickin' them chickens 'til I get home\nWhen I'm home, you're wit' me\nKissin' on my ass, tryna be wit' me\nWell it's done, this I know\nSeen it for myself, I'mma let you know\nYou don't play, games wit' me\nBut before I go, betta leave my dough\n\nI'mma fool for you (yea)\nBut you seem to think my love's a joke (it ain't a joke boo)\nI get no love from you (yea)\nLike all these times I did before\nI think I'll pass on you (yea)\nBecause of the way you been actin' lately\nI get no cash from you (yea)\nIf you want me to stay, you must be cra-crazy\n\n\nDedication\nIt was jus a bad relation (yes it was, yes it was)\nWhen I think it cuts my insides\nThe tears, they fall deep down from my eyes\n(repeat)\n\nDoo doo doo, doo doo doo\nDoo doo doo doo\nDoo doo doo doo\nDoo doo doo, doo doo doo (wha say what, uh uh uh)\nDoo doo doo, doo doo doo\nDoo doo doo doo\nDoo doo doo doo (Da

draws\nNow I'm out the door and you can't claim me no more\nThe loss is yours\nHow you gonna slumber wit' a bitch I'm supposed to be cool wit'\nWent to grade school wit', couldn't pay me to believe you hit it\nTo think I footed all the bills and now you breakin '\nStop accusin' me of that dumb shit I don't even participate in\nYou wasted my valuable time there's money to make\nScared to set foot in another relationship cuz of the heartache\nHeartbreak Hotel no not Faith, Kelly, and Whitney, no it's Brat, Aaliyah and\nMissy You miss me cuz we finished\nI'll just keep the keys to the 20 inch rim ride with the TVs in it\nYou don't need it, beat it, it's mine\nKiss my ass like your heart was in it (stupid ass)\nKeep stickin' them chickens\nSend Peter straight to the clinic nigga\n\nSee I'mma give you your props tho\nYou like a bad ass motherfucker\nRunnin' two bitches at one time\nWhen I'm flyin' out, she flyin' in\nSayin' the same shit, spittin' the same game\nWho the fuck you

sounds, see my peeps\nGive them pounds, now look who it be\nIt be me me me and Timothy\nLook like it's bout to rain, what a shame\nI got the Armor-All to shine up the stain\nOh Missy try to

window)\n(I can't stand the rain)\n\nI feel the wind\n5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10\n9, 10\nBegin: I sit on Hills like Lauryn\nUntil the rain starts coming down, pouring\nChill, I got my umbrella\nMy finger waves these days, they fall like Humpty\nChumpy, I break up with him before he dump me\nTo have me, (I can't stand the rain) yes you lucky (against my window)\n\n(I can't stand the rain against my window)\n(I I can't stand the rain against my window)\n(I can't stand the rain against my window)\n(I can't stand the rain)\n(I can't stand the rain)\n(I can't stand the rain)\n(I can't stand the

No use in talkin, better get to walkin\nBetter get them chicks who turn tricks cause I'm just too smart\nMan, I hate men who lie, who look me in my eyes\nCome up with alibis, for the thousandth

over and done\n\n\nI be comin with a rap on a ballad\nYou should vote Misdemeanor on your ballots\nCause you know I blow your mind any time that I rhyme\nAnd I'll be down for a challenge\nI'm, wicked, I-C-K-icked\nNot Twista twisted\nFrom coast to coast I brag and boast\nI'm better than most and sufficient\nI got that good love, that goody-goody-good love\nThat puddy-puddy-pusha\nSlick talkin

You know what I'm saying? So\nI'mma talk about this one I had a fewa years ago\nI had a friend named Cutie Tootie\nTootie turned tricks to get some Gucci\nKnown as loose bootie\nTruly, she was a freak in the evenin\nAnd if she wasn't teasin, then give me one reason\nWhy she do dat? Always knew dat\nShe was hot as da nectar\nHector said he pecked her, direspected her\nCause he bang bang swang in his dingalang\nBroke his back long range\nAnd make the ugly bitch sing\nOooh oooh\nWhy you hurtin me?\nTell me why more\nOooh oooh\nOooh oooh\nWhy you hurtin me?\nTell me why more\nOooh oooh\nCutie Tootie with her sight\nAnd if she humped Ralph\nShe humped Bobby, Ricky and Mike\nTight, is the way she wore her dresses\nHas she learned her lesson\nFrom all the dick testing\nNow I'm guessing\nShe's laying in a casket\nIn a yellow basket\nFor a Gucci jacket\nDaggit, I wish she didn't do those nasty things\nCause he made the ugly bitch sing\nChorus\nTootie didn't know the facts of life\nStaying up in clinics\nLoosy bootie made trife\nFeeling, she got the heeby geebies\nQuick to give you freebies\nUnderneath the staircase in Brooklyn\nNeighbors out the window sure was lookin\nShe greasy like chicken\nI don't give a cotton pick and\nShe can do her thing\nCause me and her don't hang\nThe ugly bitch sang\nChorus\nSo you know what? This should be a lesson for anybody\nWho's hanging with someone who's dirty, nasty, stank\nOnce again going around humping everybody\nEverybody and anybody and anything\nThat's why you make the ugly

You know what I'm saying? So\nI'mma talk about this one I had a fewa years ago\nI had a friend named Cutie Tootie\nTootie turned tricks to get some Gucci\nKnown as loose bootie\nTruly, she was a freak in the evenin\nAnd if she wasn't teasin, then give me one reason\nWhy she do dat? Always knew dat\nShe was hot as da nectar\nHector said he pecked her, direspected her\nCause he bang bang swang in his dingalang\nBroke his back long range\nAnd make the ugly bitch sing\nOooh oooh\nWhy you hurtin me?\nTell me why more\nOooh oooh\nOooh oooh\nWhy you hurtin me?\nTell me why more\nOooh oooh\nCutie Tootie with her sight\nAnd if she humped Ralph\nShe humped Bobby, Ricky and Mike\nTight, is the way she wore her dresses\nHas she learned her lesson\nFrom all the dick testing\nNow I'm guessing\nShe's laying in a casket\nIn a yellow basket\nFor a Gucci jacket\nDaggit, I wish she didn't do those nasty things\nCause he made the ugly bitch sing\nChorus\nTootie didn't know the facts of life\nStaying up in clinics\nLoosy bootie made trife\nFeeling, she got the heeby geebies\nQuick to give you freebies\nUnderneath the staircase in Brooklyn\nNeighbors out the window sure was lookin\nShe greasy like chicken\nI don't give a cotton pick and\nShe can do her thing\nCause me and her don't hang\nThe ugly bitch sang\nChorus\nSo you know what? This should be a lesson for anybody\nWho's hanging with someone who's dirty, nasty, stank\nOnce again going around humping everybody\nEverybody and anybody and anything\nThat's why you make the ugly bitch sing"}}, {"title": "Work It", "album": "Under Construction", "year": "2002-09-01", "lyrics": "DJ, please pick up your phone, I'm on the request line\nThis is a Missy Elliott one-time exclusive, come on\n\nIs it worth it?

young\nA bunch of girls do it and the shit look fun\nThat's how they do it where we from\nYou know it don't start till one\nThat's how they do it where they from\n\nI'm so faded, no exaggeration\nBacks breakin' like a percolation\nBoys to the yard for some hip spankin'\nWhere you make it drop down like you in the matrix\nCan't take it, them chicks been fakin'\nY'all still sleep, better stay awakened\nHot new dance for the hood to make it\nMake the donk move fast, make them think you drinkin'\nHead to the floor don't collect that though\nYou better huddle up cause the beat's so cold\nPop that, pop that, cock and reload\nThis another hit, I got an ace in the hole\nBoys on my back, playa did you peep that?\nYou got a small stack, playa, you can keep that\nI'm a Big Mac make you wanna eat that\nLike m-m-m-m-m, yak it to the yak\nJunk in the trunk make you pumps in the bump\nGirls wanna have fun make you stickin' out your tongue\n\nThe dance that you doing is dumb\nHow they do it where you from?\nStickin' out your tongue girl\nBut you know you're too young\nA bunch of girls do it and the shit look fun\nThat's how they do it where we from\nYou know it don't start till one\nThat's how they do it where they from\n\nI come into this bitch like liquid\nDrip, drip, then the business\nClick, click, get your picture\nHerm\u00e9s Trismegistus\nWitness and get lifted\nBasic, nigga I was born in the basement\nShape shift, nigga I think like a spaceship\nFalse, oh-nah-nah-nah\nI am so different than y'all, so far apart\nThe way that I balance the bars\nI never fall, and if I do I just call\nThe almighty yellow star, God\nLyrically I'm Optimus Prime\nThe car I drive, look far I ride\nWhen I go by, smoke in your eyes\nSo open your eyes, the joke's on you guys\nAnd you ain't gotta be a mason to see through\nSome of this shit on occasion\n\nThe dance that you doing is dumb\nHow they do it where you from?\nStickin' out your tongue girl\nBut you know you're too young\nA bunch of girls do it and the shit look fun\nThat's how they do it where we from\nYou know it don't start till one\nThat's how they do it where they from\n\nI'm like kak-a-rak-a-rak-rak-a-rak-a-rak\nMake a new track, make 'em fall on they crack\nGive 'em a slap, appetizer and smack\nI'm so fat in the back, make the boys all collapse\nYeah when I rap they be all on my jack\nBoys wanna jump on this pussy cat\nGot a new idea, let me switch it\nMan, I'm so futuristic\nBig lips and big, big, big hips\nBody be thick like a biscuit\nDifferent, rippin' shit, microphone grippin' it\nGettin' these Benjamins, new car, whippin' it\nUh, I'm so far ahead of ya'll, man I'm on top of the stars\nI don't care none of you are, blah-blah-blah-blah\nYou best to go rewrite your bars\n\nShawty what?\nHow they do it where you from? (Triflin'!)\nHow they do it where you from?\nThat's how they do it where we from\nThat's how they do it where they from\nShawty what?\nHow they do it where you from?

tell you think you know me well\nBut you don't know me\nNo you don't know the one who dreams of you at night\nAnd longs to kiss your lips and longs to hold you tight\nTo you I'm just a friend that's all i've ever been\nNo you don't know me\nFor I never knew the art of making love\nThough my heart aches with love for you\nAfraid and shy I let my chance go by\nThe chance you might have loved me too\nYou give your hand to me and then you say good bye\nI watch you walk away beside the lucky guy\nTo never never know the one who loves you so\nNo you don't know me\n(Music Break)\nYou give your hand to me and then you say good bye\nI watch you walk away beside the lucky guy\nTo never never know the one who loves you so\nNo you don't know me"}}], "artist": "Missy Elliott"}
