but you gon' leave what's mine\nI'd rather die, than go home\nI'd rather die, than go home\nAnd I ain't leaving without my 40 acres\n\nUnpolished, unapologetic\nThis cocaine cowboy pushed it to the limit\nYou thought Tony in that cell would've made us timid\nWe found his old cell, bitch, we searchin' through the digits\nAnything Spanish, got me speaking Spanglish\nMoney's universal, that's the only language\nThe dream ain't die, only some real niggas\nWe was born to mothers who couldn't deal with us\nLeft by fathers who wouldn't build with us\nI had both mine home, let's keep it real, niggas\nMy better half chose the better path, applaud him\nYounger brother me a spoiled child, I fought him\nI heard that the Devil's new playground is boredom\nThe California top just falls back like autumn\nAnd they say I'm on the verge of winning\nI claim victory when Malice on the verge of sinning\nOld habits die hard, that rainy day bag buried in the backyard\nIt's heaven for a hustler, no graveyards\n'Cause stand-up niggas don't lie on no floors\nMuch rather burn us, ashes to ashes\nMix us with the powder, sell us to the masses\nWe gon' keep it tight, rip it off the plastic\nNow you celebrate, motherfuckers, raise your glasses\nPush...\n\nTrouble world, trouble child\nTrouble times destroyed my smile\nNo change of heart, no change of mind\nYou can take what's yours but you gon' leave what's mine\nI'd rather die, than go home\nI'd rather die, than go home\nAnd I ain't leaving without my 40 acres\n\nUnpolished, unapologetic\nMight have broke a heart or two but gave an honest effort\nMy nonchalant attitude is always 'F it'\nThirty-five years of marriage and my momma left it\nYou shouldn't question if you ever stood a chance with him\nThe better question is, did you enjoy the dance with him>\n(Yughh!) I'll probably never pull you chair out, bitch\nYou know this money grew your hair out, switch\nAll that shit I bought you wear out\nRich, and I'm the only one I care about\nPlace none above me, God don't like ugly\nHate me or love me, only he can judge me\nUnpolished, unapologetic\nBig willie with the blow, niggas, I am legend\nSchool of hard knock, I attended\nSelling hard rock, fuck who I offended\nI was a goner, punished by karma\nCalled him tar baby, now he\u2019s transcending genres\nThe 911 came with the ass shots\nA toothless crackhead was the mascot\nThe owner of the key to that padlock\nI\u2019m Jordan versus Cavs for the last shot\nI need all mine, reparations\nWe growin' poppy seeds on my 40 acres\nPush!\n\nTrouble world, trouble child\nTrouble times destroyed my smile\nNo change of heart, no change of mind\nYou can take what's yours but you gon' leave what's mine\nI'd rather die, than go home\nI'd rather die, than go home\nAnd I ain't leaving without my 40 acres", "image": "https://images.genius.com/324abe3d1e81bc03ab9ad30ec3137e50.500x500x1.jpg", "artist": "Pusha-T", "raw": {"annotation_count": 35, "api_path": "/songs/218134", "description": {"dom": {"tag": "root", "children": [{"tag": "p", "children": ["?"]}]}}, "embed_content": "<div id='rg_embed_link_218134' class='rg_embed_link' data-song-id='218134'>Read <a href='https://genius.com/Pusha-t-40-acres-lyrics'>\u201c40 Acres\u201d by Pusha-T</a> on Genius</div> <script crossorigin src='//genius.com/songs/218134/embed.js'></script>", "fact_track": {"provider": "spotify", "external_url": "https://open.spotify.com/track/5mDwWTLqgYYkUZILLcZlFN", "button_text": "Behind the Lyrics in Spotify", "help_link_text": "What's a Fact Track?", "help_link_url": "https://genius.com/a/genius-and-spotify-together"}, "featured_video": false, "full_title": "40 Acres by\u00a0Pusha-T (Ft.\u00a0The-Dream)", "header_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/324abe3d1e81bc03ab9ad30ec3137e50.300x300x1.jpg", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/324abe3d1e81bc03ab9ad30ec3137e50.500x500x1.jpg", "id": 218134, "lyrics_owner_id": 149650, "lyrics_state": "complete", "path": "/Pusha-t-40-acres-lyrics", "pyongs_count": 35, "recording_location": "Setai Studios, Miami Beach, FL", "release_date": "2013-10-07", "song_art_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/324abe3d1e81bc03ab9ad30ec3137e50.300x300x1.jpg", "song_art_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/324abe3d1e81bc03ab9ad30ec3137e50.500x500x1.jpg", "stats": {"accepted_annotations": 27, "contributors": 72, "hot": false, "iq_earners": 70, "transcribers": 3, "unreviewed_annotations": 2, "verified_annotations": 6, "pageviews": 181308}, "title": "40 Acres", "title_with_featured": "40 Acres (Ft.\u00a0The-Dream)", "url": "https://genius.com/Pusha-t-40-acres-lyrics", "current_user_metadata": {"permissions": ["see_pageviews", "watch_fact_track", "create_comment", "view_song_story_gallery"], "excluded_permissions": ["follow", "award_transcription_iq", "remove_transcription_iq", "pyong", "edit_lyrics", "view_annotation_engagement_data", "publish", "unpublish", "edit_spotify_details", "hide", "unhide", "toggle_featured_video", "add_pinned_annotation_to", "add_community_annotation_to", "destroy", "mark_as_not_spam", "edit_spotify_annotations_for", "verify_lyrics", "unverify_lyrics", "edit_anything", "edit_album_appearances", "edit_any_media", "edit", "rename", "edit_tags", "reindex", "view_lyrics_synchronization", "enable_media", "disable_media", "edit_lyrics_or_annotation_brackets", "see_editorial_indicators", "view_attribution_visualization", "edit_youtube_url", "edit_soundcloud_url", "edit_spotify_uuid", "edit_apple_music_url", "edit_vevo_url", "moderate_annotations", "create_annotation", "see_short_id", "manage_chart_item", "create_tag", "propose_lyrics_edit", "moderate_lyrics_edit_proposals"], "interactions": {"pyong": false, "following": false}, "relationships": {}, "iq_by_action": {}}, "album": {"api_path": "/albums/22349", "cover_art_url": "https://images.genius.com/324abe3d1e81bc03ab9ad30ec3137e50.500x500x1.jpg", "full_title": "My Name Is My Name by Pusha-T", "id": 22349, "name": "My Name Is My Name", "url": "https://genius.com/albums/Pusha-t/My-name-is-my-name", "artist": {"api_path": "/artists/643", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/1bc34e5deca22b440c5d186ef06720f2.1000x668x1.jpg", "id": 643, "image_url": "https://images.genius.com/87903651ddee503eda9f6cb78c37e662.400x400x1.jpg", "is_meme_verified": true, "is_verified": true, "name": "Pusha-T", "url": "https://genius.com/artists/Pusha-t", "iq": 44521}}, "custom_performances": [{"label": "Label", "artists": [{"api_path": "/artists/213768", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/299224af186138eff34848f0c12e80df.617x617x1.jpg", "id": 213768, "image_url": "https://images.genius.com/299224af186138eff34848f0c12e80df.617x617x1.jpg", "is_meme_verified": false, "is_verified": false, "name": "G.O.O.D.

die, than go home\nI'd rather die, than go home\nAnd I ain't leaving without my 40 acres\n\nUnpolished, unapologetic\nThis cocaine cowboy pushed it to the limit\nYou thought Tony in that cell would've made us timid\nWe found his old cell, bitch, we searchin' through the digits\nAnything Spanish, got me speaking Spanglish\nMoney's universal, that's the only language\nThe dream ain't die, only some real niggas\nWe was born to mothers who couldn't deal with us\nLeft by fathers who wouldn't build with us\nI had both mine home, let's keep it real, niggas\nMy better half chose the better path, applaud him\nYounger brother me a spoiled child, I fought him\nI heard that the Devil's new playground is boredom\nThe California top just falls back like autumn\nAnd they say I'm on the verge of winning\nI claim victory when Malice on the verge of sinning\nOld habits die hard, that rainy day bag buried in the backyard\nIt's heaven for a hustler, no graveyards\n'Cause stand-up niggas don't lie on no floors\nMuch rather burn us, ashes to ashes\nMix us with the powder, sell us to the masses\nWe gon' keep it tight, rip it off the plastic\nNow you celebrate, motherfuckers, raise your glasses\nPush...\n\nTrouble world, trouble child\nTrouble times destroyed my smile\nNo change of heart, no change of mind\nYou can take what's yours but you gon' leave what's mine\nI'd rather die, than go home\nI'd rather die, than go home\nAnd I ain't leaving without my 40 acres\n\nUnpolished, unapologetic\nMight have broke a heart or two but gave an honest effort\nMy nonchalant attitude is always 'F it'\nThirty-five years of marriage and my momma left it\nYou shouldn't question if you ever stood a chance with him\nThe better question is, did you enjoy the dance with him>\n(Yughh!) I'll probably never pull you chair out, bitch\nYou know this money grew your hair out, switch\nAll that shit I bought you wear out\nRich, and I'm the only one I care about\nPlace none above me, God don't like ugly\nHate me or love me, only he can judge me\nUnpolished, unapologetic\nBig willie with the blow, niggas, I am legend\nSchool of hard knock, I attended\nSelling hard rock, fuck who I offended\nI was a goner, punished by karma\nCalled him tar baby, now he\u2019s transcending genres\nThe 911 came with the ass shots\nA toothless crackhead was the mascot\nThe owner of the key to that padlock\nI\u2019m Jordan versus Cavs for the last shot\nI need all mine, reparations\nWe growin' poppy seeds on my 40 acres\nPush!\n\nTrouble world, trouble child\nTrouble times destroyed my smile\nNo change of heart, no change of mind\nYou can take what's yours but you gon' leave what's mine\nI'd rather die, than go home\nI'd rather die, than go home\nAnd I ain't leaving without my 40 acres"}},

dealer dichotomy\nI'm drawing from both sides, I am Siamese\nThe tug of war opens the door, entrada\nRip me apart and see what's inside of this pi\u00f1ata\nAnd rolling kilos in Gymstrada that's one saga\nOne chapter of black magic, I'm Harold Potter\nFeels like I'm doomed to dealing with women who\nRelationships with their fathers won't allow us to bloom\nAnd blossom, I swear them Vegas nights was fucking awesome\nBut adi\u00f3s I blow my own dice before I toss 'em\nLost some niggas some other niggas double crossed 'em\nTryna snatch my niggas back I blew a small fortune\nWrestle with the work, we was like the four horsemen\nRick Flair with the flame, I'm motherfucking Gorgeous\nAs the gull wing doors lift\nKarate Kid, crane kick, no Jaden Smith\nWhiter than that coke brush that they paint me with\nSunk leather seats softer than an angel's kiss\nBut they devil red, tires double tread\nI post and parks up, that gets me double head\nTight rope walking tryna keep a level head\nThe bright lights blind look at what the devil did\n\nShe left the door open gave a fuck if I'm famous\nI write this alone in Vegas\nCame off fly street money partied nights with the a-list\nI write this alone in Vegas\nRemember nights when my team blew it all on the tables\nI write this alone in Vegas\nI'm the only one left and the memories fading so\nI write this alone in Vegas\n\nThey'll do everything in their power\nStomp near the stove when you're rising like flour\nMake your cake fall when you threatening their tower\nIt's 911 you're on your 25th hour\nHasta la vista I'm steppin' out the bleachers\nHow the tide turns when the pupil's now the teacher\nThe game can't grow by just followin' the leaders\nYou gotta be better than the ones who precede, yeah\nUpgrade them, upstage them\nChange the whole body shape and just update them, Pagans\nReagan era I ran contraband\nMoney caused turf wars through the promised land\nFirst time being rich could be a common man\nThe Guy Fishers had the blueprints and diagrams\nWe just took what we needed and we built on it\nLord forgive me for the blood that I spilt on it\n\nShe left the door open gave a fuck if I'm famous\nI write this alone in Vegas\nCame off fly street money partied nights with the a-list\nI write this alone in Vegas\nRemember nights when my team blew it all on the tables\nI write this alone in Vegas\nI'm the only one left and the memories fading so\nI write this alone in Vegas\n\nFear of God niggas, got me feelin' like Pac\nThis the realest shit I ever wrote\nWho you know sit in New York for 2 days around Grammy winners\nCome back home straight to the money getters\nAbout $14,000 dollars worth in 20s\nBrown paper bag money, I call that a good weekend\nRe-up gang forever\nLong live the caine coming soon\nMalice my brother I love you\nLiva Don 'til the end nigga", "image": "https://images.genius.com/262a2d9a193fe0dd97acc8982aa8c6e9.500x500x1.jpg", "artist": "Pusha-T", "raw": {"annotation_count":

I'm doomed to dealing with women who\nRelationships with their fathers won't allow us to bloom\nAnd blossom, I swear them Vegas nights was fucking awesome\nBut adi\u00f3s I blow my own dice before I toss 'em\nLost some niggas some other niggas double crossed 'em\nTryna snatch my niggas back I blew a small fortune\nWrestle with the work, we was like the four horsemen\nRick Flair with the flame, I'm motherfucking Gorgeous\nAs the gull wing doors lift\nKarate Kid, crane kick, no Jaden Smith\nWhiter than that coke brush that they paint me with\nSunk leather seats softer than an angel's kiss\nBut they devil red, tires double tread\nI post and parks up, that gets me double head\nTight rope walking tryna keep a level head\nThe bright lights blind look at what the devil did\n\nShe left the door open gave a fuck if I'm famous\nI write this alone in Vegas\nCame off fly street money partied nights with the a-list\nI write this alone in Vegas\nRemember nights when my team blew it all on

like flour\nMake your cake fall when you threatening their tower\nIt's 911 you're on your 25th hour\nHasta la vista I'm steppin' out the bleachers\nHow the tide turns when the pupil's now the teacher\nThe game can't grow by just followin' the leaders\nYou gotta be better than the ones who precede, yeah\nUpgrade them, upstage them\nChange the whole body shape and just update them, Pagans\nReagan era I ran contraband\nMoney caused turf wars through the promised land\nFirst time being rich could be a common man\nThe Guy Fishers had the blueprints and diagrams\nWe just took what we needed and we built on it\nLord forgive me for the blood that I spilt on it\n\nShe left the door open gave a fuck if I'm famous\nI write this alone in Vegas\nCame off fly street money partied

as she walking through my morgue\nGrants, Jacksons, no room for George\nYeh, the fear of God\u2019s in you muthafuckas\nThis art imitate my life\nYour World Star Hip Hop fame based off imitation white\nEliminate the fool's gold and imitation ice\nMy music for your soul, inspiration for your life\nEvery dime I made in this life wasn't disastrous\nHelp my young bitch see my way through the Bachelors\nSent my old bitch right back to get her Masters\nSame graduation I was clapping in the rafters\nThe truth hurts everytime it\u2019s revealed\nWhat goes around comes around, this is life's ferris wheel\nGrab hold and reverse the steering wheel\nAs I parrallel park, Kentucky Derby on the grill\nThe fact that I\u2019m free lets me know God is great\nTen year marathon of me selling concentrate\nThese rappers talk crowns but I\u2019d rather talk fear\nVillain like Candyman, say my name and I\u2019ll appear\nNo weapon formed against me shall prosper\nHakuna matata, feet up sipping java\nStrolling up the totem poll, what\u2019s my only problem?\nScrolling through my Rolodex, who shall bear my toddler\nSo many hands raised as the band plays\nI\u2019m here now, watch how many nigga's plans change\nFirst class flights, Ciroc soaked nights\nWaking up to models, what a motherfuckin life", "image": "https://images.genius.com/262a2d9a193fe0dd97acc8982aa8c6e9.500x500x1.jpg",

Autumn\nAll of them fallin' for the love of ballin'\nGot caught with 30 rocks, the cop look like Alec Baldwin\nInter century anthems based off inner city tantrums\nBased off the way we was branded\nFace it, Jerome get more time than Brandon\nAnd at the airport they check all through my bag\nAnd tell me that it's random\nBut we stay winning, this week has been a bad massage\nI need a happy ending and a new beginning\nAnd a new fitted and some job opportunities that's lucrative\nThis the real world, homie, school finished\nThey done stole your dreams, you dunno who did it\nI treat the cash the way the government treats AIDS\nI won't be satisfied til all my niggas get it, get it?\nI need more drinks and less lights\nAnd that American Apparel girl in just tights\nShe told the director she tryna get in a school\nHe said \"take them glasses off and get in the pool\"\nIt's been a while since I watched the tube\nCause like a crip said, \"I got way too many blues for any more bad news\"\nI was looking at my resume feeling real fresh today\nThey rewrite history I don't believe in yesterday\nAnd what's a black Beatle anyway, a f*cking roach?\nI guess that's why they got me sitting in f*cking coach\nMy guy said I need a different approach\nCause people is looking at me like I'm sniffing coke\nIt ain't funny anymore try different jokes\nTell 'em hug and kiss my ass, X and O\nKiss the ring while they at it, do my thing while I got it\nPlay strings for the dramatic\nAnd end all of that wack shit\nAct like I ain't had a belt in two classes\nI ain't got it I'm going after whoever who has it\nI'm coming after whoever. Who has it?\nYou blowing up, that's good, fantastic\nThat y'all, it's like that ya'll\nI don't really give a f*ck about it at all\nCause the same people that tried to black ball me\nForgot about two things, my black balls\nUh, look, Uh uh\nI let you into my diary to admire me\nThe making of this man, I let you see the higher me\nThe self righteous drug dealer dichotomy\nI'm drawn from both sides, I am Siamese\nThe tug-of-war opens the door, entrada\nRip me apart and see what's inside of this pi\u00f1ata\nAnd rolling kilos in Gymstrada, that's one saga\nOne chapter of black magic, I'm Harry Potter\nFeels like I'm doomed to dealing with women who\nRelationships with their fathers won't allow us to bloom\nAnd blossom, I swear this Vegas night was f*cking awesome\nBut adios, I blow my own dice before I toss 'em\nLoss some niggas, some other niggas double-crossed 'em\nTryna snatch my niggas back I blew a small fortune\nWrestle with the work, we was like the four horsemen\nRick Flair with the flame, I'm muthaf*cking gorgeous, woah\nAs the gull wing doors lift, Karate Kid, crane kick, no Jaden Smith\nWhiter than that coke brush did they paint me with\nSunk leather seats softer than an angels kiss\nBut they devil-red, tires double tread\nI postin parks up, that gives me double head\nTight rope walking, tryna keep a level head\nThe bright lights blind, look at what the devil did\nYuugh!", "image": "https://images.genius.com/87903651ddee503eda9f6cb78c37e662.400x400x1.jpg", "artist": "Pusha-T", "raw": {"annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/1120871", "description":

view got me channeling my vision\nTurn one to two now the kilo's got a sibling\nFather knows best, wash my hands, all's forgiven\nWe kicking up dust like the Colosseum floors\nWalls full of safe's like they mausoleum doors\nPussy getting wet like she walking through my morgue\nGrant's, Jackson's, no room for George\nYeah, the fear of God's in you motherf*ckers\nThis art imitate my life\nYour WorldStarHipHop fame based off imitation white\nEliminate the fools ghouling imitation ice\nMy music's for your soul, inspiration for your life\nEvery dime made in his life more disastrous\nHelp my young bitch see her way through her bachelors\nWhile my old bitch went back to get her Masters\nSame graduation, I was clapping in the rafters\nThe truth hurts every time it's revealed\nWhat goes around comes around, this is life's Ferris wheel\nGrab hold and reverse the steering wheel as I parallel park\nKentucky derby on the grill\nThe fact that I'm free let's me know God is great\nTen year marathon of me selling concentrate\nThese rappers talk crowns but I'd rather talk fear\nVillain like Candyman, say my name and I'll appear\nNo weapon formed against me shall prosper\nHakuna matata, feet up, sipping java\nEy yo, strolling up the totem pole, what's my only problem?\nScrolling through my Rolodex, who shall bed my toddler?\nSo many hands raised as the band plays\nI'm here now, watch how many niggas plans change\nAnd eventually answers to the call of Autumn\nAll of them fallin' for the love of ballin'\nGot caught with 30 rocks, the cop look like Alec Baldwin\nInter century anthems based off inner city tantrums\nBased off the way we was branded\nFace it, Jerome get more time than Brandon\nAnd at the airport they check all through my bag\nAnd tell me that it's random\nBut we stay winning, this week has been a bad massage\nI need a happy ending and a new beginning\nAnd a new fitted and some job opportunities that's lucrative\nThis the real world, homie, school finished\nThey done stole your dreams, you dunno who did it\nI treat the cash the way the government treats AIDS\nI won't be satisfied til all my niggas get it, get it?\nI need more drinks and less lights\nAnd that American Apparel girl in just tights\nShe told the director she tryna get in a school\nHe said \"take them glasses off and get in the pool\"\nIt's been a while since I watched the tube\nCause like a crip said, \"I got way too many blues for any more bad news\"\nI was looking at my resume feeling real fresh today\nThey rewrite history I don't believe in yesterday\nAnd what's a black Beatle anyway, a f*cking roach?\nI guess that's why they got me sitting in f*cking coach\nMy guy said I need a different approach\nCause people is looking at me like I'm sniffing coke\nIt ain't funny anymore try different jokes\nTell 'em hug and kiss my ass, X and O\nKiss the ring while they at it, do my thing while I got it\nPlay strings for the dramatic\nAnd end all of that wack shit\nAct like I ain't had a belt in two classes\nI ain't got it I'm going after whoever who has it\nI'm coming after whoever. Who has it?\nYou blowing up, that's good, fantastic\nThat y'all, it's like that ya'll\nI don't really give a f*ck about it at all\nCause the same people that tried to black ball me\nForgot about two things, my black balls\nUh, look, Uh uh\nI let you into my diary to admire me\nThe making of this man, I let you see the higher me\nThe self righteous drug dealer dichotomy\nI'm drawn from both sides, I am Siamese\nThe tug-of-war opens the door, entrada\nRip me apart and see what's inside of this pi\u00f1ata\nAnd rolling kilos in Gymstrada, that's one saga\nOne chapter of black magic, I'm Harry Potter\nFeels like I'm doomed to dealing with women who\nRelationships with their fathers won't allow us to bloom\nAnd blossom, I swear this Vegas night was f*cking awesome\nBut adios, I blow my own dice before I toss 'em\nLoss some niggas, some other niggas double-crossed 'em\nTryna snatch my niggas back I blew a small fortune\nWrestle with the work, we was like the four horsemen\nRick Flair with the flame, I'm muthaf*cking gorgeous, woah\nAs the gull wing doors lift, Karate Kid, crane kick, no Jaden Smith\nWhiter than that coke brush did they paint me with\nSunk leather seats softer than an angels kiss\nBut they devil-red, tires double tread\nI postin parks up, that gives me double head\nTight rope walking, tryna keep a level head\nThe bright lights blind, look at what the devil did\nYuugh!"}}, {"title": "Bodega Babies*", "album": null, "year": null, "lyrics": "Snippets from the Pusha T x ADIDAS collaboration \"Bodega Babies\"\nBlack child born in the storm\nThey had to

hundred, you\u2019re thirty-two percent\nThe police got you on a leash, nigga you a bitch\n\nGive yo' ass that body work nigga we spraying\nRidin' with three K's nigga I ain't talking bout the Klan\nThis ain\u2019t no arcade, nigga so quit playing\nIt\u2019s eating time, me and my niggas buffeting\nGive yo' ass that body work, nigga we spraying\nRidin' with three K's nigga I ain't talking bout the Klan\nThis ain\u2019t no arcade, nigga so quit playing!\nIt\u2019s eating time, me and my niggas buffeting\n\nYou don\u2019t know about this life, nigga\nEarning all of these stripes, nigga\nKilograms, Peter Pans\nPack holders on bikes, nigga\nThrowin bitches on flights, nigga\nThey ain't know that they're dykes, nigga\n'Til the money\u2019s out and the bottle's pouring\nThey\u2019re in the midst of they life, nigga\nRose gold on my wrist, this Rolex like Devil's piss\nThis Daytona illuminate, y'all think I'm talking that devil shit\nThis's fifty racks, no bezel shit\nLike blood diamonds, it\u2019s rebel shit\nThis more guns, this more bodies\nWe call shots, they nobodies\nThey fuck niggas, they owe prolly\nWho's fuckin with me? Nobody\nWhen the guns drawn, they\u2019re so sorry\nSpraying niggas now the Lord got 'em\nBullets out the barrel make your body jerk\nFuck with my money and I\u2019ll hit you that body work\n\n\nBad bitches on deck, nigga\nMoney, power, respect, nigga\nCop, cook, collect, nigga\nYou was never no threat, nigga\nEverybody be rap dissin'\nI catch niggas, I check niggas\nThese goons with me don't

on the camera, Virgil what up\n\nThey say this took confidence, I just call it patience\nCause I had too much pride to take this motherfucking cadence\nKnowing the Feds watch me, private paparazzi\nStill chasing me for war crimes like a Nazi\nAgainst all odds, see the judge tryna' Pac me\nLucky dice roll got my lawyers screaming, Yahtzee\nWho the fuck can stop me run away freight train\nMike Vick's redemption, big doggin like a great dane\n12 cylinders 50 grams of willing ya\nThese rappers get away with pushing these child Illingers\nNow it's hard feelings, I just put my ceiling up\nPlanetarium Push, the I-Max experience\nThey say I talk coke for 9 years long\nThat means my rap sheet is more than 9 years strong\nYou niggas would have thought that I was 9 years gone\nBut I am still in the mix like 9 ounces and a straw\nNigga get your bag on, bitch get your bag on\nBalenciaga Hobo so heavy that you drag home\nYeah, see my verses let you tag along\nSwim in the oasis of this drug dealers Babylon\nThree bitches, three different flights\nGlad it was four sides at that Paul Williams fight\nThe Wynn, the Bellagio, the Palms three nights\nAs long as they are separated they are my three blind mice\nYou can't just rap this, the same mindset\nThat had me hide it in the mattress, now got me round the atlas\nWish every doughboy could get a fair crack at this\nThey say when one ends, that begins a new chapter\n\nCan I live\nYou tell me, can I live", "image": "https://images.genius.com/262a2d9a193fe0dd97acc8982aa8c6e9.500x500x1.jpg", "artist":

the Fear of God\nLiva Don, Noah on the boards, Steven Victor on the camera, Virgil what up\n\nThey say this took confidence, I just call it patience\nCause I had too much pride to take this motherfucking cadence\nKnowing the Feds watch me, private paparazzi\nStill chasing me for war crimes like a Nazi\nAgainst all odds, see the judge tryna' Pac me\nLucky dice roll got my lawyers screaming, Yahtzee\nWho the fuck can stop me run away freight train\nMike Vick's redemption, big doggin like a great dane\n12 cylinders 50 grams of willing ya\nThese rappers get away with pushing these child Illingers\nNow it's hard feelings, I just put my ceiling up\nPlanetarium Push, the I-Max experience\nThey say I talk coke for 9 years long\nThat means my rap sheet is more than 9 years strong\nYou niggas would have thought that I was 9 years gone\nBut I am still in the mix like 9 ounces and a straw\nNigga get your bag on, bitch get your bag on\nBalenciaga Hobo so heavy that you drag home\nYeah, see my verses let you tag along\nSwim in the oasis of this drug dealers Babylon\nThree bitches, three different flights\nGlad it was four sides at that Paul Williams fight\nThe Wynn, the Bellagio, the Palms three nights\nAs long as they are separated they are my three blind mice\nYou can't just rap this, the same mindset\nThat had me hide it in the mattress, now got me round the atlas\nWish every doughboy could get a fair crack at this\nThey say when one ends, that begins a new chapter\n\nCan I live\nYou tell me, can I live"}}, {"title": "Changing of the Guards", "album":

kings\nGoliath ain't worried 'bout your sling\nAnd Cassius ain't bothered by your swings\nYou niggas keep rappin' 'bout your dreams, my reality\n50 birds waitin' in the wings\nDo it my way, I hit the highway with the batter\nSo when Kanye go on his hia', it don't matter\nSince you talking 'bout me, then let's talk about this money\nLet's talk about the cars and why mines shaped funny\nLets' talk about the fact you'll never take nothin' from me\nLets talk about the fact you niggas hate I'm up and runnin'\nRG3 nigga, be that\nRunnin' through this money and these white women\nSpike Lee see that\nShe gotta have it and I gotta give it\nAnd you do not relate cause you niggas do not live it, no\n\n\nAttention seekers beware, I will grant wishes\nWe can take this so much further than your mentions\nI can get your eulogy on YouTube for instance\nHave the whole world view the body\nSince y'all claim I'm Illuminati, tell me why would you try me?\nKennedy, John F., or Bobby\nAlmost caught Reagan, but they stopped us at the lobby\nAnd that was broad day, so how the fuck you gon' stop me?\nYou lil' niggas just dirty mine's is Zero Dark Thirty\nMine is night vision, witch huntin', ride for Pac worthy\nI'm coke boy leanin' on you niggas\nIf money talk then I must be screamin' on you niggas\nTop of the pile I was two thirds away\nI was sidetracked busy selling two birds a day, God\nDeath is just a U-turn away\nTwo men ten paces then you turn and spray\n x2\n\nMy Name is my name!"}}, {"title": "Don't Fuck With Me", "album": null, "year": "2011-09-26", "lyrics": "Re-up gang,

Trey up on your hook, still couldn't save 'em\nBetter chance with a snowball hittin' Satan\nDreams money can buy, three racks just spent on my Marty McFlys\nNow I'm back to the future, my career deja-vu you\nWhen you muthaf*ckers thought I would barely survive\nRappers on their sophomores, actin' like they boss lords\nFame's such a funny thing for sure\nWhen n*ggas start believing all those encores\nI'm just the one to send you off, bonjour\nSee yourself as I pull up in that mirror tint\nSkins vs blouses, you mirror Prince\nChappelle Show, all of your Neal Brennans\nSketch comedy, who is for real penning?\nThe talk don't match the leather\nThe swag don't match the sweaters\nAnd wolves don't walk with shepherds\nThese Margiela verses all of you mall dwellers\nOff-the-rack suits looking like pallbearers\nCoffins for my old b*tches' orphans\nDaddy's MIA like a dolphin\nPlay the Fendi bucket like a sharks fin\nCool J-ing on you b*tches but I'm dark-skinned\nWe walked in, seats courtside, dap Diddy, Will Ferrell on my walk by\nAt the US Open, there's much more to Queens\nVersace blu-blockers, row behind Oracene\nDreams money can buy, three racks just spent on my Marty McFlys\nNow I'm back to the future, my career deja-vu you\nWhen you muthaf*ckers thought I would hardly survive\nPush, no shots, but nothing goes unseen", "image":

ghosts and goblins\nBlonde mohawk the collection I\u2019m Dennis Rodman\nThe money count is the only moment of silence\nCause hush money balances all this drugs and violence\nHat trick under my mattress\nDate I stop still has an asterisk after it\nAfter all I can make a call\nI can baptize a brick\nAs I wash away my sins like a catholic\nWho the fuck ain't mastered this\nAmerica\u2019s nightmare's in Flint\nChildren of a lesser God when your melanin\u2019s got a tint\nAnd I can\u2019t even mention what I sent or what I spent\nCause my name in 18 wheelers is evidence\nI put my boos in those cruise collections\nLife\u2019s a bitch\nA to Z on her shoe collection, take your pick\nPaid in full like \u201986, Gs on my body\nThe new Gucci has less monograms, God\u2019s got him\nLet he without sin cast the first stone\nSo I built that all glass quad level first home\nShatter all of your misconceptions\nHold all of them missing weapons\nYou thought I would miss my blessing\nThe ultimate misdirection ya\n\nYour husband was drug dealer\nFor 14 years he sold crack cocaine\n\nFederico Fellini in the flesh\nSergio Tacchini inside his mesh\nBitch I been brackin\u2019 since the

accountant\nHe been hula hooping through loop holes, working around shit\nIRS should\u2019ve had the townhouses surrounded\nThanks to the lawyers\nI marbled the foyer\nI tore the floor up\nYeah, that\u2019s for the Koi fish\nWe been dining on oysters\nI walk though the garage it\u2019s like multiple choices\nI told \u2018em pull the Royce up\nI\u2019m getting ghost, I\u2019m hearing noises\nI think it\u2019s the boys, but I been banking at Deutsche\nWe got storefronts, we got employee stubs\nWe been opening studios and 40/40s up\nThe paper trail is gorgeous\nCases we buries \u2018em\nBefore Reasonable Doubt dropped, the jury hung\nBling bling\nEvery time I come around your city bling bling\nMy tenure took me through Virginia\nAsk Teddy Riley \u2018bout me\nAsk the

it\u2019s ominous\nGarages, the phantom, ghouls, ghosts and goblins\nBlonde mohawk the collection I\u2019m Dennis Rodman\nThe money count is the only moment of silence\nCause hush money balances all this drugs and violence\nHat trick under my mattress\nDate I stop still has an asterisk after it\nAfter all I can make a call\nI can baptize a brick\nAs I wash away my sins like a catholic\nWho the fuck ain't mastered this\nAmerica\u2019s nightmare's in Flint\nChildren of a lesser God when your melanin\u2019s got a tint\nAnd I can\u2019t even mention what I sent or what I spent\nCause my name in 18 wheelers is evidence\nI put my boos in those cruise collections\nLife\u2019s a bitch\nA to Z on her shoe collection, take your pick\nPaid in full like \u201986, Gs on my body\nThe new Gucci has less monograms, God\u2019s got him\nLet he without sin cast the first stone\nSo I built that all glass quad level first home\nShatter all of your misconceptions\nHold all of them missing weapons\nYou thought I would miss my blessing\nThe ultimate misdirection ya\n\nYour husband was drug dealer\nFor 14 years he sold crack cocaine\n\nFederico Fellini in the flesh\nSergio Tacchini inside his mesh\nBitch I been brackin\u2019 since the \u201880s\nGoogle me baby, you crazy\n\u201989 in London pull the Benz up\nType it in, Google\u2019s your friend bruh\n14-year drug dealer and still counting\nWho deserves the medal of freedom is my accountant\nHe been hula hooping through loop holes, working around shit\nIRS should\u2019ve had the townhouses surrounded\nThanks to the lawyers\nI marbled the foyer\nI tore the floor up\nYeah, that\u2019s for the Koi fish\nWe been dining on oysters\nI walk though the garage it\u2019s like multiple choices\nI told \u2018em pull the Royce up\nI\u2019m getting ghost, I\u2019m hearing noises\nI think it\u2019s the boys, but I been banking at Deutsche\nWe got storefronts, we got employee stubs\nWe been opening studios and 40/40s up\nThe paper trail is gorgeous\nCases we buries \u2018em\nBefore Reasonable Doubt dropped, the jury hung\nBling bling\nEvery time I come around your city bling bling\nMy tenure took me through Virginia\nAsk Teddy Riley \u2018bout me\nAsk the Federalis \u2018bout me\nTried to build a cell around me\nSnatched my nigga Emory up\nTried to get him to tell about me\nHe told 12, \u201cGimme 12\u201d\nHe told them to go to hell about me\nDrug dealers anonymous\nY\u2019all think Uber\u2019s the future, our cars been autonomous\nMules move the drums, take \u2018em to different spots\nWe just call the shots by simply moving our thumbs\nI\u2019m a course of miracles with this shit\nNothing real can be threatened, nothing unreal exists\nTherein lies the piece of God\nI always knew I was a prophet, but I couldn\u2019t find a decent job\nLife made me ambidextrous\nCountin\u2019 with my right, whippin\u2019 white with my left wrist\nDaaaaaaaamn Daniel\nFBI keep bringing them all white vans through"}},

everything that glitters, it ain't gold\nI'm gettin' low, hold me from the haters\nCameras in action, tell my niggas what's happenin'\nRolling smoke, getting high, high, high\nJust another day getting by, by, by\n\nFor every brick broke down it's one stepped on\nFor every known rat, it's one slept on\nFor every loyal nigga fronted, one kept owin'\nFor every bitch I showed the way, it's one that kept hoin'\nSo let's blow through this money as we pour bottles\nLet me drop another classic and a tour follows\nLet's get pissy drunk and let the whores swallow\nMy niggas embrace guns and ignore Bibles\nNot to glorify it, you can't ignore the lines\nThe new jury can be you, ghetto law-abiding\nBetter know who that is looking in the mirror\nThe truth lies, and your soul can't see it clearer\n\n\nI just can't leave it alone, I just can't leave it alone\nThey're handing out football numbers after tappin' your phone\nOr you watchin' for the drop as they clappin' they chrome\nTook a brick and I turned it to stone\n5 into 10, the Return of the Clones\nThen I took my experience and turned it to poems\nAs we took single engines and turned 'em to Boeings\nPanamera blood red symbolize bloodshed\nLoss lot of niggas, some in Club Fed\nFew still reminiscin' in they CL\nSelling Pete Rock, cruisin' in they V-12", "image":

know who you is\nWhen you lookin' in the mirror\nCause everything that glitters, it ain't gold\nI'm gettin' low from the hater\nCameras in action, tell all my niggas what's happenin'\nRidin' with my niggas\nCause everything that glitters, it ain't gold\nI'm gettin' low, hold me from the haters\nCameras in action, tell my niggas what's happenin'\nRolling smoke, getting high, high, high\nJust another day getting by, by, by\n\nFor every brick broke down it's one stepped on\nFor every known rat, it's one slept on\nFor every loyal nigga fronted, one kept owin'\nFor every bitch I showed the way, it's one that kept hoin'\nSo let's blow through this money as we pour bottles\nLet me drop another classic and a tour follows\nLet's get pissy drunk and let the whores swallow\nMy niggas embrace guns and ignore Bibles\nNot to glorify it, you can't ignore the lines\nThe new jury can be you, ghetto law-abiding\nBetter know who that is looking in the mirror\nThe truth lies, and your soul can't see it clearer\n\n\nI just can't leave it alone, I just can't leave it alone\nThey're handing out football numbers after tappin' your phone\nOr you watchin' for the drop as they clappin' they chrome\nTook a brick and I turned it to stone\n5 into 10, the Return of the Clones\nThen I took my experience and turned it to poems\nAs we took single engines and turned 'em to Boeings\nPanamera blood red symbolize bloodshed\nLoss lot of niggas, some in Club Fed\nFew still reminiscin' in they CL\nSelling Pete Rock, cruisin' in they V-12"}}, {"title": "Exodus 23:1", "album": null, "year":

all camouflaged\nYou can't hide it from yourselves, career sabotaged\nI was really in that Travelodge\nYou just lying through your catalogues\nWhere the blood and the battle scars\nWe the ones that judge juggling the gavels on\nPut me to the body, nigga\nFirst 48 put us to them bodies, nigga\nRound here we don't play that\nA to the K that, spray that, lay back\nYou can keep your beats, nigga\nWe'd much rather share your bitch, nigga, bitch nigga\n3 million can't hide that\nIt shows in the homes I done tried that\nThat's why you'll never be my neighbors\nSmile as you waving but we know you niggas hate us\nFuck you playing games for\nDon't be scared get everything you came for\nThey got you talking that big shit\nLittle do you know we don't miss shit\nThem niggas using you as a pawn\nYou see they never loaded they guns\nNow you out here all by yourself\nAsk Steve Jobs, wealth don't buy health\n\nBeef is best served like steak: well done\nGet a gun in your face, bitch

is when you hide behind them other niggas\nBut they ain't killers they ain't pullin' them triggers, fuck niggas\nBeef will have you keying our cars\nHeartbroke, yours don't look like ours\n\nThem niggas ain't dying for you\nThem niggas ain't dying for you\nThrowing that flag up running around you hot shit\nTaking half of everything you get\nYeah them niggas ain't dying for you\nThem niggas ain't dying for you\nAnd we know that\n\nContract all fucked up\nI guess that means you all fucked up\nYou signed to one nigga that signed to another nigga\nThat's signed to three niggas, now that's bad luck\nDamn that shit even the odds now\nYou better off selling this hard now\nYou call it living out your dreams\nYou can't fly without your wings\nYou get it\nJeremy Scott's all camouflaged\nYou can't hide it from yourselves, career sabotaged\nI was really in that Travelodge\nYou just lying through your catalogues\nWhere the blood and the battle scars\nWe the ones that judge juggling the gavels on\nPut me to the body, nigga\nFirst 48 put us to them bodies, nigga\nRound here we don't play that\nA to the K that, spray that, lay back\nYou can keep your beats, nigga\nWe'd much rather share your bitch, nigga, bitch nigga\n3 million can't hide that\nIt shows in the homes I done tried that\nThat's why you'll never be my neighbors\nSmile as you waving but we know you niggas hate us\nFuck you playing games for\nDon't be scared get everything you came for\nThey got you talking that big shit\nLittle do you know we don't miss shit\nThem niggas using you as a pawn\nYou see they never loaded they guns\nNow you out here all by yourself\nAsk Steve Jobs, wealth don't buy health\n\nBeef is best served like steak: well done\nGet a gun in your face, bitch nigga\nBeef will have you praying to God\nMove your kids, have you hiding your mom\nBeef is when you hide behind them other niggas\nBut they ain't killers they ain't pullin' them triggers, fuck niggas\nBeef will have you keying our cars\nHeartbroke, yours don't look like ours\n\nThem niggas ain't dying for you\nThem niggas ain't dying for you\nThrowing that flag up running around you hot shit\nTaking half of everything you get\nYeah them niggas ain't dying for you\nThem niggas ain't dying for you\nAnd we know that\n\nWhat's beef? Beef is when you need 2 Gats to go to sleep\nBeef is when your moms ain't safe up in the streets\nBeef is when I see you\nGuaranteed to be in ICU, one more time\nWhat's beef? Beef is when you need 2 Gats to go to sleep\nBeef is when your moms ain't safe up in the streets\nBeef is when I see you\nGuaranteed to be in ICU, one more time"}}, {"title": "Feeling Myself",

millions\nCame out unscathed from the days of my dealing\nThe driver of that car wasn't made for a ceiling\nStill up on my nino\nSmelling like a kilo\nBut I'm downy fresh soft white like my Pinot\nFeeling myself so if he know like we know\nCross that line and get shot like a free throw\nRather be on fire at the tables out in Vegas\nUnder bright lights\nMiddle finger to you haters\nIn a perfect world\nJust my guns and my girl\nWe shine like diamonds and pearls and I'm feeling myself\nI'm feeling myself, pause\nI'm more cuff and I might take off\nSeems like haters never take a night

you all but I'm a get off\nCause I'm feeling myself\nShop until you drop\nThey say sharing is caring\nMore than my winnings\nWe can share opinions\nLike baby steps\nWe can share beginnings\nWalk before you run but she so independent\nAnd I could see us fly\nThe sky is the limit\nWe so real\nGot my own quarter mill\nCounting money on the bed\nWatching Deal Or No Deal\nIn a perfect world\nJust my guns and my girl\nWe shine like diamonds and pearls and I'm feeling myself\nI'm feeling myself, pause\nI'm more cuff and I might take off\nSeems like haters never take a night off\nBut you know I'm

off\nCause I'm feeling myself\nI propose a toast\nTo every living kingpin smart enough to delegate their work to their wing\nMan, keep a bad bitch on the arm of my bling and play my cards right\nNow I'm looking at a dream hand\nYes, got you looking at my poker face\nNo joker see it\nYou can call me smoking ace\nIn a perfect world\nJust my guns and my girl\nWe shine like diamonds and pearls and I'm feeling myself\nI'm feeling myself, pause\nI'm more cuff and I might take off\nSeems like haters never take a night off\nBut you know I'm a tell them that they can get lost\nCause I'm feeling

reason\nConcierge never speak\n\u2018Cause this week look like last week\nThey both named Ashley\nI might travel to El Barrio\nTo get it from Daddy-O then adios\nCellphone at the back patio\nI didn\u2019t have to make a cameo to get it off\n\nI hope you betting on the sleeper\nIt all started on a beeper\u00a0\nNow they asking for the feature\nTill I'm steppin' out the bleachers\nDrug money kicked around like it\u2019s FIFA\n\nYuugh! Pops up like dandruff\nBeverly Hills Jed Clampett\nA shotgun wedding to collect my ransom\nCameo Chris Hansen\nI\u2019m at your door\nYou don\u2019t wanna know him if you owe him\nI done boxed in cars and had to tow \u2018em\nI done laid in lawns when they didn\u2019t mow \u2018em\nEven hogtied wives, I had to show \u2018em\nThat I mean business\nI mean everything I say, no witness\nNo forgiveness, Souls of Mischief\u00a0\nIt\u2019s on through infinity, my arms are endless\nYour arms, too short to box with God\nMight send a bitch a Elie Saab\nShe fucks and robs\n10 grand just to touch the job\nClose range, she don\u2019t duck and dodge\nYou can\u2019t trust them odds\n\nI hope you betting on the sleeper\nIt all started on a beeper\u00a0\nNow they asking for the feature\nTill I'm

Ghostface, can it be so simple\n40 keys in a rental\nMy dogs bring it back, now you name a better kennel\nI keep cash, case Feds connect me\nCase kids kidnap me, kids can get back me\nNot concerned with your rap beef\nPoetic justice watching you sock puppets\nFuck it, I got my dope boys covered\nThe Arizona brick is 26 and they love it\nThou shalt not covet what thou cannot budget\u00a0\nI bury 2 mil in the Caymans they can\u2019t touch it\n\nFuck it, I got my dope boys covered\nFuck it, I got my dope boys covered\nFuck it, I got the dope boys covered\nFuck it, I got the dope boys covered\nThe Arizona brick is 26 and they love it\n\nTrap phone, gun at your backbone\nGraduated from the corner where the crack\u2019s thrown\nBack talk to your momma now you act grown\nListening to Young Dolph till the pack gone\nI relate to \u2018em\nI\u2019m a Pyrex God, shit I\u2019m great to \u2018em\nAll of you lil\u2019 niggas quote all of the wrong figures\nPoke all of the wrong bitches\nAnd follow the wrong niggas\nWhichever rapper hot at the moment\nDon\u2019t realize he a candle till he blow it\nI gave y\u2019all the game it\u2019s decoded\nThe only thing left is to grow it\nDrop a shoe, start a Play Cloths or two\nIt\u2019s all hustlin\u2019, so deja vu\nStill a nigga unwrap bricks\nI\u2019ma dye on that money like a bank got hit sniff\n\nFuck it, I got my dope boys covered\nFuck it, I got my dope boys covered\nFuck it, I got the dope boys covered\nFuck it, I got the dope boys covered\nThe Arizona brick is 26 and they love it\n\nGame too emo, I\u2019m too Nino\nMust stay low-key, I play Reno\nI\u2019m so Pesci, too Casino\u00a0\nWe Sinatra, Sammy, Dinos\nOutlandish, so illegal\nSo Carlito, so Pacino\nWe sip vino, the grapes of wrath\nMoney counter go till it breaks in half\nCoupes the flagship, it feels like futon\nPalm the paddle shift, abuse the redline\nThe home is ranch style, reflects the poolside\nPowder paved the way, the sword got two sides\nDuffle a hundred bands, trunk is 2-5\nMules are flying in, the drive from Tucson\nThe dash is hollowed out, we shortened the fuel line\nConnect is in Panama, in bed with the cruise lines\n\nFuck it, I got the dope boys covered\nFuck it, I got the dope boys covered\nThe Arizona brick is 26 and they love it"}}, {"title": "Hard Piano", "album": "DAYTONA", "year": "2018-05-25",

ruin my dreams or Harvey Weinstein the kid\nGood morning, Matt Lauer, can I live?\nLook at my new digs\nThe rooftop can host a paint and sip for like 40\nThe Warhols on my wall paint a war story\nHad to find other ways to invest\n'Cause you rappers found every way to ruin Pateks\nIt's a nightmare, yeah\nI'm too rare amongst all of this pink hair, ooh\nStill do the Fred Astaire on a brick\nTap tap, throw the phone if you hear it click\nArt Baselin' the bezel\nYour bustdown is bust down and don't match the metal\nLower level's where you settle at\nI'm the pot callin' the kettle black\nWhere there's no brick peddles at\nBetween God and where the Devil's at\nHad to double dutch and double back\nThen hopscotch through where the trouble's at\nExactly what the game's been missin'\nThis fire burns hot as Hell's Kitchen, Push\n\nNow that's how the team go, I'm back from Santo Domingo\nThat's where the kings go, down in Santo Domingo\nNow that's how the team go, back from Santo Domingo\nThis for the sneaker hoarders and coke snorters\n'Cause that's where the kings go, down in Santo Domingo\nFrom Honda Accords to Grammy awards\nThat's where the kings go\n\nI can blow a million dollars into dust\nLord knows how many bottles I've done bust\nStill runnin' through the models like I'm Puff\nConfront my problems like I'm Ralo in the bluff\nPusha know these politics is paradox\nChillin' in a condo full of ready rock\nMy homie amputated but gon' stand for somethin'\nI'm dyin' to find a way to get a Grammy from it (Maybach Music)\nWatchin' my success for some is bittersweet\nAlways keep the sharpshooter's triggers tweaked\nDiamonds drippin' on me via Tiffany's\nAll these K-9 units still sniffin' me\nIgnorance versus the innocence\nIt's not the temperature for you in Timberlands\nI keep the coldest flows on the hot seat\nAnd you can spot my hoes by their car keys\nAnother episode full of atrocities\nIt's double M, baby, money monopolies (Maybach Music)\nYou scared to see my face in a fancy place\nSo I debate my case vs. a Nancy Grace\nIt's flesh and blood 'til I'm fresh as fuck\nStill hands on, sucker, press your luck\nYour money gone every other month\nMy money long so the treasure's tucked\n\nNow that's how the team go, I'm back from Santo Domingo\nThat's where the kings go, down in Santo Domingo\nNow that's how the team go, back from Santo

let you ruin my dreams or Harvey Weinstein the kid\nGood morning, Matt Lauer, can I live?\nLook at my new digs\nThe rooftop can host a paint and sip for like 40\nThe Warhols on my wall paint a war story\nHad to find other ways to invest\n'Cause you rappers found every way to ruin Pateks\nIt's a nightmare, yeah\nI'm too rare amongst all of this pink hair, ooh\nStill do the Fred Astaire on a brick\nTap tap, throw the phone if you hear it click\nArt Baselin' the bezel\nYour bustdown is bust down and don't match the metal\nLower level's where you settle at\nI'm the pot callin' the kettle black\nWhere there's no brick peddles at\nBetween God and where the Devil's at\nHad to double dutch and double back\nThen hopscotch through where the trouble's at\nExactly what the game's been missin'\nThis fire burns hot as Hell's Kitchen, Push\n\nNow that's how the team go, I'm back from Santo Domingo\nThat's where the kings go, down in Santo Domingo\nNow that's how the team go, back from Santo Domingo\nThis for the sneaker hoarders and coke snorters\n'Cause that's where the kings go, down in Santo Domingo\nFrom Honda Accords to Grammy awards\nThat's where the kings go\n\nI can blow a million dollars into dust\nLord knows how many bottles I've done bust\nStill runnin' through the models like I'm Puff\nConfront my problems like I'm Ralo in the bluff\nPusha know these politics is paradox\nChillin' in a condo full of ready rock\nMy homie amputated but gon' stand for somethin'\nI'm dyin' to find a way to get a Grammy from it (Maybach Music)\nWatchin' my success for some is bittersweet\nAlways keep the sharpshooter's triggers tweaked\nDiamonds drippin' on me via Tiffany's\nAll these K-9 units still sniffin' me\nIgnorance versus the innocence\nIt's not the temperature for you in Timberlands\nI keep the coldest flows on the hot seat\nAnd you can spot my hoes by their car keys\nAnother episode full of atrocities\nIt's double M, baby, money monopolies (Maybach Music)\nYou scared to see my face in a fancy place\nSo I debate my case vs. a Nancy Grace\nIt's flesh and blood 'til I'm fresh as fuck\nStill hands on, sucker, press your luck\nYour money gone every other month\nMy money long so the treasure's tucked\n\nNow that's how the team go, I'm back from Santo Domingo\nThat's where the kings go, down in Santo Domingo\nNow that's how the team go, back from Santo Domingo\n'Cause that's where the kings go, down in Santo Domingo\nThat's where the kings go"}}, {"title": "H.G.T.V.

top know the king is nothin' to play with (yo)\n9 to 5 money is just as sweet as the grave shift (yo)\nEl president\u00e9, Blobama, blow by ya\nChopper next to me in every picture, Osama\nOh mama, they question my starting line up\nYou only find a diamond from diggin' like coal miners\nDon't listen to 'em, Desiigner\nThe same rappers talkin' next year will be Uber drivers (Fuck 'em)\nChanel dad hats, but you don't know that they got 'em\nTrap door shopper, they rotate the wall\nSo you will never see me as you rotate the mall\n330 spin, cook a steak up on this grill\nMe myself and I, we like a hamster in the wheel\nRolls emblem, Black Virginian\nPull in a neighborhood I don't blend in\nAlbum of the year contender every year\nThe kitchen's full of work, it's blenders everywhere\nBlended bitches everywhere that do the most\nThey never seen with him so they fuck his ghost\nInvisible man, timepiece with the invisible hands\nMJ, remember the time they counted in sand hourglass\nBut mine come with purse and heels\nAnd the DIY Gucci with the crest and shields\nIt's too far gone when the realest ain't real\nI walk amongst the clouds so your ceilings ain't real\nThese niggas Call of Duty cause their killings ain't real\nWith a questionable pen so the feelin' ain't real\nRap's John Grisham\nI can paint the picture with the words if you listen (shh)\nThe bar's been lowered, the well's run dry\nThey beefin' over melodies, but no, not I (yugh)\nSee I'm so top 5\nIf they factor in the truth I just might blow by\nBlowbama"}}, {"title": "Hold On", "album": "My Name Is My Name", "year":

child, no witness, no Jehovahs\nLike Scarface but it's God's face in that mirror\nWe was made in his image, dialing and it's much clearer\nScoring from the heights but I wanted mine purer\nAryan,

nigga\nNah, I ain't got nothing in common with yous\nPain in my heart, it's as black as my skin\nThey tipping the scale for these crackers to win\nNo reading, no writing, made us savage of men\nThey praying for jail but I mastered the pen\nDescended from kings, we at it again\nJust hand me the crown, I'm active again\nEverything that it seems, hear my passion again\nWas never my dream, the immaculate win\n\nI was pissing my shorts, having rich nigga thoughts\nWish I had a pistol before all the friends I done fought\nOvernight I seen a nigga go get a Carrera\nTwo weeks later I had to be that boy pallbearer\nYoung king bury me inside a glass casket\nWindex wipe me down for the life after\nCrack dealer living like a hoop star\nBlack marble, white walls in my new spot\nFour chains, big studs, a nigga too fly\nTop down, tank top, I think I'm 2Pac\nSo I'm labeled the rebel, nigga get on my level\nWe were born to be kings, only major league teams\nChasing my paper, couldn't fathom my wealth\nBuilt a school in Ethiopia, should enroll in myself\nGod body and mind, food for the soul\nWhen you feeding on hate, you empty, my nigga, it shows\nFollow the codes, ain\u2019t no love for

slaughtered, niggas' grandmothers assaulted\nThrow a gang sign, dare you do something about it\nFuck copping them foams, when you copping the home\nCop a kilo and have them people on top of your home\n\nFollow the codes, ain't no love for these hoes\nIf you slipping you fall, I got you, my nigga, hold on\nIf you right or you wrong, if you riding, come on\nBy the end of this song, I got you, my nigga, hold on\nI got you, my nigga, hold on\nI got you, my nigga, hold on\nIf you right or you wrong, if you riding, come on\nBy the end of this song, I got you, my nigga, hold on\nI got you, my

in my mind, you motherfuckers sold soap\nGot rich selling hope to the hopeless\nBut I\u2019m a thinker, methodic in my motives\nI motivate to put my niggas into motors\nNo woman, no child, no witness, no Jehovahs\nLike Scarface but it's God's face in that mirror\nWe was made in his image, dialing and it's much clearer\nScoring from the heights but I wanted mine purer\nAryan, blonde hair, blue-eyed like the F\u00fchrer\nThe judge and the jury, the jewellery mad froze\nWatercolors on my neck, fuck rhyming when you blinding niggas\nWe ain't the same color clarity of diamond, nigga\nNah, I ain't got nothing in common with yous\nPain in my heart, it's as black as my skin\nThey tipping the scale for these crackers to win\nNo reading, no writing, made us savage of men\nThey praying for jail but I mastered the pen\nDescended from kings, we at it again\nJust hand me the crown, I'm active again\nEverything that it seems, hear my passion again\nWas never my dream, the immaculate win\n\nI was pissing my shorts, having rich nigga thoughts\nWish I had a pistol before all the friends I done fought\nOvernight I seen a nigga go get a Carrera\nTwo weeks later I had to be that boy pallbearer\nYoung king bury me inside a glass casket\nWindex wipe me down for the life after\nCrack dealer living like a hoop star\nBlack marble, white walls in my new spot\nFour chains, big studs, a nigga too fly\nTop down, tank top, I think I'm 2Pac\nSo I'm labeled the rebel, nigga get on my level\nWe were born to be kings, only major league teams\nChasing my paper, couldn't fathom my wealth\nBuilt a school in Ethiopia, should enroll in myself\nGod body and mind, food for the soul\nWhen you feeding on hate, you empty, my nigga, it shows\nFollow the codes, ain\u2019t no love for these hoes\nIf you slip and you fall I got you, my nigga, hold on\nIf you right or you wrong, if you riding, come on\nBy the end of this song, can't be hiding for long\nI seen children get slaughtered, niggas' grandmothers assaulted\nThrow a gang sign, dare you do something about it\nFuck copping them foams, when you copping the home\nCop a kilo and have them people on top of your home\n\nFollow the codes, ain't no love for these hoes\nIf you slipping you fall, I got you, my nigga, hold on\nIf you right or you wrong, if you riding, come on\nBy the end of this song, I got you, my nigga, hold on\nI got you, my nigga, hold on\nI got you, my nigga, hold on\nIf you right or you wrong, if you riding, come on\nBy the end of this song, I got you, my nigga, hold on\nI got you, my

know, you know\n\nThis thing of ours, oh, this thing of ours\nA fraternity of drug dealers ringing off\nI just happen to be alumni\nToo legit, they still lookin' at me with one eye\nThe company I keep is not corporate enough\nChild Rebel Soldier, you ain't orphan enough\nA rapper turned trapper can't morph into us\nBut a trapper turned rapper can morph into Puff\nDance contest for the smokers\nI predict snow, Al Roker\n(If you know, you know)\nI only ever looked up to Sosa\nYou all get a bird, this nigga Oprah\n\nBricklayers in ball shorts\nCoaching from the side of the ball court\n(If you know, you know)\nOne stop like a Walmart\nWe got the tennis balls for the wrong sport\n(If you know, you know)\nIf you know 'bout the carport\nThe trap door supposed to be awkward\n(If you know, you know)\nThat's the reason we ball for\nCircle round twice for the encore\n(If you know, you know)\n\nYou ever been hit with the water weight\nThen had to wait? Do you war or wait?\n(If you know, you know)\nWhen we all clicking like Golden State\nAnd you and your team are the motorcade\n(If you know, you know)\nBeen grantin' wishes like a genie\nTo bad hoes in two-piece bikinis\nI've been hidin' where you can see me\nThe skybox is right next to RiRi's\nSolely responsible for showin' rappers how to stand\nOn the front lines when trappers started throwin' bands\nWhere were you when Big Meech brought the tigers in?\n'Cause I was busy earnin' stripes like a tiger's skin\n\nBricklayers in ball shorts\nCoaching from the side of the ball court\n(If you know, you know)\nOne stop like a Walmart\nWe got the tennis balls for the wrong sport\n(If you know, you know)\nIf you know 'bout the carport\nThe trap door supposed to be awkward\n(If you know, you know)\nThat's the reason we ball for\nCircle 'round twice for the encore\n(If you know, you know)", "image": "https://images.genius.com/99199dd6e0f60ef05789ba2cbe2a5d9b.1000x1000x1.jpg", "artist": "Pusha-T", "raw": {"annotation_count": 39, "api_path": "/songs/3721012", "description": {"dom": {"tag": "root", "children": [{"tag": "p", "children": ["On the opening track of his 2018 album, ", {"tag": "em", "children": ["DAYTONA"]}, ", Pusha T touches on a subject that he has been talking about ", {"tag": "a", "attributes": {"href": "https://centralsauce.com/pusha-t-drug-references", "rel": "nofollow"}, "children": ["most of his career"]}, ": crack/cocaine.

of risks, boy\n'Cause this boy been throwin' that D like Rich Boy\nYou missed, boy\nYa numbers don't add up on the blow\nThat was ten years ago; if you know, you know (yeah)\n\nIf you know, you know\nIf you know, you know\n\nThis thing of ours, oh, this thing of ours\nA fraternity of drug dealers ringing off\nI just happen to be alumni\nToo legit, they still lookin' at me with one eye\nThe company I keep is not corporate enough\nChild Rebel Soldier, you ain't orphan enough\nA rapper turned trapper can't morph into us\nBut a trapper turned rapper can morph into Puff\nDance contest for the smokers\nI predict snow, Al Roker\n(If you know, you know)\nI only ever looked up to Sosa\nYou all get a bird, this nigga Oprah\n\nBricklayers in ball shorts\nCoaching from the side of the ball court\n(If you know, you know)\nOne stop like a Walmart\nWe got the tennis balls for the wrong sport\n(If you know, you know)\nIf you know 'bout the carport\nThe trap door supposed to be awkward\n(If you know, you know)\nThat's the reason we ball for\nCircle round twice for the encore\n(If you know, you know)\n\nYou ever been hit with the water weight\nThen had to wait? Do you war or wait?\n(If you know, you know)\nWhen we all clicking like Golden State\nAnd you and your team are the motorcade\n(If you know, you know)\nBeen grantin' wishes like a genie\nTo bad hoes in two-piece bikinis\nI've been hidin' where you can see me\nThe skybox is right next to RiRi's\nSolely responsible for showin' rappers how to stand\nOn the front lines when trappers started throwin' bands\nWhere were you when Big Meech brought the tigers in?\n'Cause I was busy earnin' stripes like a tiger's skin\n\nBricklayers in ball shorts\nCoaching from the side of the ball court\n(If you know, you know)\nOne stop like a Walmart\nWe got the tennis balls for the wrong sport\n(If you know, you know)\nIf you know 'bout the carport\nThe trap door supposed to be awkward\n(If you know, you

shots at niggas cause I'm bored and they whores (Pussy!)\nI'm Kobe goin' for his sixth ring, while that church choir sing\nI'mma lean 'til they crown me king of New Orleans\nNow everybody so 80's, 90's-inspired\nBut none of you niggas 80's and 90's rhymin'\nYou laptop hot, just internet warm\nDown-low for downloads don't get caught up in my storm (Don't do it)\nFuck nigga, you just internet porn\nNow we don't gotta fake it no more, the line's drawn\nI'm too much dope dealer for rap niggas\nToo much closer to every trap nigga\nI'm just preachin' facts, nigga\nI'm more biased to the

shake\nI still wanna\nSleeping with the finest\nThe thread count is bindless\nSecurity blanket of cocaine, I am Linus\nIn this climate Im Kareem Burke tied in\nThe Roc silent partner I ain't throwing up the diamond\nThrowin on the sherwin, collars up, bottles up\nSparkles to the table, got em feeling like hes Merlin\nWhirlwind, powder makes your World spin\nLearn from OGs, Alpha Romeos and Sterling\nUpdated that, upgraded that\nSuffocation blue, in the insides potato sacks\nYeah, talk money, Im made of that\nCocaine parties, like the 70s I cater that\nYou know what fame is?\nSittin with the women of your dreams and forgettin what her name is\nYou know what pain is?\nFlushing 2 bricks and have a nigga try to strain it out the drainage\n\nSee my face on the news and it ain't Tivo\nI still wanna sell kilos\nIts like Im throwing rocks at the pen begging for the rico\nI still wanna sell kilos\nSearching for the fish scale like Im tryna find Nemo\nI still wanna sell kilos\nThats what happens when you Michael and they try to treat you like Tito\nI still wanna sell kilos\nGrew up watching momma car repoed\nA little nigga staring through the peep hole\nHow you think I felt knowing daddy wasn't there\nRecycling cans cause nobody ever cared\nGet it how you live, always echoed in the streets\nWhen we talking business, talking on the phone cease\nFeds listening to conversations through my own star\nPiecing puzzles together solving homocides ?\nDice game chatter, better bring your stash out\nRed Velour, Im in the white glass house\nHalf a ticket bitches quick to drop it on the scale\nFiddling dope a real nigga sell yayo\nEveryday a nigga dies than we can't ask why\nShow em all love, the bitches f-cked on the side\nTony Montana, tailor made suits in the church\nRolls Royce corniche, trunk full of work\n\nSee my face on the news and it ain't Tivo\nI still wanna sell kilos\nIts like Im throwing rocks at the pen begging for the rico\nI still wanna sell kilos\nSearching for the fish scale like Im tryna find Nemo\nI still wanna sell kilos\nThats what happens when you Michael and they try to treat you like Tito\nI still wanna sell kilos\nTestarossa top models, G4s, Gucci pass the crease off\nEverything I climb in, I win\nRicher male, ?, remarkable timing\nBlack label everything, logos in the lining\nBell Biv DeVoe push poison like a copper head\nPowder smoke clears through the walking dead\nThe Rose bottles pour for the Champions\nYou think it was a Grammy win\nCelebration spills through the morning like an ambion\nBithces love my ambience\nChain swinging, ticker taping like its Mardi Gras\nThousand niggas deep, never needed body guards\nThousands keys that Im about to do pilates on\nWhere the Kings crowned like the grill a Maseratis on\nCandy coated parked, doors ajar, on a stripper\nBlew a fuse and caught a body on\nCocaine storaging\nLiva living dreams, ya DeLoreans pouring in", "image":

forgettin what her name is\nYou know what pain is?\nFlushing 2 bricks and have a nigga try to strain it out the drainage\n\nSee my face on the news and it ain't Tivo\nI still wanna sell kilos\nIts

and they try to treat you like Tito\nI still wanna sell kilos\nGrew up watching momma car repoed\nA little nigga staring through the peep hole\nHow you think I felt knowing daddy wasn't there\nRecycling cans cause nobody ever cared\nGet it how you live, always echoed in the streets\nWhen we talking business, talking on the phone cease\nFeds listening to conversations through my own star\nPiecing puzzles together solving homocides ?\nDice game chatter, better bring your stash out\nRed Velour, Im in the white glass house\nHalf a ticket bitches quick to drop it on the

through the walking dead\nThe Rose bottles pour for the Champions\nYou think it was a Grammy win\nCelebration spills through the morning like an ambion\nBithces love my ambience\nChain swinging, ticker taping like its Mardi Gras\nThousand niggas deep, never needed body guards\nThousands keys that Im about to do pilates on\nWhere the Kings crowned like the grill a Maseratis on\nCandy coated parked, doors ajar, on a stripper\nBlew a fuse and caught a body on\nCocaine storaging\nLiva living dreams, ya DeLoreans pouring in"}}, {"title": "I Still Wanna", "album": "Fear of God", "year":

And I ain\u2019t never had to watch nigga\nRich or wealthy, pick your poison\nI think I paid for one too many abortions\u00a0\nAnother Celine, it\u2019s like a routine\nIt\u2019s like ferris wheel of waist trainers and Seven jeans\nHer new body's in my new body\nMake her in an hourglass that\u2019s my new hobby\nRich nigga shit, how I blew my first million\nLuckily was somethin\u2019 in the

hold court\nLawyers get bought\nPalms get greased when them cases get fought\nNo felony what the fuck is you tellin\u2019 me\nReduced to simple assault\nIt cost to keep it hush-hush\nIt was just us\nEnded up sellin\u2019 my Bat Mobile\nThe crash don\u2019t kill\nIt\u2019s how you survives it\nRebound on niggas, I nine live\u2019d it\nCouldn\u2019t miss a Super Bowl or a Cancun\nBitches

never see a Brinks truck follow a hearse\u00a0\nI ain\u2019t never see a dead man taking the stand\nI ain\u2019t never see a nigga swallow a bullet\u00a0\nAnd live to talk about it\n'Bout that bread,

digits\nAnything Spanish, got me speaking Spanglish\nMoney's universal, that's the only language\nThe dream ain't die, only some real niggas\nWe was born to mothers who couldn't deal with us\nLeft by fathers who wouldn't build with us\nI have both mine home, let's keep it real niggas\nMy better half chose a better path, applaud him\nYounger brother - me, a spoiled child, I fought him\nI heard that the Devil's new playground is boredom\nThe California top just falls back like Autumn\nAnd they say I'm on the verge of winning\nI'll claim victory when Malice on the verge of sinning\nOld habits die hard, the rainy day bag buried in the backyard\nIt's Heaven for a hustla, no graveyards\nCause stand up niggas don't lie on no floors\nMuch rather burn us, ashes to ashes\nMix it with the powder, sell it to the masses\nWe gon' keep it tight, rip it out the plastic\nNow you celebrate, muthafuckas raise your glasses\nPUSH!!!"}}, {"title": "King Push", "album": "My Name Is My Name", "year":

blocked ours\nDope boys, block bleeders\nGold diggers don't stop either\nMotivation is misguided\nIf you hit the mark, then it's not needed\nCarry on like a carry on, on my side bitch I let tag along\nCall me \"daddy\" from a complex\n'Cause her mother's fucker wouldn't marry mom\nNo excuses, no regard\nStep on the brick like a promenade\nTwenty thousand on calling cards\nAnd I'm speaking Spanish like Don Omar\n\nBut I'm King Push, this king push\nI rap nigga 'bout trap niggas, I don't sing hooks\n\nFuck nigga with the sly talk\nMiss me with all the pie talk\nWhen them lights on you and them letters there\nYou point us out just like an eye-chart\nBut that's my fault, my details of the sidewalk\nFor eleven years, we seen better years\nWe was sellin' birds over the time port\nMy first Grammy was my first brick\nRed carpet, every bad bitch\nMore BMF than Billboard\nI got a label deal under my mattress\n\n'Cause I'm King Push, still King Push\nI rap nigga 'bout trap niggas, I don't sing hooks, ah!\n\nVultures to my culture\nExploit the struggle, insult ya\nThey name dropping 'bout Caine copping\nBut never been a foot soldier\nLet's have another look, just get a little closer\nRage against the machine, black Zack de la Rocha\nIn a cranberry Rossta, inside track on the G rap poster\nBest D-boy, all I'm missing is a dash\nDifference between me and Hova\n\nBut I'm King Push, still King Push\nI rap nigga 'bout trap niggas, I don't sing hooks, ah!", "image": "https://images.genius.com/324abe3d1e81bc03ab9ad30ec3137e50.500x500x1.jpg", "artist": "Pusha-T", "raw":

\"daddy\" from a complex\n'Cause her mother's fucker wouldn't marry mom\nNo excuses, no regard\nStep on the brick like a promenade\nTwenty thousand on calling cards\nAnd I'm speaking Spanish like Don Omar\n\nBut I'm King Push, this king push\nI rap nigga 'bout trap niggas, I don't sing hooks\n\nFuck nigga with the sly talk\nMiss me with all the pie talk\nWhen them lights on you and them letters there\nYou point us out just like an eye-chart\nBut that's my fault, my details of the sidewalk\nFor eleven years, we seen better years\nWe was sellin' birds over the time port\nMy first Grammy was my first brick\nRed carpet, every bad bitch\nMore BMF than Billboard\nI got a label deal under my mattress\n\n'Cause I'm King Push, still King Push\nI rap nigga 'bout trap niggas, I don't sing hooks, ah!\n\nVultures to my culture\nExploit the struggle, insult ya\nThey name dropping 'bout Caine copping\nBut never been a foot soldier\nLet's have another look, just get a little closer\nRage against the machine, black Zack de la Rocha\nIn a cranberry Rossta, inside track on the G rap poster\nBest D-boy, all I'm missing is a dash\nDifference between me and Hova\n\nBut I'm King Push, still King

love you\n\nUh, I know that you think I'm the one, but who doesn't?\nIt comes with the territory when you buzzin'\nA ball player sold you a dream, ain't do nothing\nA couple rappers under your belt, but who's judging?\nI ain't trying to guide you, hand on Bible\nBut Instagram pics show more than side views\nThirty-dollar nude catsuits is not cute\nAnd fifty comments on ass is not fluke\nSo, no cuffing, no buns in the oven\nIf my girl call your phone, she's just bluffin'\nAs long as you and I both know we just fuckin'\nIf anybody else do ask, we just nothing\n\nBoy, you got that six in the morning\nYou got that thing that'll make a girl feel high\nOh, I say boy, you got me lonely\nJust say the words, I'll do anything you want\nBoy, let me love you\n\nHey mama, come fuck with the shotta\nWith the Givenchy toppa, shoe Balenciaga\nIf you act right, I can match you up proper\nIf it's about a dollar thing, big like Poppa\nIntroduce your exes to my choppa\nDon't listen to your best friend, she don't matter\nYou know she wanna be you in that vehicle\nRiding in see-through V1, V2\nChanel or Celine, however I see you\nChristians or Chloe, damn, them C's too\nYou know I play fair, I'm Daddy Day Care\nI know it ain't cheap for you to lay here\n\nBoy, you got that six in the morning\nYou got that thing that'll make a girl feel high\nOh, I say boy, you got me lonely\nJust say the words, I'll do anything you want\nBoy, let me love you\n\nLet's get past the nonsense and be honest\nAll the ones I sponsored clear my conscience\nCan't commit the crime without accomplice\nWe both to blame, let's push the shame behind us\nOn the DL, pushin' my brother\u2019s CL\nMeet you at the spot, you had tint on the TL\nIt\u2019s only right you shake them phony types\nAnd embrace the kid, like my bracelets did\nUh, I\u2019m from the era where the money come fast\nBlow it all 'cause the money don\u2019t last\nAll them broke niggas lookin' puppy-dog sad\nShe in that new purse, sayin', \"Honey, don\u2019t ask\"\n\nBoy, you got that six in the morning\nYou got that thing that'll make a girl feel high\nOh, I say boy, you got me lonely\nJust say the words, I'll do anything you

I didn't have to wait in the line at bakery on Sunday mornings anymore for fresh bread. The owner knew who I was with and he'd come from around the counter. No matter how many people were waiting, I was taken care of first. Our neighbors didn't park in our driveway anymore, even though we didn't have a car. I mean at 13, I was making more money than most of the grownups in the neighborhood.  I mean I had more money than I could spend. I had it all!\n\nI'm up in the woods\nI'm down on my mind\nI'm building a still\nTo slow down time\nI'm lost in the world\nI'm down on my line\nI'm new in the city\nAnd I'm down for the night\nDown for the night\nSaid shes down for the night\nI'm lost in the world\nI'm down on my line\nI'm new in the city\nAnd I'm down for the night\nDown for the night\nSaid shes down for the night\n\nLook at my situation, I couldn\u2019t ask for more\nI\u2019m the real Situation, I should be on Jersey Shore\nLook what that kilo sent me\nThat Porsche is key less entry\nThat girl is high and drunk, I swear the rest is elementary\nWe found a superfreak, no, she won\u2019t know what hit her\nI\u2019m on my Rick James, minus the beads and glitter\nYou\u2019ve got to beg my pardon, this shit here is money talking\nYou don\u2019t get good dick too often, I\u2019mma have you funny walking\nSee that shit I pull up parking, make your neck snap the fuck off and\nDamn, too late you lost it, back to that world you lost in\nBack to that world you lost in\n\nI'm up in the woods, I'm down on my mind\n(Run from the lights, run from the night)\nI'm new in the city, but I'm down for the night\n(Run for your life, down for the night)\nI'm lost in the world, been down my whole life\nI'm new in the city, and I'm down for the night\nDown for the night\nDown for the night\nWho will survive in America?\nWho

wars\n40 thousand on the floor when them bottles pour (Spill, nigga)\nA Blu Ray to your DVD\nYou might've caught me on TMZ\nCameo tryna sue a nigga (Fuck 'em)\nCause I party hard like it's three of me\nAmerica's still abusing us\nAnd 9/11 is the Ku Klux\nSo why wouldn't I fire back\nWhen every day them niggas shooting us?\nTrue enough, I'm out of line\nYou better stand for something 'fore you out of time\nThis is crime by design\nIf the crown ain't mine, tell me who am I behind\n\nYeah, I'm taking niggas' lunch money\nToo bad, I was fucking hungry\nReal niggas don't notice you\nI'm the only dopeboy quotable\n\nPoppy get me everything I want\nRiding 'round with Miguel Cotto in the trunk\nWhat I'm cooking in the kitchen, niggas\nBobby Brown, New Edition, niggas\nWhat I'm wearing in this blizzard, nigga\nMink, leather or it's lizard, nigga\nSaint Laurent, I'm in all layers\nThe mannequin to you ballplayers\nShout out my Mac 11 monster\nGrew up on Nintendo playing Contra\nAnd though that nigga only 5'9\"\n100 bodies on his timeline\nWhat's the price of success?\nLost my bitch, bought a chef\nThe 911 cost 211\nWatch looking like a jeweler's heaven\nHottest 7, I'm so alive\nYour bank account Swiss, nigga, so is mine\nThis is crime by design\nIf the crown ain't mine, tell me who am I behind\n\nYeah, I'm taking niggas' lunch money\nToo bad, I was fucking

nigga get religious\nAmen!\n\nYou rather be more famous than rich\nPlay your role, it\u2019s easy acting like Mitch\n\u201cPaid In Full\u201d was more than reading a script\nPaid in full is really just being Rich Porter\nFilling all standing orders\nWould you question could I swim if you saw me walking on water?\nYeah, while every song got a rapper dance\nYuugh, I\u2019m drug money like Dapper Dan\nNo retirement plans, no Derek Jeters\nWe all know I did it; Rodriguez\nThe illusion of money we don\u2019t believe in\nYou ask me, Tyga looking like a genius\nI\u2019m Kim Jong of the crack song\nGil Scott-Heron to the black poem\nWoo, the revolution will be televised\n\u2018Cause we done see all and they telling lies\n\nCreep up on these niggas\nCreep up on these niggas\nSpeak up on

it\u2019s easy being my bitch\nIt\u2019s only right for a queen to floss your shit\nRolex crowns, I emboss your wrist\nThe minimums, niggas ain\u2019t synonyms\nDual exhausts, driving flying saucers\nDiamond crosses, hang Takashi portraits\nStreet millionaires rub shoulders\nAnd laugh at bitches fucking promoters\nHoping that they get noticed, still driving a Focus\nWhat you fuck him for if you didn\u2019t know what the goal was?\nShine, remote control blinds\nThat turn on the time lapse, controlled by the iPad\nAhhh, my living room rap scream crack money\nI don\u2019t trust rap niggas or rap money\nSee this air hole tech and get ratttttt from me\n\nCreep up on these niggas\nCreep up on these niggas\nSpeak up on these niggas\nSpeak up on a nigga\nWalk up in that bitch and wave at everything\nWalk up in that bitch and wave at everything\nGo and make it bang, go and make it bang\nGettin\u2019 followed by them hollows, go and make it bang\nNiggas ain\u2019t been to church in a minute\nBut it\u2019s funny how that TEC make a nigga get religious\nAmen!\n\nNiggas talking it, but ain\u2019t living it\nTwo years later admitting it, all them niggas is renting shit\nThey ask why I\u2019m still talking dope, why not?\nThe biggest rappers in the game broke, voil\u00e0\nThey say it\u2019s hate, but it\u2019s these well-dressed snakes\nThat learn to walk on the concrete, I just saw it and spoke to it\nYuugh, you ain\u2019t know, you got coached through it\nWooo, the rap fans got hoaxed through it\nHaaa, the whole time I sold coke through it\nNigga, and records I was Bo through it\nKing Push is synonymous with kingpin\nChess moves on your checkerboard, king him\nYeah, this is gun slingers and Goyard\nUh, this is O Dog in the courtyard\nYou wonder why I\u2019m still here\nI\u2019m America\u2019s worst nightmare\nNight, night nigga\n\nCreep up on these niggas\nCreep up on these niggas\nSpeak up on these niggas\nSpeak up on a nigga\nWalk up in that bitch and wave at everything\nWalk up in that bitch and wave at everything\nGo and make it bang, go and make it bang\nGettin\u2019 followed by them hollows, go and make it bang\nNiggas ain\u2019t been to church in a

that my core follows\nWe don\u2019t mourn for the dead nigga, we pour bottles\nDrown sorrows, ocean blue Murcielagos\nStarted with similac powder in a baby bottle\nThe formula is warning ya\nCrack kills offerings to the coroner\nKill my eldest brother? Nigga, I\u2019ll be damned\nGator at my momma\u2019s house, welcome to zombie land\nA hustler\u2019s paradise, a lucky pair of dice\nDown 40 but a streak will have you square by night\nDidn't bat an eye I at it, kept the poker face\nCause the batter I add had the coca base\nWhen you get to heaven\u2019s door they won\u2019t hold a space\nIf you numb like the flesh on a smoker\u2019s face\nThere\u2019s no feeling like your bitch chin chilling right\nYou in Italian leather and you're four wheeling right\nYou know you\u2019re up when you count a quarter mil in white\nAnd if you down you can slang it like a pillow fight\nI\u2019m a wizard at it, nigga here\u2019s the magic\nMake a small town feel like I throw a blizzard at it\nGet the green from the scale like a lizard had it\nBear witness as I unveil this instant classic\n\nYes! My God!\n\nThe Second Coming is in the second verse\nThe first coming still here, so I\u2019ll need a hearse\nI got a voodoo doll every time I pen a verse\nNot only do they say they feel it but say it hurts\nNo pain, no gain, nigga\nThey say I\u2019m heating up, welcome to the flame, nigga\nNo matter the success, still the same nigga\nI only change when the new body came, nigga\nAerodynamic, roof panoramic\nMy credit score let the dealer take full advantage\nPaid over sticker price, cash under handed\nThe 012 a year early, I\u2019m a time bandit\nGotta time manage when you heaving snow\nAble to drop it all at 30 and be free to go\nOnly deal with divas on a need to know\nAnd what you need to know is when you need to go\nThey\u2019ll be no waiting, I have no patience\nThis is the end for all my unrecognized greatness\nI\u2019m here now, nigga, pardon my lateness\nYou can hear in every bar and every cadence\nIt\u2019s the new god flow, ain\u2019t it\nThe last supper for you niggas now repainted\nTake position on the chess board and rearrange it\nFace to face with the truth, get reacquainted"}}, {"title": "My Name Is My Name [Booklet]", "album": "My Name Is My Name", "year":

baby-faced monster\nNo wonder there's diaper rash on my conscience\nMy teething ring was numbed by the nonsense\nGem Star razor and a dinner plate\nArm & Hammer and a Mason jar, that's my dinner date\nThen crack the window in the kitchen, let it ventilate\n'Cause I let it sizzle on the stove like a minute steak\nNigga, I was crack in the school zone\nTwo beepers on me, Starter jacket that was two-toned\nFour lockers, four different bitches got their mule on\nBlack Ferris Bueller, cutting school with his jewels on\nCouldn't do wrong with a chest full of chains and a arm full of watches\nWhat I sell for pain in the hood, I'm a doctor\nZhivago tried to fight the urge like Ivan Drago, if he dies, he dies\nLike Doughboy to Tre, if he rides, he rides\nThrowing punches in his room, if he cries, he cries\nWe don't drink away the pain, when a nigga die\nWe add a link to the chain, inscribe a nigga name in your flesh\nWe playin' on a higher game of chess\nOnce you delegate his bills, who gon' fuck his bitch the best?\nA million megapixels of the Pyrex\nStarted on the scale digital, my only Timex\nNigga, this is timeless, simply 'cause it's honest\nPure as the fumes that be fuckin' with my sinus\nNigga, this is Simon Says, Simon red\nBlood on your diamonds 'til you dying \u2013 dead; yuugh!\n\n\"You better change what comes out your speaker\"\n\"Dee-dee-dee, dah-dee, dah-dee, dee-dee, dah-dee, day-ah\" (What is it?)\n\nYou wanna see a dead body?\nInstrumentals from my momma's Christmas party\nTroubles on my mind\nI still smell crime, my little brother crying\nSmokers repeatedly buying my Sega Genesis, either that\nOr my auntie was stealing it, hit the pipe and start feeling it\nOoh, wee, cut me some slack, weed never did that\nThis was different, geez, Louise, please help me relax\nQuantum physics could never show you the world I was in\nWhen I was ten, back when nine ounces had got you ten\nAnd nine times out of ten, niggas don't pay attention\nAnd when there's tension in the air, nines come with extensions\nMy daddy turned a quarter piece to a four and a half\nTook a L, started selling soap fiends bubble bath\nBroke his nails misusing his pinky to treat his nose\nShirt buttoned open, taco meat laying on his gold\nI said, \"Daddy, one day, I'mma get you right with 36 zips\n1000 grams of cocaine, then your name will be rich\nNow you can rock it up or sell it soft as leather interior\nDrop some ice cubes in it, Deebo on perimeter\"\nHe said, \"Son, how come you think you be my connect?\"\nI said, \"Pops, your ass is washed up, with all due respect\"\nHe said, \"Well, nigga, then show me how it all makes sense\"\nGo figure, motherfucker, every verse is a brick, your son dope, nigga\nNow reap what you sowed, nigga (Please reap what you sowed, nigga)\nI was born in '87, my grand daddy a legend\nNow the same shit that y'all was smoking is my profession, let's get it\n\n\"You better change what comes out your

feel pain, 'cause I done felt too much pain\nStanding in the rain, blood flowing through my veins\nI ain't never did a thing, getting money, rocking chains\nWe'll never feel the same, we the thugs in the game\nI don't never feel pain\n\n18 wheeler gorillas\nBlack with gold chains, pitch bird like Steelers\nHines Ward of the crime lords\nRunning through this money screaming \"encore\"\nSpending nights with the prime whore\nBut that's the bitch that you're blind for\nCelebrating on a whim, nigga\nPain is Pac Above the Rim, nigga\nMy bitch rock a bigger gem, niggas\nCause she was there when it was dim, nigga\nShe wasn't fucking none of them niggas\nSo now we're even like a hem, nigga\nPut your freedom over failure\nTryna find my Griselda (La Madrina!)\nMight as well, they gon' nail ya\nMomma screaming like Mahalia\nPain is love and it's war\nPain is running out of raw\nPain is finding out you're poor\nAs the Feds knock at your door\n\nI don't never feel pain, 'cause I done felt too much pain\nBeen around here, standing in the rain, blood flowing through my veins\nI'm just doing my thing, getting money, rocking tons of gold chains\nI don't never feel pain, 'cause I done felt too much pain\nI'm just standing in the rain, blood flowing through my veins\nI'm just doing my thing, getting money, rock a hundred gold chains\nMillion dollars on one gold ring\n\nPain is joy when it cries\nIt's my smile in disguise\nIt's what makes the story chilling\nSpare the women and the children\nHear the scribbles of the villain, yugh!\nThis is drug dealer brilliance\nPyrex on the platter like hot sex\nBut my tribe don't quest like love\nPain in this bitch, with a mask and a glove\nAnd a team of lawyers to run the train on the judge\nIt's no risk without gain\nIt's no trust without shame\nIt's no us without 'caine\nPush, my name is my name\nIn the kitchen with a cape on, apron\nTre-eight on, coulda been Trayvon\nBut instead I chose Avon\nPowder face like a geisha\nArm & Hammer for the breakup\nTurn one into two, watch the brick kiss and makeup (woo!)\nIt's a match made in heaven\nAll that's missing is the reverend\nAll that's missing is a blessing\nI hope God gets the message\n\nI don't never feel pain, 'cause I done felt too much pain\nBeen around here, standing in the rain, blood flowing through my veins\nI'm just doing my thing, getting money, rocking tons of gold chains\nI don't never feel pain, 'cause I done felt too much pain\nI'm just standing in the rain, blood flowing through my veins\nI'm just doing my thing, getting money, rock a hundred gold chains\nMillion dollars on one gold ring"}}, {"title": "Peso (Freestyle)", "album": "Freestyle Fridays Part 4", "year": null, "lyrics": "Since we on the topic, let me be obnoxious\nBitch that

our \u201dOtis\"\nNow witness the chosen\nIt\u2019s just different here\nMonte Carlo nights, let her throw the dice\nPlay in paradise\nAll I know is white\nGet the powder gone\nBitches love to shop, levitate the mall\nMattress full of money, let it break the fall\nWoo! She used to fly on a buddy pass\nThey say when the money go, you hope that your honey last\nI been preaching since money, cash\u2014 hoes\n\nAnd I promise, I hardly see you\nFrom where I am it\u2019s so hard to see you\nGot money I\u2019ve been different ever since\nMaybe it\u2019s me and my arrogance\nWho are you, who are you anyway?\nWho are you, who are you anyway?\nWho are you? We don\u2019t know you\nWho are you? We don\u2019t know you\n\nI\u2019m the fire and the base\nI\u2019m admired by the greats\nThis to each and every rap nigga\nI look you liars in the face\nCold case, Rolls Wraith\u00a0\nBig dipper, constellation in the ceiling, see the stars\nSee the jewelry, all rock, no guitar\u00a0\nWho you know better with the raw?\nBogota, she like finessing niggas\nShe gets a Range Rover Sport\u00a0\nAnd got seats on the court from the best of niggas\nI never bit at that apple\nI never lost my El Chapo\nI can still grab it, and bag it and capsule\u00a0\nCovered in white like I walked in the chapel\nI\u2019m that cold\n\nAnd I promise, I hardly see you\nFrom where I am it\u2019s so hard to see you\nGot money I\u2019ve been different ever since\nMaybe it\u2019s me and my arrogance\nWho are you, who are you anyway?\nWho are you, who are you anyway?\nWho are you? We don\u2019t know you\nWho are you? We don\u2019t know you\n\nThe last dope dealer\nRed leather in a room full of Thrillers\nThe mamas, they zombies\nChase a nigga for the money, they behind me\nWoo, safe look like it got a printer\nAin\u2019t no rappers in that Sprinter\nAin\u2019t no saints, only sinners\nWhat bitch ain\u2019t fucked a winner?\nI\u2019m a blue ribbon nigga\nTalk down on you two pigeon niggas\nFront

different than the priest, priest\nSanteria (Santeria, Santeria, Santeria)\n\nThey say that death comes in threes, how appropriate ('propriate)\nTriple back, they rush in like Soviets (Soviets)\nAt the Kremlin\nSearching for the green like a Gremlin, presidential emblem\nPresidential tint on this shit that I am driven in (woo!)\nI just place orders and drop dollars\nRottweilers roam the grounds, the Glock hollers\nThe three of y'all too accessible\nSeen all the wrong moves, watching The Untouchables\nWe don't do vegetables, niggas get flatlined\nWelcome all beef, then we heat 'em with flat irons\nYour plans are backfiring, think of double-crossing a priest\nHail Mary, repeat after me\nSanteria!\n\nYa te vas a la ma\u00f1ana (ma\u00f1ana)\nHa-ah, los \u00e1ngeles esperar\u00e1n\nEs el

all the things I've ever paid for\nKnow that it's no price tag when I wage war\nIt's no more to pray for, niggas get preyed on\nDarken my doorstep, they told me the day's gone\nYou listening, De'von?\nAs I'm talking to your spirit, for God's sakes\nI'm dealing with heartbreak\nChecking my ego, I'm livin' with lost faith\nI'm backin' this hit, nigga, you ever seen Shark Tank?\nI paid 'em in small bills, all of 'em small face\nI bet when we draw blood, you niggas will draw a blank\nDress you in all black, partnered with All Saints\nOur numbers is all facts, my shooters give all thanks\nAnd all praise, no jail bars can save\nLeave you like Malcolm where X marks your grave\nHey, it's probably better this way\nIt's cheaper when the chaplain prays\nSanteria!\n\nYa te vas a la ma\u00f1ana (ma\u00f1ana)\nHa-ah, los \u00e1ngeles esperar\u00e1n\nEs el fuego que yo\u2014conozco\nEs el fuego que yo\u2014"}}, {"title": "Scared money", "album": null, "year": null, "lyrics": "Grab

winter coupe hibernates, here's where I dominate\nThe longest runnin' trap star street niggas nominate over all\nAll the watches get overhauled\nBitches get over, dog, can't limit the protocol\nDon't

hey!\n\nNow when the phone start to click in, your words start to echo\nSay you got to hang up but the man won't let go\nOh, my nigga say it ain't so\nNow we speaking on some niggas that he say he ain't know\nWe used to steal dirt bikes, dodge raindrops\nSo close niggas thought we had the same pops\nGraduated, gettin' money on the same blocks\nBut things changed and we ain't end up in the same box\nHearing whispers, \"it ain't adding up\"\nGiving you the jailhouse talk but you ain't mad enough\nI never thought I'd be the last man standing up\nI never thought I'd had have to question \"Were you man enough?\"\nLong letters how the streets got the best of you\nTelling all your cellies how come I ain't sitting next to you\nYeah, see I can read between the lines\nSo it's awkward when you call and I gotta press 5\n\nSorry nigga, I'm tryna come home\nSorry nigga, I'm tryna come home\nI think the Feds are looking through me, can't you hear it in my tone?\nSo then sorry nigga, I'm tryna come home, hey!\n\nGot me tiptoeing through the conversation on our calls\nTryna act normal but the writing is on the wall\nIt's like I hear you smiling when you heard they hit the wall\nBut I just let it ride so I don't be the next to fall\n\"They sayin' Terrion been getting money while I'm gone\nAnd won't he tryna to holla at my bitch when I was home\"\n\"Nah, he selling cars, it'd be him and Lil Rome\"\nI'm just tryna offset what he was saying on my phone\nNowadays niggas don't need shovels to bury you\nPointing fingers like pallbearers how they carry you\nSo much for death before dishonor\nMight as well have a robe and gavel like your honor\nI just sit and wonder, play it by the numbers\nWhen you ride like lightning then you crash like thunder\nSeen your baby mama, she ain't even know if she should speak\nWhat the fuck is there to say knowing her king's now weak saying...\n\nSorry nigga, I'm tryna come home\nSorry nigga, I'm tryna come home\nWell, the walls are talking to me and I know you think I'm wrong\nBut sorry nigga, I'm tryna come home, hey!\n\nLet's talk real niggas, let's speak real, nigga\nHow many niggas you knew snitching you ain't killed, nigga?\nCovered his own tracks, he didn't care that\nWe had a legacy he killed, I got to wear that\nEvery move we ever made is getting stared at\nI bet the man inside his mirror doesn't stare back\nBreak your heart when the man you call your brother\nBe the same one that setting in motion all them undercovers\nCalled my mom mother, was at my graduation\nWhen I signed my record deal you was my motivation\nUh, from great friends now it's no affiliation\nDivided by the time he was facing, once he told me that...\n\nSorry nigga, I'm tryna come home\nSorry nigga, I'm tryna come home\nWell, the walls are talking to me and I know you think I'm wrong\nBut sorry nigga, I'm tryna come home, hey!", "image": "https://images.genius.com/324abe3d1e81bc03ab9ad30ec3137e50.500x500x1.jpg", "artist": "Pusha-T",

wrong\nBut sorry nigga, I'm tryna come home, hey!\n\nNow when the phone start to click in, your words start to echo\nSay you got to hang up but the man won't let go\nOh, my nigga say it ain't so\nNow we speaking on some niggas that he say he ain't know\nWe used to steal dirt bikes, dodge raindrops\nSo close niggas thought we had the same pops\nGraduated, gettin' money on the same blocks\nBut things changed and we ain't end up in the same box\nHearing whispers, \"it ain't adding up\"\nGiving you the jailhouse talk but you ain't mad enough\nI never thought I'd be the last man standing up\nI never thought I'd had have to question \"Were you man enough?\"\nLong letters how the streets got the best of you\nTelling all your cellies how come I ain't sitting next to you\nYeah, see I can read between the lines\nSo it's awkward when you call and I gotta press 5\n\nSorry nigga, I'm tryna come home\nSorry nigga, I'm tryna come home\nI think the Feds are looking through me, can't you hear it in my tone?\nSo then sorry nigga, I'm tryna come home, hey!\n\nGot me tiptoeing through the conversation on our calls\nTryna act normal but the writing is on the wall\nIt's like I hear you smiling when you heard they hit the wall\nBut I just let it ride so I don't be the next to fall\n\"They sayin' Terrion been getting money while I'm gone\nAnd won't he tryna to holla at my bitch when I was home\"\n\"Nah, he selling cars, it'd be him and Lil Rome\"\nI'm just tryna offset what he was saying on my phone\nNowadays niggas don't need shovels to bury you\nPointing fingers like pallbearers how they carry you\nSo much for death before dishonor\nMight as well have a robe and gavel like your honor\nI just sit and wonder, play it by the numbers\nWhen you ride like lightning then you crash like thunder\nSeen your baby mama, she ain't even know if she should speak\nWhat the fuck is there to say knowing her king's now weak saying...\n\nSorry nigga, I'm tryna come home\nSorry nigga, I'm tryna come home\nWell, the walls are talking to me and I know you think I'm wrong\nBut sorry nigga, I'm tryna come home, hey!\n\nLet's talk real niggas, let's speak real, nigga\nHow many niggas you knew snitching you ain't killed, nigga?\nCovered his own tracks, he didn't care that\nWe had a legacy he killed, I got to wear that\nEvery move we ever made is getting stared at\nI bet the man inside his mirror doesn't stare back\nBreak your heart when the man you call your brother\nBe the same one that setting in motion all them undercovers\nCalled my mom mother, was at my graduation\nWhen I signed my record deal you was my motivation\nUh, from great friends now it's no affiliation\nDivided by the time he was facing, once he told me that...\n\nSorry nigga, I'm tryna come home\nSorry nigga, I'm tryna come home\nWell, the walls are talking to me and I know you think I'm wrong\nBut sorry nigga, I'm tryna come home, hey!"}}, {"title": "So Obvious", "album": "Fear of God II: Let Us Pray",

the right hoax\nLet you sing to 'em, emotionally cling to 'em\nWith no pillow, you just sellin' a dream to 'em\nWeakest niggas throwin' shots, I just lean through 'em\nI just laugh at 'em, fuck is he doin'?\n\nI just wanna flip it, I just wanna sell it (3X)\nIt's so obvious; in my clothes you can smell it\n\nTake a glimpse of my life as I walk through it\nPowder everywhere, like I drug the chalk through it\nCatty-corner penthouse as I park-view it\nHit the jackpot; bulls-eye, dart through it\nMusic; I talk through it, it's an art to it\nLet the critics praise, let the charts do it\nAs I burn through this money, no thought to it\n80 cents could save a child, but I ain't opt to it\nI just shop through it; cook and chop to it\nMove Heavy D; I should walk to it\nWe got our own thing; drop the top to it\nThis is block music; Wacka Flock to it\n\n\nI'm so raw, runnin' from the law\nA nigga got rich from what you snort through a straw\nHere to raise the bar; chain, no flaws\nSay it's whiplash when I let my neck thaw\nIn that two-door, no rims on the car\nThe hate is so thick, you can cut it with a saw\nSee what I saw, the best getting better\nLook, but can't touch; I'm a muthafuckin' leper\nQ-dog steppa, Stomp The Yard better\nK-I-L; I'm just waiting on a letter\nOh, there it is; let the triple beam measure\nRe-Up is the gang and we bettin' whatever", "image":

tightrope\nI inspire all the rappers that you might quote\nLookin' down on you niggas like white folk\nYou're entitled to believe all your high hopes\nWhen you can fool anybody with the right hoax\nLet you sing to 'em, emotionally cling to 'em\nWith no pillow, you just sellin' a dream to 'em\nWeakest niggas throwin' shots, I just lean through 'em\nI just laugh at 'em, fuck is he doin'?\n\nI just wanna flip it, I just wanna sell it (3X)\nIt's so obvious; in my clothes you can smell it\n\nTake a glimpse of my life as I walk through it\nPowder everywhere, like I drug the chalk through it\nCatty-corner penthouse as I park-view it\nHit the jackpot; bulls-eye, dart through it\nMusic; I talk through it, it's an art to it\nLet the critics praise, let the charts do it\nAs I burn through this money, no thought to it\n80 cents could save a child, but I ain't opt to it\nI just shop through it; cook and chop to it\nMove Heavy D; I should walk to it\nWe got our own thing; drop the top to it\nThis is block music; Wacka Flock to it\n\n\nI'm so raw, runnin' from the law\nA nigga got rich from what you snort through a straw\nHere to raise the bar; chain, no flaws\nSay it's whiplash when I let my neck thaw\nIn that two-door, no rims on the car\nThe hate is so thick, you can cut it with a saw\nSee what I saw, the best getting better\nLook, but can't touch; I'm a muthafuckin' leper\nQ-dog steppa, Stomp The Yard better\nK-I-L; I'm just waiting on a letter\nOh, there it is; let the triple beam measure\nRe-Up is the gang and we bettin' whatever"}}, {"title": "Speakers Going

free to go\nIt was all good just a key ago\nPrice for the 20 all I need to know\nStill moving snow like it's 3 below\nYou trace hard, while I cake hard\nYou niggas Lil B's to the Based God\nI been cooking, is you mistooken?\nChi town plug got the city jukin'\nGivenchy motorcycle leathers\nMad Max, 5 stacks for a look this weathered\nSmall circle bad bitches all think they clever\nThe mixed ones whole shape and recycle better\nSit them on a curb when I'm done with 'em\nShe oblivious her girl wanna come with 'em\nCan't blame her; other niggas can't run with 'em\nUsain Bolt through these bitches then I'm done with 'em\n\n\nSo Liv\nI picks her up, right?\nShe tells me: Oh I thought I saw you earlier\nThis guy had a Range Rover just like you\nI said Range Rover where? This ain't no motherfuckin Range Rover\nThis a G55; 130 thousand dollars of winter throwaway money\nYou must be out your fucking mind\nSee I could tell you ain't gonna be around long\nYou ain't doing

day\nGrandma praying someday\nBut God can\u2019t hear it over gun play\u00a0\nWoo! Still a target, but the badge is the new noose\nYeah, we all see it, but cellphones ain\u2019t enough proof\nSo we still lose\n\nI say hey, sunshine\nOh how the day can be so long\nI say hey, sunshine\nOh how the day can be so long\n\nI don\u2019t got no march in me, I can\u2019t turn the other cheek\nWhile they testing your patience, they just testing my reach\nFuneral flowers, every 28 hours\nBeing laid over ours\nSworn to protect and serve, but who really got the power?\nLooking over their allowances\u00a0\nBuilding prisons where the mountains is\nLaptops is for the county kids\nMetal detectors is where ours is\nThey\u2019ll never re-write this, like they re-wrote history\nThe fact that the Statue of Liberty was black is a goddamn mystery\nAnd so it goes, every truth don\u2019t get told\nAll these cops get cleared, and lives are stole\nEvery goose don\u2019t lay gold whoa\nJust another nigga dead, just another nigga dead\nSend another to the FEDs, send another to the FEDs\nThey call in the National Guard\nPublic Enemy, I am Chuck D\nFlavor Flav in Louis V, but I\u2019m Huey P\nWoo! The new elite, it\u2019s either you or me\nLet the sunshine, cause their dark clouds try to ruin me\n\nIt\u2019s more and more and more than Baltimore\nFrom shore to shore, oh lord\nPatience torn, patience gone, oh lord\n\nI say hey, sunshine\nOh how the day can be so long\nI say hey, sunshine\nOh how the day can be so long"}}, {"title": "Sure thing - remix", "album": null, "year": null,

everyday to go and get it, get it, get it\n\nCame from the bottom, no one said it would be fair\nNow I'm on this money, lounging like it's a beach chair\nPoppa don't preach, all we do is just reach here\nRaised 'round killers, we just happy to be here\nSpot 'em, got 'em, let your soul pay your dues\nWhile my hoes doing magic, voodoo Moulin Rouge\nThat's a tactic that they use, fuck 'em high then suck 'em dry\nBefore you know it, her Q7 is buzzing by\nThe queen pin to the king pin redeems him\nThe boat comes, the dope drums, my team wins\nYuugh! This the life that we made\nGun shots in the dark like a sweet serenade\n\nCome on, let's toast the champagne, this one's for the life\nDid everything you could to be here for the night\nMan it feels good, everything is right\nEnergy is strong enough to brighten city lights\nMy whole team winning, no vision on quitting\nI'd rather say I did than let them busters say I didn't\nLet 'em talk about it mane, I'm already living\nI risk my life to try everyday to go and get it, get it, get it\n\nSupreme ballers, all my niggas got ESPYs\nTriple doubles, both wrist and neck freeze\nTriple doubles, two bricks and tech squeeze\nTriple doubles, two hoes and check please (Wooo!)\nThey love me on my Ric Flair shit (Wooo!)\nIn that Phantom like I'm Blair Witch (Wooo!)\nWho are you to be compared with? (Wooo!)\nAin't no niggas that you bled with\nCourt cases ran base and road aces\nLick shots or left bodies with no traces\nYuugh!

it's kill-a-ho-nigga season\nI made my way, way, I found my road, road\nBar-arada-da, I made my own, ho\nYUGHHH , you ain\u2019t ever have shit local nigga?\nWoo, how the fuck I owe you local niggas?\nI\u2019m a global nigga, Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es shopper\nLooked up to Eric B and dope dealer, chain rockers\nWhere was you when I was bleeding\nDisappointed and battling my demons\nI just want to ride Italian leather, acting like you don\u2019t know me\nEuro designer palace, fuck my bitch on Missoni\nAnd I feel\u2026\n\nAnd I feel like they want to take my life\nBe careful what you say, be careful what you do\nTell them what they want to hear, but stay from the truth\nAnd I feel like they want to take my life\n\nIt ain\u2019t enough that I struggle through my career\nLess appreciated when I was part of a pair\nPushed an envelope full of truth like I was dared\nDepiction and the depth was the proof that I was there\nIt\u2019s no question in my origins\nPhoto album full of Polaroids they\u2019re still pointing in\nCouple million records sold, still say I\u2019m poisoning\nSeven different SIM cards, bringing all that mortar in\nBrick by brick nigga, all you add is water in\nWe ain\u2019t got to touch hands nigga, put your order in\nI just want to float through clouds Hermes seams on my towels\nNo overly gaudy shit, just the diamonds on the dials\nWoo, and I\u2019m still buying mo\u2019 guns\nMo\u2019 money, mo\u2019 murder nigga, choose one"}}, {"title": "The Games We Play", "album": "DAYTONA", "year": "2018-05-25", "lyrics": "Drug dealer Benzes with gold diggers in 'em\nIn elevator condos, on everything I love\n\nThis ain't a wave or phase, 'cause all that shit fades\nThis lifestyle's forever when you made\nThey tweet about the length I made 'em wait\nWhat the fuck you expect\nWhen a nigga got a cape and he's great?\nOven's full of cakes that he bakes, still spreading paste\nThe love just accentuates the hate\nThis is for my bodybuilding clients moving weight\nJust add water, stir it like a shake\nPlay amongst the stars like the roof in the Wraith\nGet the table next to mine, make our bottle servers race\n\nThese are the games we play, we are the names they say\nThis is the drug money your ex-nigga claim he makes\n\nTo all of my young niggas, I am your Ghost and your Rae\nThis is my Purple Tape, save up for rainy days\nAnd baby mama wishes, along with the side bitches\nThey try to coexist, end up wishing you'd die, bitches\nStood on every couch, in the A at the black party\nNo jewelry on, but you richer than everybody\nYou laugh a little louder, the DJ say your name a little prouder\nAnd we don't need a globe to show you the world is ours\nWe can bet a hundred thousand with my safe hold\nMy numbers lookin' like a bank code\n\nThese are the games we play, we are the names they say\nThis is the drug money your ex-nigga claim he makes\n\nAin't no stoppin' this champagne from poppin'\nThe draws from droppin', the laws from watchin'\nWith Ye back choppin', the cars and the women come with options\nCaviar facials remove the toxins\nThis ain't for the conscious, this is for the mud-made monsters\nWho grew up on legends from outer Yonkers\nInfluenced by niggas straight outta Compton, the scale never lies\nI'm two-point-two incentivised\nIf you ain't energized like the bunny for drug money\nOr been paralyzed by the sight of a drug mummy\nThis ain't really for you, this is for the Goya Montoya\nWho said I couldn't stop, then afforded me all the lawyers\nThe only kingpin who ain't sinkin'\nChess moves, that means my third eye ain't blinkin'\nStay woke, nigga, or get out\nStill pull them whips out, still spread the chips out\nMight buy your bitch some new hips and yank her rib out\nThe message in this music, all my niggas had to live out\n\nThese are the games we play, we are the names they say\nThis is the drug money your ex-nigga claim he makes, yah!", "image":

made\nThey tweet about the length I made 'em wait\nWhat the fuck you expect\nWhen a nigga got a cape and he's great?\nOven's full of cakes that he bakes, still spreading paste\nThe love just accentuates the hate\nThis is for my bodybuilding clients moving weight\nJust add water, stir it like a shake\nPlay amongst the stars like the roof in the Wraith\nGet the table next to mine, make our bottle servers race\n\nThese are the games we play, we are the names they say\nThis is the drug money your ex-nigga claim he makes\n\nTo all of my young niggas, I am your Ghost and your Rae\nThis is my Purple Tape, save up for rainy days\nAnd baby mama wishes, along with the side bitches\nThey try to coexist, end up wishing you'd die, bitches\nStood on every couch, in the A at the black party\nNo jewelry on, but you richer than everybody\nYou laugh a little louder, the DJ say your name a little prouder\nAnd we don't need a globe to show you the world is ours\nWe can bet a hundred thousand with my safe hold\nMy numbers lookin' like a bank code\n\nThese are the games we play, we are the names they say\nThis is the drug money your ex-nigga claim he makes\n\nAin't no stoppin' this champagne from poppin'\nThe draws from droppin', the laws from watchin'\nWith Ye back choppin', the cars and the women come with options\nCaviar facials remove the toxins\nThis ain't for the conscious, this is for the mud-made monsters\nWho grew up on legends from outer Yonkers\nInfluenced by niggas straight outta Compton, the scale never lies\nI'm two-point-two incentivised\nIf you ain't energized like the bunny for drug money\nOr been paralyzed by the sight of a drug mummy\nThis ain't really for you, this is for the Goya Montoya\nWho said I couldn't stop, then afforded me all the lawyers\nThe only kingpin who ain't sinkin'\nChess moves, that means my third eye ain't blinkin'\nStay woke, nigga, or get out\nStill pull them whips out, still spread the chips out\nMight buy your bitch some new hips and yank her rib out\nThe message in this music, all my niggas had to live out\n\nThese are the games we play, we are the names they say\nThis is the drug money your ex-nigga claim he makes, yah!"}},

camouflage when the halo's your disguise\nThem wings don't fly\nYour traitor is your neighbor\nAt your front porch, and he's handing you your paper\nBathrobe on, but the sword's underneath\nAnd he wanna see your blood as it pours in the street\nIt's the mark of the beast\nThe meek shall inherit the Earth\nThe weak shall inherit the dirt\nYou each should have perished at birth\nStill born or aborted\nEvery street tax gotta come with an audit\nEither your life, or your loved ones\nStraight razor or a snub-gun\nFrom the village where the thugs from\nSame corner that you copping all your drugs from\nHe a hero, but he unsung\nI'm the one\n\nAyo homie, the chambers is 36, they new and improved\nNow make a move\nThese guns whistle, sizzle up dudes who got big mouths, no power\nRun in the bank with no dollars, got the nerve to switch crews\nWe better than the rest of 'em, my guess is the estrogen\nAnd all the money we got, we move like the Mexicans\nA cartel, compound, a carvel, a large scale in Scarsdale\nI fuck with golf now, Shala is ill\nYeah, the coke is fresh, straight out of Bermuda yo\nOr chilling on a beach in Boca Chica with tuna\nSalads and palaces, yo, we smoke out them chalices\nPassing of the balances of bread to the Island since\n1984, the blow was just more\nThen we would come trough with rifles rocking Nike boots and war\nA real nigga's invention that came from a henchman\nWho blew up, now throw the Wu up, that's my redemption\n\nDrug dealer, been that nigga half my life\nDrug dealer, been that nigga half my life\nYou niggas talking, but you ain't never seen 'em\nImagine being first name basis with the kingpin\n\nGod, I was Lucifer's neighbor\nYou wouldn't believe some of the things these people do for this paper\nMoving with the lasers under Rugers\nMake a move, you make the papers, lose lose situation\nSweat or blood, you get to choose what you bathe in\nThe chemists cookwork\nThe runners; footwork\nThe custies took work\nThe soldiers put work in\nOn any of the motherfuckers who fucked up good work\nBosses tell 'em: 'Good work'\nThat's just how the hood work\nNorthface bubble with, eight bundles under it\nGold front upper-lip smile while I was hugging it\nI lied, I wasn't Lucifer's neighbor, he who I'm fucking with\nMy moms threw that snow in her nose, but I would hustle it\nChamp hoodie, Mongoose with the pegs\nClap your stoop up, hit moms duke in her legs\nThat's beef nigga, y'all ain't street niggas\nY'all peep niggas, write it down and try to be niggas\nFucking everything, neck heavy swing\nSecond hand swepped across that pretty Breitling\nIn that Nissan, Honda, Chevy thing peddling\nWhatever bring 'fetti in, steadily I fed my whole team\n\n\nIn this art of war, my pen stroke is Picasso\nNiggas get the picture I ain't got to paint the nostrils\nYou know my origins is over when\nFat black bitch singing over organs\nDie for a dollar, pride you don't swallow\nYou save that for the one you buying red bottoms\nYuugh! That's the price you gotta pay for it\nAll's fair in love and war, she masquerade for it\nWoo!

Jean\nYou grown and you sexy, you following the fiend\nThat coconut Ciroc, see that's all we really need\nYou in college now, so you too old to tease\nI hoping you can polish like Pledge what I

the Dream\n\n\nYeah, she claiming that she didn't know\nHow to kiss it like she standing under miseltoe\nMy love game got you feeling so official though\nI let you referee, just let your whistle blow\nI'm never out of bounds, I'm on a higher ground\nI'm never empty handed, coming from out of town\nThe Commes Des Garcons, the Christian Louboutin\nThe J Brand jeans look like you drew 'em on\nI don't deny it, baby I just buy it\nOnce I get the mood right, maybe you should try it\nAlas, I'm past on my past\nI ran like the flash and I saved the best for last\n\n\nSee we can take it slow, or we can take it there\nI'm thinking lap dance and you should take a chair\nWe both give a little, we just play it fair\nYou see this back and forth, for me it's kinda rare\nPut out cards on the table, let's play truth or dare\nLet your hair down, I don\u2019t have you pegged as a square\nJust let loose as you ride in that ruthless\nYou my new girl, you allowed to give me goose neck\nWe don't give a damn, who's watching\nMe slowing down, not an option\nAnd the buck hair's waving in the wind\nYou are such a champ how you take it on the chin", "image":

something, do something\n\nPlease, pretty please\nI just wanna see you down on your pretty knees\nOr maybe you could touch it, see where it leads\nGo 'head, just beat it like you was Billy Jean\nYou grown and you sexy, you following the fiend\nThat coconut Ciroc, see that's all we really need\nYou in college now, so you too old to tease\nI hoping you can polish like Pledge what I need\nAnd I ain't being selfish, we can't call it greed\nCause I return the favour like playing to the screen\nI'm moving too fast, cause just when I believe\nYou came to shut it down like Drake and the Dream\n\n\nYeah, she claiming that she didn't know\nHow to kiss it like she standing under miseltoe\nMy love game got you feeling so official though\nI let you referee, just let your whistle blow\nI'm never out of bounds, I'm on a higher ground\nI'm never empty handed, coming from out of town\nThe Commes Des Garcons, the Christian Louboutin\nThe J Brand jeans look like you drew 'em on\nI don't deny it, baby I just buy it\nOnce I get the mood right, maybe you should try it\nAlas, I'm past on my past\nI ran like the flash and I saved the best for last\n\n\nSee we can take it slow, or we can take it there\nI'm thinking lap dance and you should take a chair\nWe both give a little, we just play it fair\nYou see this back and forth, for me it's kinda rare\nPut out cards on the table, let's play truth or dare\nLet your hair down, I don\u2019t have you pegged as a square\nJust let loose as you ride in that ruthless\nYou my new girl, you allowed to give me goose neck\nWe don't give a damn, who's watching\nMe slowing down, not an option\nAnd the buck hair's waving in the wind\nYou are such a champ how you take it on the chin"}}, {"title": "Trouble", "album": null, "year": null, "lyrics":

you're silly\nThinkin' that this 'preme wasn't free, willy\nThe feeling is neutral, the gang is youthful\nAnd fuckin' tighter than Chad Hugo's pupils, it's Wolf Gang and the\n\nWith the Re-Up's a helluva buzz\nRick James said cocaine's a helluva drug\nWho else could put the hipsters with felons and thugs\nAnd paint a perfect picture of what sellin' it does?\nThis is for the critics, who

in the black house\nStill got the Macs out, pull the mask down like a mascot\nStill trick with bitches, out with money or with ass shots\nGOOD had room for one more, I took the last spot\nRe-Up Gang, P the nigga, 'Ye done hit the jackpot\nWhole 'nother level, then you add fame\nThat's a whole 'nother devil, legit drug dealer\nThat's a whole 'nother bezel, the carbon Audemar\nThat's a whole 'nother metal, but still keep it ghetto\nBehind the scenes, pull strings like Gepetto\nThe gun blow steam, whistle like a tea kettle\nRunnin' like the rebels, UNLV\nSport shoe on a pedal, I let you niggas settle\n\nTrouble on my mind\nI got trouble on my mind\nTrouble on my mind\nSo much trouble on my mind\nTrouble on my mind\nI got trouble on my mind\nTrouble on my mind\nSo much trouble on my mind\n\nPharrell said \"get 'em\", so I got 'em\nTripped on Bristol Palin then I accidentally shot 'em\nThen it ricocheted and killed the game, I'm a problem\nCause I wanna fuck the world but not a fan of using condoms\nPardon my French, I'm going hard as my dick\nWhen I envision my tip on the crust of bitch lips\nMr. Lipschitz has been trippin'\nSince I mentioned Reptar triceratops dinosaur dick\nI feel it in my gut to kill these muthafucks\nIs a must, like the arm of my pits\nYou niggas coming shorter than a Bushwick Billy costume\nOn sale during Christmas in Philly\nUm, well, not really, it's getting kinda chilly\nLet's hit a couple bars and give some bitches wet willies\nSoaked, getting jiggy with it in Bel-Air's richest\nWith a bag of pills, couple berries and a biscuit\n\nTrouble on my mind\nI got trouble on my mind\nTrouble on my mind\nSo much trouble on my mind\n\nI'm a fucking walking paradox\nAnd a really shitty rapper in my favorite pair of socks\nIroned pair of dockers, two Glocks cocked screamin', \"West side!\"\nWith the speakers blastin' a pair of Pacs\nYonkers 10 milli, you're silly\nThinkin' that this 'preme wasn't free, willy\nThe feeling is neutral, the gang is youthful\nAnd fuckin' tighter than Chad Hugo's pupils, it's Wolf Gang and the\n\nWith the Re-Up's a helluva buzz\nRick James said cocaine's a helluva drug\nWho else could put the hipsters with felons and thugs\nAnd paint a perfect picture of what sellin' it does?\nThis is for the critics, who doubted the chemistry\nTwo different worlds, same symmetry\nAnd this black art, see the wizardry when you at the top\nOf your game, you make enemies, you'll never finish me\n\nTrouble on my mind\nI got trouble on my mind\nTrouble on my mind\nSo much trouble on my mind"}}, {"title": "Trust You", "album": "Wrath Of Caine", "year": "2013-01-28", "lyrics": "Ay unno\nMe?

I'm good money\nGot you talking in dollar signs\nIt's all good that she the top bitch\nBut she just wanna know the bottom line\nI don't blame her, I don't change her\nI just sit back and give her options\nPhillip Lim, Derek Lam\nEvery baller gotta know she's sponsored\nWhoo!

make sure you meet all mine\nStanding there staring, with your bow-legged stance\nTrust being nothing you could hold in your hand\nHustle in the hood, strong with the bands\nLook at you as something more than a ho I could smash\nOr being something bad I could bone at the bag\nPole in my pants standing at attention\nWhen you step out of the shower and your ass is wiggling\nGlance at the ceiling\nNow your glass is empty\nThinking backwards, really\nI done grabbed a vixen\nThat supposed to be a fitter after video\nStacks'll really blow\nDancers get exposed\nMissing you when you not around\nWe text each other when out of town\nYou remain the same no matter up or down\nThese other women stay pretending\nMoney come and they help us spend it\nBut'll fuck my niggas in the very minute\nI was down and out and had to go to prison\nKinda high role play, acki\nAnd again I say I like these hoes", "image":

separate myself from you kings of the YouTube\nI am more U2, I am like Bono with the Edge\nIn Mexico, fuck Donald and his pledge\nLegend has it, the wrist is magic\nThe left is Patek, Philippe's replaced by Matsuhisa\nIgnore most requests for the feature\nUnless it\u2019s getting played on the beach in Ibiza\nWhile she fucking Nesha and she sucking shisha\nCan\u2019t you see my Total; Pam, Kima, Keisha\nI\u2019m aiming for the moguls, why y'all niggas aiming at the locals?\nAnd rap niggas broke like them, they\u2019re mere hopeful\nStill wishing on a star\nThe last one to find out that

Music has been announced\nA quarter million a year and that don\u2019t bounce\nI\u2019m in the score of these movies, I\u2019m losing count\nMu, you knew me from thirteen hundred an ounce\nMy breakdown game bought me \u20188 Mile\u2019 fame\nSelling Eminem to him and \u2018em\nWhite to the Blacks I\u2019m a villain in\nThe Rolls Royce, playing peek-a-boo with the emblem\nLet\u2019s talk about it gentlemen\nMy barcode is Netflix \u201cNarcos\u201d\nPart on the side of my 'fro like I\u2019m Pablo\nNo hablo, I sell blow\nLone wolf, no Tonto, head honcho\nYuugh, let\u2019s take the scenic route\nI could show you the strange fruit\nIt\u2019s looking like Beirut\nThey open the wash bay, I climb it like K2\nThese kilos are drought killers, I flooded the Jes\u00fas, I made use\nOf every Spanish name I done ran across\nNo matter what the weight, I done ran it off\nI\u2019m walking on water, I took the sandals off\nTell A&E to turn the cameras off, Push\n\nUntouchable, uncrushable\nBlunted in a 600, blunted in a 600\nUntouchable, uncrushable\nBlunted in a 600, blunted in a 600"}}, {"title": "What Do You Take Me For", "album": null, "year": null, "lyrics": "(PIXIE LOTT feat.

under sweats\nA hundred just landed from responding to a text\nNiggas talk money but I\u2019m still unimpressed\nWhen these thousand dollar sneakers got me feeling underdressed\nHip Hop bores me, hustlers applaud me\nToo much school boy, not enough rude boy\nNothing match the feeling of pulling up in that new toy\nAnd it ain't even half of my safe, tuck like the Jew boy\nBentley with the rag-top yarmulke\nIt says kilometers all on my speedometer\nCocaine under my tongue like thermometer\nI got the fever, I never took a breather\nNeed a way out like Nas needed an Ether\nLike Mike Vick chased by PETA\nMore pony hairs, more zebras\nMore pythons, more lizards\n\nYou niggas gettin' money, I never hear about it\nThe bricks fell, I skip jail, live to tell about it\nI\u2019m what dreams
