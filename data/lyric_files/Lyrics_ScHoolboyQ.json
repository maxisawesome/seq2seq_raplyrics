do it for your kids\nMy nigga won't you tell Michelle, I love your daughter\nPlease dont let her grow up life without a father\nLook at what you bought her, money couldn't buy\nAll she need is love, put that shit aside\nAt the same time know they got to eat\nKnow you got to hustle, make ends meet\nGotta make time, gotta get a grind, gotta push the line, HTC, no a.c\nAnd the block hot, you keep runnin', cop say freeze\nBlue pill, red pill, choose now, birds or the beez\n\nBirds and the beez\nBirds and the beez\n\nTired of the same ol' shit, niggas they faking it\nNiggas out here living foul\nBetter yet they flagrant, keep these niggas right up out the game\nKeep these niggas right up out my lane\nI just wanna do this fucking music boy, leave this dope alone and count my change\n\nCount my change\nCount my change"}}, {"title": "Black THougHts", "album": "Blank Face LP", "year": "2016-07-08", "lyrics": "Our experience to where we have parents in our lives that were

everything\nLike didn't nobody walk us, our hand and show love like you do this and don't do that\nIt wasn't like that coming up in our mothafuckin' community. We grew up off of cigarillos... we grew up off of second row, acting like them\nA worldwide blade, a real strength....\n\nYeah that's on the regular\nSmokin' the gas on the regular, man\nKnow what I mean\nWord\nSippin' on Hen, that's the regular\nKnow what I mean\n\nPissy sofas, sharin' food with roaches, uh\nOn gangsta Crip, my poppa was a bitch\nLeft me where hope just don't exist\nAnd every neighbor got a fence\nWith bars on windows, my mom's slavin' for the rent\nThrowin' dices, GT Dyno groovin'\nWhere you hang, we shootin'\nYou slip, we stiffin'\nCreative Crippin', uh\nBitches stoppin' traffic\nThis the type of shit that make the MAC a classic\nReason I'm a pussy magnet\nShe learned to carry package\nI been the best at rappin', uh\nI'm hot as Vegas\nYour favorite rapper broke, he don't get this paper\nBut claim he got a kilo, been born in '93 though\nHe tryna fool the people\nMaaaaaan\n\nThe joke's on you, mothafucka\nThe loc is on you, mothafucka\nI warned you, it's karma\nBlack thoughts and marijuana, it's karma\nBlack thoughts and marijuana, it's karma\nBlack thoughts and marijuana, it's karma\n\nAin't nothin' changed but the change\nLet's put our brains away from gangs\nCrips and Bloods the old and new slaves\nShit we even changed our names\nTiny somethin' Lil Shane while we bang\nBut yo, y'all ain't hearin' me\nMy homie facin' life, told me that my pride my biggest enemy\nBut you keep your eyes in that dark\nYour mind, it greys your heart\nI wrote these rhymes days apart\nMost of us caught before we can expand our thoughts\nHow your grandmother see your corpse?\nHow your big homie make your life a book?\nLeft you for dead cause he ain't lead you, right\nBut I'm gon' freedom write\nLet's put the rags down and raise our kids\nLet's put the guns down and blaze a spliff\nLet's do it now, ain't no buts or ifs\nIt took a Blood to get me Pringle chips\nYou can learn to fly or take the ladder\nReal nigga shit, all lives matter, both sides\nMaaaaaan\n\nThe joke's on you, mothafucka\nThe loc is on you, mothafucka\nI warned you, it's karma\nBlack thoughts and marijuana, it's karma\nBlack thoughts and marijuana, it's karma\nBlack thoughts and marijuana, it's karma"}}, {"title": "Blank Face", "album": "Blank Face LP", "year": "2016-07-08", "lyrics": "Who you tellin'?\nBlank faces\n\nSmokers and dope fiends, hookers and

25\nDancin' with devils, never knew how to treat your woman right\nFeet on the pedal runnin' over jokers and funny tops\nWord to my OG, he gone, that nigga fresh out of strikes\nI should know better, heaven knows that I ain\u2019t the dummy type, nah\nI should be flyin' home without a care\nMy baby don\u2019t want no toys, she want me there\nI trade the noise for a piece of divine\nI savor my coins for a piece of the land\nSomething to pass while I'm passin' my prime\nMy word in the cards, full deck in my hand\nAs sure as the smog is pollutin' the land\nBe what you wanna be as long as you get the money right, yeah\n\nWise as my Chevy\nMy life\u2019s so fucked up the drank don\u2019t get me buzzed\nWe ain\u2019t blood and they killed my cous'\nChuckin' Cs since I was a cub\nYoung nigga

me stay in school, my dream was just a small percentage\nSaid a million wasn\u2019t realistic\nLast year I spent it, what\u2019s the laws of physics?\nMove pounds or move down to Section 8 livin'\nGrew up around Crippin', woo business\n\nAnd if I never make it to 25 I swear to God I\u2019m still gon' fly, nigga\nBut it\u2019s still my time, nigga\nTell me who gon' fly with

playas\nDope in the vein, young'ns servin' the meds\nRun from the police, jump from the ledge\nBe what you wanna be as long as you get the money right\nNiggas don\u2019t understand until you leap over 25\nDancin' with devils, never knew how to treat your woman right\nFeet on the pedal runnin' over jokers and funny tops\nWord to my OG, he gone, that nigga fresh out of strikes\nI should know better, heaven knows that I ain\u2019t the dummy type, nah\nI should be flyin' home without a care\nMy baby don\u2019t want no toys, she want me there\nI trade the noise for a piece of divine\nI savor my coins for a piece of the land\nSomething to pass while I'm passin' my prime\nMy word in the cards, full deck in my hand\nAs sure as the smog is pollutin' the land\nBe what you wanna be as long as you get the money right, yeah\n\nWise as my Chevy\nMy life\u2019s so fucked up the drank don\u2019t get me buzzed\nWe ain\u2019t blood and they killed my cous'\nChuckin' Cs since I was a cub\nYoung nigga grew up on hate but where\u2019s the love?\nAsh and dubs on\n\nNiggas don\u2019t understand until you leap over 25\nDancin' with devils\nGuess you would say I'm one of the lucky type\nNo\u2014fuck you thought?\n\nPlayin' tooth fairy, Santa before I\u2019m buried\nEaster egg huntin', pickin' seeds out the pumpkin\nSix years straight the valentine for my munchkin\nI made a queen outta nothin'\nTold me stay in school, my dream was just a small percentage\nSaid a million wasn\u2019t realistic\nLast year I spent it, what\u2019s the laws of physics?\nMove pounds or move down to Section 8 livin'\nGrew up around Crippin', woo business\n\nAnd if I never make it to 25 I swear to God I\u2019m still gon' fly, nigga\nBut it\u2019s still my time, nigga\nTell me who gon' fly with me?\nYeah!\nWho gon' ride with ya?\nWho gon' fly with ya?\nIt\u2019s still my time, yeah\nIt\u2019s still my time, nigga, yeah"}}, {"title": "Blank Face LP [Booklet]", "album": "Blank Face LP",

nigga\n\nOne's for the money, two for the bitches\nThree to get ready cause I feel I finally did it\nFour's for the jealous rapper mad because he finished\nTurn that mothafucka to a critic\nMan, I got so much shit up on my plate, dog\nI was hanging on them corners late\nPockets wasn't straight, bitch\nI ain't gon' make it at this rate, dog, know what I'm saying?\nNigga praying up to God just hoping that he hear a nigga\nI know the world got more problems and it's much bigger\nBut I figured, I'd get some shit up off my chest\nTo all my niggas I would die for, load my pistol up, go out and war for\nTo all my niggas that'll never make it out the streets\nFuck it, keep goin' hard, don't let 'em see you weak\nTo all my niggas first time stepping in the pen\nRead a book and exercise, keep your spirit in\nTo all my niggas that's gon' fuck around and die today\nTake our hats off, bow our heads and let us pray, just wanna say\n\nStay blessed my nigga, blessed my nigga\nReally think about it, could be worse my nigga\nDon't stress my nigga, yes, my nigga\nWe all blessed my nigga\n\nNow how the fuck I'm 'posed to say this?\nYou see my nigga just lost his son\nWhile I'm here hugging on my daughter, I grip her harder\nKiss her on the head as I cry for a bit\nThinking of some bullshit to tell him\nLike \"It'll be okay, you'll be straight, it'll be aight\"\nWell, fuck that shit\nWhatever you need, yo, I got it!\nWhether it's money or some weed or putting in work\nFuck it, then I'm riding\nYou know what's up, but now a nigga couldn't stick around\nTold myself that after y'all moved\nThat I'd be a fuckin' fool, to be living by the street rules\n\"Fuck police\" tattoos, that happens when you ditch school\nBut anyway, keep the faith\nStay strong, bruh, remain solid, bruh\nKeep playing ball, cuz\nIt's the only way up out it, bruh, a nigga proud of ya\nTell Floyd to enjoy his newborn seed\nI'll have whatever he needs, we the last of a dying breed\nLive life, smoke trees\nSee how far we've come but most, I'm sorry for your son\n\nStay blessed my nigga, blessed my nigga\nReally think about it, could be worse my nigga\nDon't stress my nigga, yes, my nigga\nWe all blessed my nigga\n\nAnd you ain't gotta shed no tear\nI'll be everywhere and I'mma always be right here\nI ain't forgot those years\nI'll be everywhere but I'mma always be right here\n\nLiving in a premature place... wait\nNever grow to see the pearly gates... break\nEvery time a bullet detonate... dates... of obituary carry crates\nOf a scary picture with a family member that relate to ya\nIn December you was finna pin another case\nOn your record in a stolen Expedition, play it safe\nAs the record spinning, you was hearing angels entertain\nEvery pun intended, that was wicked, coming from your brain\nRecognize you listened and you didn't hit the block again\nThat's because the minute after you had knew you would be slain\nOpen up another chapter in the book and read 'gain\nStory of a gun-clapper really tryna make a change\nEverybody ain't blessed, my nigga\nYes, my nigga, you're blessed, take advantage, do your best, my nigga\nDon't stress, you was granted everything inside this planet\nAnything you imagine, you possess, my nigga\nYou reject these niggas that neglect your respect\nFor the progress of a baby step, my nigga\nStep-step my nigga, one, two, skip-skip\nBack-back, look both ways, pull it off the hip\nBlast at anybody say that you can't flip\nThis crack into rap music every other zip is a track\nGet used to it, get it off quick\nCome back, give back to the city you've built\nThat's that, don't trip, see money, fuck niggas, dog\nIt ain't nothing but a bunch of fuck niggas, dog\nIn a minute everybody gon' be winning\nPut a little faith in it then recognize that we all\n\nStay blessed my nigga, blessed my nigga\nReally think about it, could be worse my nigga\nDon't stress my nigga, yes, my nigga\nWe all blessed my nigga"}}, {"title": "Blind Threats",

the valley of the shadow of death, no rules, right\n\nWashing my sins off in hell's water\nFeel like the Bible told me lies as I pray to 'em\nKneel down, put my faith in 'em, will you answer me?\n\nBut if God won't help me, this gun will\nI swear I'm gon' find my way\n\nUh, four corners\nCat and mouse chase, got cheese to catch\nHigh on on some drug, I'm Space Cadet\nDreaming I don't live up on the block no more\nTrapping, trying to make it out this obstacle\nLife on the edge, hell a block away\nPretty Snow White turned eight today\nSelling that base, no Dr. Dre\nUh, guess who in the building?\nBucket hat with a strap like a pilgrim\nUh, kneeling down with some questions to address like\nWhy the ones who commit the worst sins live the best?\nThe Ten Commandments, I can mark five checks\nBut I sense flaws, the Bible preaching blind threats\nStreets held me down, got faith in a Pyrex\nFaith in a four-five, I call it the clarinet\nSewer full of drugs when the toilet digests\nFrom the cop raid, all can relate from the streets\nTo the wall from niggas to compadres\nWhen the sun go down, I'm predicting a heatwave\nForecast your whole body, heat on, room full of homies\nI just pray that the Lord got me\n\nBut if God won't help me, this gun will\nI swear I'm gon' find my way\n\nMic check, mic check, mic check\nLa-la, la-la, low-low, la-la, la-la, low\nLa-la, la-la, low-low, la-la, la-la, low\n\nBut if God won't help me, this gun will\nI swear I'm gon' find my way\n\nAim that, shoot that, pledge allegiance\nKill mine, kill yours, make it even\nSoul need saving, Mr. Preacher\nI know I only come around when it's Easter\nFunerals, Thanksgiving, Christmas time\nWhen I'm in jail or when my card declined\nUh, will you answer me?\nTake me out of hell and make plans for me?\nMisery loves company, ain't a surprise\nIt was just me and my niggas, we was trying to survive\nBut we would never make it out alive\nShit, we living to die\u2014oxymoron\nHope to get to heaven 'til that day arrive\nRunning through the ally, hope the bullet don't collide\nCar window shattered, glass on my right side\nDogs bark in the backyard, root for me\nOut of shape belly, courtesy of 40\nSpoiled only child, baby boy Jody\nSame jacket on from back in the day\nPraying that the Lord come and take me away\n\nBut if God won't help me, this gun will\nI swear I'm gon' find my

way\n\nAyo, tuna fish sandwiches bread, dry and stinking\nBlack Lincoln, burgundy Mac, I clap a king-pin\nCaught me in the airport dusted that I was thinking\nOn how to stay rich and get bills with my acquaintances\nYeah, money is the issue, I diss you\nIt's no problem at all, yo, the bunch on the pistol\nCause I'm a suitcase king\nCooling at the gambling spot with a screwed face grin\nNew Beige Bent, we stay winning, play it again, yo\nPut the bone in your jaw, now say it again\nRound nightfall under the tents, coming to rinse\nGet out the way or let the shotty dispense\nRevenge killers who make the events iller\nThis is more realer, snatch you right up out of the Benz\nThe Wu wheelers who huddle up, coupes knows the truth\nYou know the whoopty-whoop, solo or group, I kill niggas",

no rules, right\n\nWashing my sins off in hell's water\nFeel like the Bible told me lies as I pray to 'em\nKneel down, put my faith in 'em, will you answer me?\n\nBut if God won't help me, this gun will\nI swear I'm gon' find my way\n\nUh, four corners\nCat and mouse chase, got cheese to catch\nHigh on on some drug, I'm Space Cadet\nDreaming I don't live up on the block no more\nTrapping, trying to make it out this obstacle\nLife on the edge, hell a block away\nPretty Snow White turned eight today\nSelling that base, no Dr. Dre\nUh, guess who in the building?\nBucket hat with a strap like a pilgrim\nUh, kneeling down with some questions to address like\nWhy the ones who commit the worst sins live the best?\nThe Ten Commandments, I can mark five checks\nBut I sense flaws, the Bible preaching blind threats\nStreets held me down, got faith in a Pyrex\nFaith in a four-five, I call it the clarinet\nSewer full of drugs when the toilet digests\nFrom the cop raid, all can relate from the streets\nTo the wall from niggas to compadres\nWhen the sun go down, I'm predicting a heatwave\nForecast your whole body, heat on, room full of homies\nI just pray that the Lord got me\n\nBut if God won't help me, this gun will\nI swear I'm gon' find my way\n\nMic check, mic check, mic check\nLa-la, la-la, low-low, la-la, la-la, low\nLa-la, la-la, low-low, la-la, la-la, low\n\nBut if God won't help me, this gun will\nI swear I'm gon' find my way\n\nAim that, shoot that, pledge allegiance\nKill mine, kill yours, make it even\nSoul need saving, Mr. Preacher\nI know I only come around when it's Easter\nFunerals, Thanksgiving, Christmas time\nWhen I'm in jail or when my card declined\nUh, will you answer me?\nTake me out of hell and make plans for me?\nMisery loves company, ain't a surprise\nIt was just me and my niggas, we was trying to survive\nBut we would never make it out alive\nShit, we living to die\u2014oxymoron\nHope to get to heaven 'til that day arrive\nRunning through the ally, hope the bullet don't collide\nCar window shattered, glass on my right side\nDogs bark in the backyard, root for me\nOut of shape belly, courtesy of 40\nSpoiled only child, baby boy Jody\nSame jacket on from back in the day\nPraying that the Lord come and take me away\n\nBut if God won't help me, this gun will\nI swear I'm gon' find my way\n\nMic check, mic check, mic check\nLa-la, la-la, low-low, la-la, la-la, low\nLa-la, la-la, low-low, la-la, la-la, low\n\nBut if God won't help me, this gun will\nI swear I'm gon' find my way\n\nAyo, tuna fish sandwiches bread, dry and stinking\nBlack Lincoln, burgundy Mac, I clap a king-pin\nCaught me in the airport dusted that I was thinking\nOn how to stay rich and get bills with my acquaintances\nYeah, money is the issue, I diss you\nIt's no problem at all, yo, the bunch on the pistol\nCause I'm a suitcase king\nCooling at the gambling spot with a screwed face grin\nNew Beige Bent, we stay winning, play it again, yo\nPut the bone in your jaw, now say it again\nRound nightfall under the tents, coming to rinse\nGet out the way or let the shotty dispense\nRevenge killers who make the events iller\nThis is more realer, snatch you right up out of the Benz\nThe Wu wheelers who huddle up, coupes knows the truth\nYou know the whoopty-whoop, solo or group, I kill niggas"}}, {"title": "Bonita", "album":

pigs, I bust back, learned that from Deuce rap\nPeanut and B-loon, had gats before racks\nWay 'fore I found rap, bitch, I had them things wrapped\nAstro on my cap, this shot ain't no phone app\nChucks

I'm doin', long way from grooving\nBitch call me 2 Chainz, units be moving\nGo hard for my Joy, so she don't need no boy\nSmile stay on her face, big room with her own space\nUp all night, the hard

my bread first\nGetMine my nickname, O-X and cocaine\nNina my new thing, blew up before fame\nHeart filled with octane, fire in my soul\nBurn through my shoestring, came up from boosting\nDu-rags and flatlines, drive-bys at bedtime\nGet down, I heard mom, someone lost they grandson\nThank God that I'm straight, no wonder my mom prayed\nLost one of my cuzzos, cursed from them devils\nGood weed and me time, goodbye to Nissan\nCause one day this rappin' gon' pay\n\nSo now we 'bout to break the bank\nMoney be on my mind\nNiggas talkin' 'bout, soundin' like\nLa-da-di-do, la-di-da-di-da-di-do\nNow

concrete\nSurprised I got teeth, my lungs inhale keef\nPeyote with THC, swinging for the fence\nI hope I make it out the park, where the baseheads slide\nAfter dark, where the bangers get caught\nHid the gun in the trees, arrest me by the court\nI just wanna smoke weed and sip lean by the quart, for real\nGood weed, I hit that, crack rock, I sold that\nOxy, I hid that, right by my nutsack\nFuck pigs, I bust back, learned that from Deuce rap\nPeanut and B-loon, had gats before racks\nWay 'fore I found rap, bitch, I had them things wrapped\nAstro on my cap, this shot ain't no phone app\nChucks on my young heel, make sure that my sag ill\nLearn my set trip grill, trade in my big wheel\nGood grades and skipped school, this life gon' catch up soon\nSure 'nough that shit did, twenty-year-old kid\nGot off my behind, write me some sweet lines\nCause one day my story gon' pay\n\nSo now we 'bout to break the bank\nMoney be on my mind\nNiggas talkin' 'bout, soundin' like\nLa-da-di-do,

the honey\nRain, sleet, snow, 'bout the money\nOn Figueroa, close your eyes, might need ya mommy\n\nFuck rap, my shit real, came up off them pills\nHustle for my meal, grindin' for my deal\nLove how I'm doin', long way from grooving\nBitch call me 2 Chainz, units be moving\nGo hard for my Joy, so she don't need no boy\nSmile stay on her face, big room with her own space\nUp all night, the hard way, don't care if it take all day\nI let y'all fucks parler, you wonder why I'm straight\nNew shoes and sick clothes, bitches be front row\nBow down her temple, I don't know her info\nThrew up my

Swear, you don't compare, get your shit repaired\nBurn up out my underwear, bitch, I dropped thirty on \u2018em, Kobe LeBronin em\nGripping my balls I'm palmin' them, feeling myself, move around but I'm rewinding them\nTalky mouth, we pounding them, media ripped in 3 in your clamydia burning, you should've learned your lesson\nWhy would you play with fire, you and your crew can get expired\nNigga you're tired, go to sleep, got his ass seran wrapped, yeah\nLyrical shraps beating black and blue, you nincompoop, 007, Glock in my suit\nOrange top, orange Chucks, pockets Hooved up, twist up, pulled up some screaming we show\nWe show the promoter too\nStill do what I came to do, bottle after bottle like I got in advance\nWent from shittin' in cans to threesomes in sedans, it's part of my plan, the moment I feel like I made it\nGetting half the bitches that said I was over rated\nNow I'm the latest, call me the greatest, one of her favorites, I raised her\nShe say we famous, this rappin' be do or die, there\u2019s a difference between you and I\nFuck a unity, truancy, bitch, never here when we was workin' hard but won an applaud, stunt a nigga that take care of you, should have been abroad\nWe brought your pussy now bow down to the greats, the hardest and human race\nDon't make me humiliate, yeah, yeah, yeah\nAnd put the names out there you best have clear, you're pressed out here\nSlide me the weapon, pop your recession, your valuable lesson\n\nMy nigga's flammable, we all on fire, we all on fire\nMy nigga's flammable, we all on fire, we all on fire\nTell me what you can but I tell you what you can't do\nTouch a hundred grand well that's something what you can't do\nSay up in the man well that's something what you can't do\nAnother hundred grand well that's something that you can't do\nI tell what you can do\n\nClash with these titans, burners without license\nSee them B's and them H's, that\u2019s priceless\nQ told me, \u2018Go brazy\u2019 and brazy, that\u2019s my shit\nI\u2019m the shit\u2019, she tell me, sippin' Hennessy with your bitch\nNow she say baby be going crazy for the dick, wow\nKing Kong knock them down, back to back, ping pong\nFast lane, fast money, you for the fame you crash dummy\nNiggas get beside theyselves, steppin' outside theyselves\nTell them get a reality check they say rock is the best\nThe shit that smoke the some in the pipe, I'm worser than that\nMore like a nuclear bomb in the trap, Saddam in the flesh\nThe effect is like dominos, when we drop niggers falling like Geronimo\nLet \u2018em suffer, we bring the ruckus, flow funky like the shit on the shingle\nGot your numbers if you yelling bingo\nOn fire like skillets in Hell\u2019s Kitchen, get your jewels missing for starting backwards\n12 gauge pump action, we smashing in grand nationals kill capital collateral damages\nOvercome challenges, digging your bitch they gonna toss that hoe to my managers\nWe're scandalous\n\nMy nigga's flammable, we all on fire, we all on fire\nMy nigga's flammable, we all on fire, we all on fire\nTell me what you can but I tell you what you can't do\nTouch a hundred grand well that's something what you can't do\nSay up in

I'm blazin', life's so amazin'\nHoes like I'm lacin', broads I'm replacin'\nMurder competition, I'm talkin' all editions\nI'm just doin' mixtapes to keep my repetition\nIt's Q, Quincy Hanley to be exact\nIt's not another rapper that's better and this is fact\nThe main attraction, action\nThese rappers say they not actin', I beg to differ\nI smoked a piffer, I drink the liquor\nMixed with the Henney, mixed with the Remy\nMixed with the vodka, body intoxi-cated\nFaded, niggas they hate it\nBecause I'm shittin' on 'em, these rappers constipated\nSo don't betray it, I keep it doin' how I'm doin'\nStill pursuin' every dream for my team\nI just seen him servin' fiends with this hip-hop crack rock\nStudio's the crack spot\nJumpin' out the track pot, lyrics make the water get hot\nI keep it movin', I keep it groovin'\nI keep 'em open, they body soakin', my body pokin'\nI stay emotion, but not the picture\nVery soon they'll bring hip-hop back up-to-date and can't wait\n\nI optimize out of

25\nNo age, December days, up and away I go\nTake more money, overdose\nIf you don't, then you they will take plenty from\nDumb to niggas and debate off a drum\n'Yum' to bitches that be givin' up the puss to me\nTyga, man, flyer than the next\nHey, I bring figures out, you ain't got to guess\nS on my chest, don't relate Superman\nYSL, price high as hell, God damn, damn\nJust lampin', future

That young Nip, 50\nThat Bill Crispy, the Benjamin\nThese niggas softer than a cinnamon roll\nAs I compose, my body arose up from the dead\nEvery since Nas dropped that one album\nPut his flow over my corpse, I came up with a torch\nHit the studio and comin' with force, yep, kaboom\nGuess who stepped in the room?\nNigga been a nut since I shot in the womb\nI blow like balloon, thank you guys for some of your time\nTop five, nigga, dead or alive, Q"}}, {"title": "Collard Greens", "album": "Oxymoron", "year": "2014-02-25", "lyrics": "Oh, oh, luxury\nChidi-ching-ching, could buy anything, cop that\nOh, oh, collard greens\nThree degrees low, make it hot for me, drop that\nOh, oh, down with that shit\nDrink this, smoke this, get down with the shit\nHey, oh, oh, down with the shit\nCop this, pop this, down with the shit\n\nSmoke this, drink this, straight to my liver\nWatch this, no tick, yeah, I'm the nigga\nGang rap, X-mas, smoke, shots I deliver\nFaded, Vegas, might sponsor the killer\nShake it, break it, hot-hot for the winter\nDrop it, cop it, eyes locked on your inner object\nRock it, blast-blast, new beginnings\nLovely, pinky how not I remember, fiendin'\nGive me, give me, give me some\nFreak the freckles off your face\nFrenchy, freakin', swappin' tongue\nClick my link and spread your buns\nLose your denim, make it numb\nBlow it, baby, no Saddam (Icky-icky, icky-icky)\nFuckin' in the car service, thank me for the car pool\nChromosome, part full, probly off a Norco\nAnd gas, not the Arco, poppin' since the intro\nYou shoppin' from the window, play my favorite tempo\n\nOh, oh, luxury\nChidi-ching-ching, could buy anything, cop that\nOh, oh, collard greens\nThree degrees low, make it hot for me, drop that\nOh, oh, down with that shit\nDrink this, smoke this, get down with the shit\nHey, oh, oh, down with the shit\nCop this, pop this, down with the shit\n\nHold up, biatch..!

he on his ass\nHuffing and puffing, getting tagged\nSee what this nigga feel, would only make them niggas laugh\nHe felt the discomfort, ain't trust them right away\nSaw the devil in they eyes, his homie looking straight\nBut something was different in him, not the same from yesterday, shit\nHis whole demeanor changed, even his smile was strange, his childhood\nNever came, but dude was always gutter, he got it from his brother\nFrom his brother from his brother, brought pain onto his mother\nOnce was elementary homies but now we attack each other\nShit set love aside, took his pride, shit he had to ride\nThrew on his hood and then he fired\nFired and fired, fired and fired, the tires screech\nSpirit of up out of reach, a young nigga's swallowing yeast\nTrapped in the belly of the beast, sheesh\n\nI know niggas, that kill niggas, that kill niggas, that kill niggas, that kill niggas\nThe cycle continues, the cycle continues (Kill nigga, Kill nigga)\n\nHe only 17, his homies was his motive\nHe only 17, his momma never noticed\nToo busy paying bills, tryna provide a meal\nPay the rent and steal, her child live for a thrill\nFulfill his niggas wishes, no more hugs and kisses\nNo more \"How you been,\" no more tucking in\nHe with them other men, poppa never came\nSo his cousin dem would pretend, imitating if they was him\nGot the pistol on him, loaded, loaded off of gin\nFeels like niggas on him, so he look for them\nFirst nigga wrong hat? Blam-blam to him\nParanoia kills, kill or be killed\nLet alone all them thugs, let alone all them drugs\nTreat his kind like a bud, let's see how karma does\nLet's see how much he loves, shoot him up, shoot him up, bam-bam\n\n\nThis nigga 21, he feel like he the man\nThis nigga 21, his mom said \"be a man\"\nLove to sag his pants, pistol in his hand\nFeel he too advanced, him slipping out his chance\nThink he at his best, he hit the set he making orders\nGot them little niggas busting shots and flipping quarters\nAn ounce, a half, double up, shit what you order\nEven dimes, think with a corrupted mind\nAdapted to them crimes, living with regrets\nIn order to survive, gotta get high\nCautious with time, paranoia hard through his body\nTrying love for a hobby, you know gangsters come with kids\nTeaching them wasn't his\nEBT the corner store, he go fill up the fridge\nApproached by a little nigga, hoodie over his lid, looking down a barrel\nOf a burner tucked, aimed at his wig, let him fire, then he fire"}}, {"title": "Dead Rappers", "album": "ScHoolboy Turned Hustla", "year": "2008-07-29", "lyrics": "Hey , yo\nGuess who's bizack still hit a crack him off loads\nCocaine spit throat be the stove\nStay running on these tracks and the mic be the soles\nBe cautious real spitters so you might get exposed\nCopycats spitting all these facts\nWithout your life attached not understanding where your life is at\nYou got your boy confused though I'm not convinced\nWould tell you washed up, but your flow is drenched\nLet me clear my throat let me spit these quotes\nAnd tell you Q, Jay Rock, Dot, we run the coast\nI'm so addicted, and so is Lifted\nSo restricted, now your flow evicted\nFake niggas see through you like eyelashes\nEyeglasses like Kobe nigga, no passes\nMy breed, knowing that you can't make 'em\nYou can't break 'em, so peace As-salamu alaykum\n\nGoodbye, I know the rapper dead\nI'm on my murder job again in the morning\nThis 187 on the line I know the rapper dead\nThat means another record label is mourning\nSo you can run but you cannot hide\nCause when I see 'em I'mma kill 'em\nWhen I see 'em I'mma kill 'em\nMortician got a feeling with embalming fluid\nCause when I see 'em I'mma kill 'em\nWhen I see 'em I'mma kill 'em\nLyrical homicide best believe I do\n\nYo Q, these niggas think they cute\nTalking louder than the trumpet, when I see 'em where the fluke?\nYour opinion something moving like pew pass by 'em, hog tie 'em For the revenue, bullets peer through the bulletproof\nLook what the iron do scope now I'm eyeing you\nSilencer, now my iron grew I en route\nLearn, of the flow first to realize these rap guys\nShit on 'em then throw them to the flies bombs like Al-Ca-ter\nRide on my enemies, homicide\nText like a referee, give you free shot for any penalty\nDrop metaphors, nouns and verbs plenty similes\nServe like a waitress and you don't want seconds courtesy\nOff K Dot, the son of 2Pac\nBiggies nephew Big L said I was special,\nNow let's do, lunch over these beats\nEven Punch said I was sweet\nPunchlines and kick hot rhymes 'till I'm burning my feet\nOuch\n\n\nWait I got it uh known for spitting knowledge uh\nHomages like tuition, they pay it like it's college uh\nWait professor uh, well how I spit it this semester\nLook I'm sending MC's on a stretcher\nThese bitches uh, all because my lyrical conversation\nGot these bitches begging for penetration\nHumiliation, Rappers they will know I demolish ya\nSpit you to a coma Dot finish 'em\n\nUh, wait, Diminish ya preach like a ministerCompetition naw they pussy get the \nGet in the ass like animals imitators get plenty of\nPropane, hotter when winter come, some insane\nDope mane, bee's the studio, You ain't lived here\nEver since I done came, record me yoooo\nYour own momma wouldn't do that\nShe rather throw herself in the dumpster than listen to trash", "image": "https://images.genius.com/72de999ec4144de78b4aca2000e5694f.500x500x1.jpg",

spit throat be the stove\nStay running on these tracks and the mic be the soles\nBe cautious real spitters so you might get exposed\nCopycats spitting all these facts\nWithout your life attached not understanding where your life is at\nYou got your boy confused though I'm not convinced\nWould tell you washed up, but your flow is drenched\nLet me clear my throat let me spit these quotes\nAnd tell you Q, Jay Rock, Dot, we run the coast\nI'm so addicted, and so is Lifted\nSo restricted, now your flow evicted\nFake niggas see through you like eyelashes\nEyeglasses like Kobe nigga, no passes\nMy breed, knowing that you can't make 'em\nYou can't break 'em, so peace As-salamu alaykum\n\nGoodbye, I know the rapper dead\nI'm on my murder job again in the morning\nThis 187 on the line I know the rapper dead\nThat means another record label is mourning\nSo you can run but you cannot hide\nCause when I see 'em I'mma kill 'em\nWhen I see 'em I'mma kill 'em\nMortician got a feeling with embalming fluid\nCause when I see 'em I'mma kill 'em\nWhen I see 'em I'mma kill 'em\nLyrical homicide best believe I do\n\nYo Q, these niggas think they cute\nTalking louder than the trumpet, when I see 'em where the fluke?\nYour opinion something moving like pew pass by 'em, hog tie 'em For the revenue, bullets peer through the bulletproof\nLook what the iron do scope now I'm eyeing you\nSilencer, now my iron grew I en route\nLearn, of the flow first to realize these rap guys\nShit on 'em then throw them to the flies bombs like Al-Ca-ter\nRide on my enemies, homicide\nText like a referee, give you free shot for any penalty\nDrop metaphors, nouns and verbs plenty similes\nServe like a waitress and you don't want seconds courtesy\nOff K Dot, the son of 2Pac\nBiggies nephew Big L said I was special,\nNow let's do, lunch over these beats\nEven Punch said I was sweet\nPunchlines and kick hot rhymes 'till I'm burning my feet\nOuch\n\n\nWait I got it uh known for spitting knowledge uh\nHomages like tuition, they pay it like it's college uh\nWait professor uh, well how I spit it this semester\nLook I'm sending MC's on a stretcher\nThese bitches uh, all because my lyrical conversation\nGot these bitches begging for penetration\nHumiliation, Rappers they will know I demolish ya\nSpit you to a coma Dot finish 'em\n\nUh, wait, Diminish ya preach like a ministerCompetition naw they pussy get the \nGet in the ass like animals imitators get plenty of\nPropane, hotter when winter come, some insane\nDope mane, bee's the studio, You ain't lived here\nEver since I done came, record me yoooo\nYour own momma wouldn't do that\nShe rather throw herself in the dumpster than listen to trash"}}, {"title": "Dope Dealer", "album": "Blank Face LP", "year": "2016-07-08", "lyrics":

dare you to stare\nNever felt fair, no room for a tear\nCome on dump, don't give a fuck if the coast clear\nJacket cover the ratchet, pants hang to my calf\nBurner over the ab, sendin' shots under your jab\nYou really wanna diss me?\nBelieve it like Ripley when I'm off the fifth of whiskey\nDamaging my kidney, I wish a nigga tempt me\nThen it's all bad, leave his parents all sad\nCops with a mystery, murderin' ain't shit to me\nThis a killing symphony, my nigga, for real\nI still keep the weapon concealed, body will spill\nHollow tips stuck in your grill, give a fuck how you feel\nTired of resisting this murder addiction\nFuck a conviction, bust shots, slaughter conviction\nLucifer soul, my temperature cold\nEyes blood shot, throwin up blood clots, body in shock\nI need me a doc, but I figure I'm too sick\nFuck it, adrenaline pumping may lead in to something\nAssumption on life is still, livin' a trife\nAsthmatic causing havoc, keep spazzin' til my brain get damaged\nStill remain most scandalous, that bang hammers\nFuck surveillance, shit, murk in front of cameras\nDump 'em in the sand like tan or big blands\nMore grammar shit, I'm the illest motherfucker\nVerse 2: \nSplash blocks like Dikembe when I sensai, who wanna shoot?\nThe liquor hear me, I'm off the Remy like Papoose\nI got the truths of a thousand bishops\nTroops of a thousand niggas, you can get your ass missing\nLike a white bitch with big tits to be specific\nI'm over they heads when the words get pledged\nFright night, gun tucked tight like a newborn\nDance with the Devil, hopefully you get your groove on\nWhen I blaze this medal\nLike a rolling stone, flesh and bones come out\nLike a thug reunion, watch yall dumb out\nMost likely, half of you fraudulent niggas don't like me\nScared to fight me even if you had hands just like me\nK Dot, bare arms like a haltertop\nLive from the barbershop, who want a fade?\nWho want war? I got a drawer full of hand grenades\nTake it back to them Contra days, so fall back\nIt's real, off cognac, and pills, we twist caps then peel\nBananas with the hammers, play if you will\nA bullet proof for a shield, that won't work\nI got big big very big big bullets, and they hurt\nLift up your skirt if you play pussy, don't push me, I'm light\nYou pushing up daisies, if the pump do a push up tonight\nI put, I put a new price on your head, like a mannequin dressed well\nStudents from Harvard can hear the nigga Yale\nI'm cold hearted, oh well\nI get's retarded, the yellow bus I'm a park it\nIn front of your house, hop out, gun in ya mouth (Blakka!)\nDuck shows in your peek hole, me and my Hoover crip\nBut all I bang is your bitch, don't get me twist\nLet's do this, I'm ludicrous, disturbing the peace\nPacing back and forth like a stewardess, it's plain to see\nDa Evils\n\n\"If you gotta go out, that's how you go out!\nThat motherfucker took his destiny in his own hands!\""}}, {"title": "Ezell [40 Glocc Killa]", "album": "Gangsta & Soul", "year": "2009-05-14", "lyrics": "Ezell\nShut your mouth\nBum ass nigga still talking\nKeep your mouth shut Ezell\nI hear you now\nPussy ass nigga\n\nWord on the street that this nigga still talking\nWhole year later and this nigga start barking\nHowling at the moon, guess he waiting for the get back\nKnows that when I see him, guaranteed I push your shit back\nSay you want beef?\nWell I'm a give your ass beef\nWhen I see you in the streets, nigga bon appetit\nI don't eat?\nYou know where I be 51st Street\nRight on Figg with the little homie\nHoover Spank 3\nWith my nigga Flossy and my nigga Ricky\nI ain't stopping with this rapping till my niggas scrap free\nThey gave him 42 for shootin niggas out in broad day\nReally with this crippin think I care bout what this fraud say\nOut burnin dina with my nigga El Camino\nJust look to see your lil homie flexin\nHit the freeway cuz your hood a 100 miles away\nExit 51st nigga welcome to the turf\n\nTone it down my nigga\nCuz I'll be ridin through ya town my nigga\nI be around my nigga\nHoover St yeah you know my stompin grounds my nigga\nYoutubin' ass nigga\nFalse-banging pussy old faggot ass nigga\nSpray ya block with ya own name\nNigga I am no game\nThis nigga must think I'm playin'\n\nSee I ain't wanna have to call this nigga out\nMale version Supahead every rapper in his mouth\nYou never gettin bread shoulda chose the next route\nCuz I'm pickin niggas off best believe you receive\nEvery thing I'm sayin at you like an email\nLook into my eyes you can see hell\nWent to jail made bail never gave a detail\nInform ass nigga, you the new rapper Ezell\nMe I be a Figel, Castro, groovy lookin ?\nYou can ask Ace I'm in the hood gettin cash flow\nPotato on the mag, niggas gettin mashed yo\nMessin over all y'all, fuck y'all all broad\nPussy ass nigga, g-strings on with large bras\nNeed to check yo lil homie cuz his ass paused\nIf I whup ya ass it'd probably be a hate crime\nThis the last diss, already killed ya ass the first time\n\n\nLook first and foremost nigga you's a bitch nigga\nHidin out in the IE nigga, holla at me when you LA nigga\nNigga holdin guns to the camera like the camera goin shoot back\nNiggas don't put guns Youtube nigga what the fucks yo problem nigga yousa faggot nigga\nYou and that naked ass nigga oiled up talkin bout real niggas knuckle up\nNigga you ain't even scrapped enough bitch\nYou know where I be at 51st and Fig you need that nigga, get at me one time nigga\nTop Dawg ENT getting every dollar I see I'm the head nigga of that GED shit nigga\nYou want Tyga nigga you gotta come to me nigga that's my little brother nigga talkin you wanna fight Wayne nigga\nNigga Wayne all the way in New Orleans nigga the fuck you wanna do with Wayne nigga leave Wayne alone nigga come down to LA with all that bullshit nigga\nYou ain't killed nothing you ain't did nothing nigga\nWhat's yo rap sheet nigga?

ring show chips (?) pringles, Working on the single\nYeah it's comin soon niggas better be Platoon\nDroppin bombs in this bitch niggas better clear the room\nMurder murder out soon\nKill kill is what I will\nGotta keep it hella ill to make you motherfuckers snill\nStill giving hoes the chills\nCause I'm cooler than the AC with the wind blowing\nSee Cali you been snowing\nNifty 50 kizu\nMade it out

but\nYou know you in a league that you got no business in\nThe way I put together sentences should have been a sin\nGenocide most the lambs murdered by Christians then\nMany gems drippin over the airwaves\nSo get a pen\nWrite it down\nAs I convey to you why I am him\nThe sovereign lord of recording\nNiggas want the future now so your verse they fast forwarding it\nOk I'm feelin myself, you see the confidence\nI took it a level higher\nIt's more like common sense\nAnd since I ain't got nothing in common with dudes outside of rhyming\nI'mma sit and study timin, in alpaca slippers\nFly dapper niggas\nSpilling my drink while I'm laughing at these action figures\n\n\nQ nigga\nBrain damage from this young menace\nMentis, you can play the apprentice\nBut"}}, {"title": "Figg get da Money",

love\nFuck all that rapping, let me talk to you\nBook you a ticket, so we can kick it\nMake an escape somewhere we'll be safe\nClose your purse, I got my Visa on me\nPick out whatever, it ain't shit but money, turn you to my honey\nTake off my Salvatore, wipe your nose for ya\nClimb a mountain in the snow for ya\nYou see these dummies always cut you lose\nBut so much that a G can do, hit the weed, have a drink or two\nI pay attention, I can listen too, you say he fucking who?\nFresh out the shower, let me smell your hair\nGarnier Fructis got my knees weak, let's cuddle in these sheets\nLet me hold you for a moment, it feels right, don't it?\nFrom a lost child to a woman\nEye contact and soft kisses, strong grip, she want a gangsta, on crip\n\n(Strolling in the party)\nCause you never met or seen a nigga quite like me\nJust tryna give it to ya\n(Walking in the dark)\nA groovy nigga that's way too G\n(Tryna tell you baby!)\n\nA 5'3\" stallion\nDaddy was from Harlem, her momma was Italian\nI don't see the challenge\nOf having two girls, you just gotta keep the balance\nI told her light that candle\nI heard you do yoga, I'm tryna see examples\nYour ass is like a handle\nSee us on the front page, that'll be a scandal\nTake off this red shirt, then my flannel\nI need some head first, then I'mma fuck you in them sandals\nHit the coochie like a dime sack\nAin't those Gucci, didn't I buy that?\nClose your eyes, go and try that\nYou only live once and I know I got you soaking wet\nThirsty, is the liquor store open yet\nI need some Moet to pour it on yo ass like a paint\nBack shots leave the pussy shaking, this my open invitation\nIn the morning, make my toast with fresh orange juice and turkey bacon, bitch\nDom Kennedy\n\n(Strolling in the party)\nCause

duct\nUpper crust, toast bread\nTalk of the town, thinking you know everything 'bout\nA nigga cause them bitches talk loud in them beauty shop\nGossip before your man came get ya\nYouTube clips can't

cuz\nYea I'm Q, but you can call me Quincy\nIf you want or whatever baby, it's all love\nFuck all that rapping, let me talk to you\nBook you a ticket, so we can kick it\nMake an escape somewhere we'll be safe\nClose your purse, I got my Visa on me\nPick out whatever, it ain't shit but money, turn you to my honey\nTake off my Salvatore, wipe your nose for ya\nClimb a mountain in the snow for ya\nYou see these dummies always cut you lose\nBut so much that a G can do, hit the weed, have a drink or two\nI pay attention, I can listen too, you say he fucking who?\nFresh out the shower, let me smell your hair\nGarnier Fructis got my knees weak, let's cuddle in these sheets\nLet me hold you for a moment, it feels right, don't it?\nFrom a lost child to a woman\nEye contact and soft kisses, strong grip, she want a gangsta, on crip\n\n(Strolling in the party)\nCause you never met or seen a nigga quite like me\nJust tryna give it to ya\n(Walking in the dark)\nA groovy nigga that's way too G\n(Tryna tell you baby!)\n\nA 5'3\" stallion\nDaddy was from Harlem, her momma was Italian\nI don't see the challenge\nOf having two girls, you just gotta keep the balance\nI told her light that candle\nI heard you do yoga, I'm tryna see examples\nYour ass is like a handle\nSee us on the front page, that'll be a scandal\nTake off this red shirt, then my flannel\nI need some head first, then I'mma fuck you in them sandals\nHit the coochie like a dime sack\nAin't those Gucci, didn't I buy that?\nClose your eyes, go and try that\nYou only live once and I know I got you soaking wet\nThirsty, is the liquor store open yet\nI need some Moet to pour it on yo ass like a paint\nBack shots leave the pussy shaking, this my open invitation\nIn the morning, make my toast with fresh orange juice and turkey bacon, bitch\nDom Kennedy\n\n(Strolling in the party)\nCause you never met or seen a nigga quite like me\nJust tryna give it to ya\n(Walking in the dark)\nA groovy nigga that's way too G\n(Tryna tell you baby!)\n\nUnderground Royal\nFlow over they heads, air duct\nUpper crust, toast bread\nTalk of the town, thinking you know everything 'bout\nA nigga cause them bitches talk loud in them beauty shop\nGossip before your man came get ya\nYouTube clips can't show it all\nCome and get down if you really wan' get up, baby doll\nAin't nobody 'round to judge, go on\nGet if off your chest, vent, come up out that dress, bitch\nShe ain't take offense\nProceeded to take hits of the pregame twist, smoke out, smash\nGrub a little bit, pass out, post-game events\nToo high to find the remote, fell asleep to a infomercial\nWoke up in her mouth, reruns of Full House, followed by some Urkel\nOG my strain, rarely do I blaze purple\nSome of them growers be in a rush fucking the game up\nYou gon' learn about all that stuff long as you hang around us\nGo on roll up\n\n(Strolling in the party)\nCause you never met or seen a nigga quite like me\nJust tryna give it to ya\n(Walking in

(Will you sell that pussy for me?)\nWill you sell that pussy for me?\nWill you sell that pussy for me? (Will you sell that pussy for me?)\n\nCheck the forecast, it's Wavy Q, I should make the news\nMy fortune said that I'll be pimping you and your pussy juice\nSuper sweet, sell a trick a treat, hope your lips in shape\nCause you worked your feet as you stroll them streets, beeper checking\nHope no cops arresting, girl, I told you them narcs be pressing\nBetter act like you a pedestrian and don't mention my name\nMy pimping is game, cold limp with my cane, got gold on my chain\nCome pinky my ring, it's so blickety bling\nOn 51st and Figg, grew up about ten minutes from the real Ricky\nWhere the shoelaces is orange with H hats like we from Houston\nCondoms in hoes' purses with baby wipes for they coochie\nYou's a ho that's selling booty, no need to be acting bougie\nBitch, I give your ass a noogie and a chicken nugget\nAnd make you watch me at the movies, I'm panoramic\nMy filming be rated pimping, my mink dragging\nWith two bitches that go and get it, my hoes get it\n\nWill you sell that pussy for me?\nWill you sell that pussy for me? (Will you sell that pussy for me?)\nWill you sell that pussy for me?\nWill you sell that pussy for me?

Accept the fact that the bitch belongs to the world\nP, cause that ho only yours as long as she hoeing\nBut Happy Pimping and Merry Ho Ho\nKeep an eye on bottom bitch too\nCause that bitch'll run a ho or two off, mane\nPimps only fuck with pimps, homie, that's why we so solid\nRed to blue, to debt, to due, it's easier\nTo put a watermelon through the eye of a needle\nThis is done by choice, not by force\nI ain't asking, I'm telling you\n\nWill you sell that pussy for me?\nWill you sell that pussy for me?

stepped in the club with a ounce\nGettin' high 'til the sunrise, thugs in the house\nStacks to the ceilin', nigga, not a bit of fillin'\nYoung nigga with a attitude, but not a better villain\nGet a million, I'm illin', couple Swishers and I'm chillin'\nMake a bitch feel good, pussy hole, fill it\nBelieve it, Top Dawg, so they want to breathe it\nBad bitch pussy-eater, so they want to (-) it\nIf she wearin' Prada, then I got to take her outta\nAnd if she wearin' Louis, then I'm grippin' on her booty\nBring it to me, bring the camera out and, baby, film a movie\nPussy gooey, rock the microphone, so now the hoes pursue me\nGettin' every dollar just to make the hoes holler\nTop Dawg scholar, known rock and roller\nGreedy than a bitch, so a bitch gettin' nada\nJust dick, hold this, tell a bitch, 'Quick, swallow'\n\nI done traveled the word nowadays\nAnd all these groupie hoes on my dick, on my dick\nJust chillin', lollygaggin' around and these hoes still know my shit\nCause I'm that shit\nGangsta rapper, but a different note\nThug rapper with spectacular flow, what it sound like?\nEvery dollar, yeah, I'm reppin' it though\nTop Dawg still rockin' the show, so it sounds like this\n\nA young nigga with the hot shit\nLick a bitch down real quick cause the flow sick\nA ghetto nigga with the right sticks\nPriceless, still the shit, nigga, that's a cold stint\nVIP where I be, lookin' real big\nEyes real low, off a little X\nNeed a little sex, nutted on the breast\nMove to the next, relieve more stress\nFuckin' bitches good, said they got a Q fetish\nSmooth way I talk had my fuckin', all the feelings\nHave a friend jealous, young nigga so rebellious\nPussy cover up the hair like umbrellas\nG.E.D., Top Dawg, young nigga's flawless\nFuckin' different girls, different states, all Georgias\nHoes all marvelous, tour bus lights'll get the hoes feelin' hyper\nPussy target, dick a sniper\n\n\nWhat you know about a gangsta?\nYeah, they swimmin', love this thug shit\nThey keep callin' me and beggin' for this thug dick\nTreat you like I seen you in Jay Rock video\n(-) video and Nipsey video, so I hit it like (-)\nLet's go to the room, so I can dig in your (-)\nPrince of the city, yeah, he is me\nAnd I'm gettin' every dollar like G.E.D\nI fuck with Top Dawg, but I ain't talkin' 'bout Snoop\nThe only Crip nigga looks fly in a suit\nFresh white tee, blue belt, new Gucci\nShe say she love gangstas, bang that movie\nShe told me, 'K-Boy, baby, you so cute'\nCause I know Tyga and Schoolboy Q\nBut I don't really trip cause I know that I'm the shit\nSo I give 'em thirty minutes of this East Side dick"}}, {"title": "Habits & Contradictions [Credits]", "album": "Habits & Contradictions", "year": "2012-01-14", "lyrics": "1.

morning a fantasy back, when the only fan I had, was a fiend\n(Huhhuhhuh-huhhuh!)\nMeet me by the Acura, cause the cops like\nTo get help from the store camera, they always in my cornea\nBut it's cool, I've been catching on to they formula\nSee I'm a real loc, my street sign I'll kill fo'\nThen rewind my Indo, then unroll my rillo\nThe bad guy, never once been a ho's hero\nHe get zero, I said nada, bitch pass the 'cama (Uh, yeah)\nHow'd it feel to be a real nigga? (I'm a product of a real nigga)\nLa-la familia (Get confronted by a real nigga)\nFuck with one of my real niggas\n(Sunlight, night fall, summertime gotta ball)\nHow'd it feel to be a real nigga?\n(Sunlight, night fall, summertime gotta ball)\nHow'd it feel to be a real nigga (My whole life I've been a real nigga)\nLa-la familia (Get confronted by a real nigga)\nFuck with one of my real niggas\n(It's on like night fall, summertime gotta ball)\nHow'd it feel to be a real nigga?\n\n\nI done jumped up off my ass\nHit the lick and barely passed but I quickly got to balling\n2012 ain't really happen\nSo I guess it's back to trapping, eyes open night to morning\nHad roaches in my cereal\nMy uncle stole my stereo, my grandma can't control him\n\nBut... Every last one of us had a pistol in the room, nigga\nBut... Click-clack, pow-pow-pow (Boom, nigga)\nBut... Me Glock clock familia (Boom)\n\nFind a nigga realer than me, my socks stink\nEat so much pussy that my mustache pink\nStrapping, my pants seam, no need for a belt, gangsta lean help\nHoodie on backwards, with the eyes cut out\nMy hate felt my .45 elder, poetry's deep\nI never fail ya, ScHoolboy bust flame: orange-yellow\nHigher than Margielas, since a young nigga\nI admired the crack sellers, seen my uncle steal\nFrom his mother, now that's the money that I'm talking 'bout\nThink about it, the smoker ain't got shit and everyday\nHe still get a hit, whether jacking radios or sucking dick\nSell his kids and chop his wrists and sealing his lips\nCause he don't want the feds arresting his fix, didn't take much\nTo get me convinced, coincidence that I ain't fucking with work\nUnless we rewind, and answer my church\nTimes getting harder, than my dick on a growth spurt\nAround the same time, all you niggas was on purp, my sober ass Was snatching her purse, make the ice cream truck  -\nFreeze! Give me the keys, extra Fritos, chili and -\nCheese! Threw some Baby Lucas in his eyes, before I -\nLeave! The cops'll never get the lead, grandma taught me well\nAnd my uncle gun, was the accessory, 211 sipping, plus a robbery\nThis little piggy went to market, this little piggy carry chrome\n\nI done jumped up off my ass\nHit the lick and barely passed but I quickly got to balling\n2012 ain't really happen\nSo I guess it's back to trapping, eyes open night to morning\nHad roaches in my cereal\nMy uncle stole my stereo, my grandma can't control him\n\nBut... Every last one of us had a pistol in the room, nigga\nBut... Click-clack, pow-pow-pow (Boom, nigga)\nBut... Meet Glock clock familia (Boom)\n\nGrandma said she loved me, I told her I loved her more\nShe always got me things, that we couldn't afford\nThe new Js and Tommy Hill in my drawers\nSega Genesis, Nintendo 64, see Golden Eye was away at war\nWe wasn't thinking of getting money then\nNor did I wonder why, my uncle done sold his Benz\nCause he been tripping now, he sweats a lot and slimming down\nI also notice moms be locking doors, when he around\nBut anyways, his wife done left him and now he living with us\nMy bike is missing, Grandma like to hide her check every month\nMy uncle's nuts, he used to give me whiskey to piss in cups\nKnocking on the door telling me to \"Hurry up!\", he in a rush\nI gave it to him, then got my ass whipped for doing it\nMoms used to tell me like, \"Nigga, know who you dealing with.\"\nThem was the good days ,'til I was raised the older ways\nRat-Tone, my nigga's brother showed me my first K\nI was amazed, me and Floyd was in the back, he called us over like - HEY!YAWK, YAWK, YAWK, YAWK! We like -\"Daaaaaamn, nigga\"\nThen again - YAWK, YAWK! We like, \"Daaaaaamn, nigga!\"\nHearing him say \"Cuz'\", turned us to a faaaaaan, nigga!\nLater on he got locked, so now we're taking his fades\nContinue the chapter from his life, we flipping that page\nGangbanging was a ritual and Grandma would help\nShe should've never left her gun on the shelf\nThis little piggy went to market, this little piggy carry chrome\n\nI done jumped up off my ass\nHit the lick and barely passed but I quickly got to balling\n2012 ain't really happen\nSo I guess it's back to trapping, eyes open night to morning\nHad roaches in my cereal\nMy uncle stole my stereo, my grandma can't control him\n\nBut...

Shit, I was into sneakers\nAnd fitted caps, side kicks\nMy same bitch, she a down bitch\nHad a little daughter, glad it ain't a boy\nKnew she'd bring me joy, so I named her Joy\nKiss her on her head, then I kiss her lips\nThen I kiss her cheek, lay her down to sleep\nTrials and tribulations helped me through my situations\nLittle observations stopped the cops from confrontations\nAnd the ghetto bird, and a nigga snitched\nBut I'm still dipping, shit, I ain't tripping\n\nI'm good, I'm good, I'm good, I'm good, I'm good...\nI'm good, I'm good, I'm good, I'm good, I'm good...\nI'm good, I'm

even got to see the Knicks\nI've been to Dallas, slap a five with the bench\nBack to the hood where niggas betting on the six\nBut shit is crazy\nLil' Teisha and Tamika bout to kill they babies\nPregnant at the same time, and they think that shit is cute\nAlways running from the truth, bigger dream they must pursue\nAnd they babies wasn't in it\nJust going bout they business in the club\nShe off of Guinness, adioses with the lemon\nV.I.P. she dreams of, in the club looking for mean buzz\nIn a dress looking distinctive\nAss hanging, got that ass hanging with the biggest baller in the club\nAin't got a dub, but she want some love\nWasn't polite, but she feel it's right (feel it's right)\nLay it down, then he dimmed the lights, played it right for the night\n\nI'm good, I'm

change\nEither way around, the cycle still remains\nOut my project window, observing the wannabes blowing endo\nShooting dice on the corner, big homie roll up with his kinfolk\nUnfold a stack on 'em like, what they hitting for?\nSlamming the doors on his Benzo\nHe left the engine running, bumping something sounding like\nLate eighties R&B, trunk full of China white\nType of nigga ladies like, known dope dealer\nMoney, cash, hoes getter, slash stone cold killer\nHe can't sleep at night, his victim's eyes piercing through his soul\nHe wake up every time his eyes close\nThat's who them young boys aspire to see\nUnderneath the palm trees, that's who they dying to be\nBut I'm good\n\nI'm good, I'm good, I'm good, I'm good, I'm good...\nI'm good, I'm good, I'm good, I'm good, I'm

got some nerve, fuck a war, we trying to serve\nMotherfucking 8 balls, til\u2019 we live at the pool hall\nAnd knock billiards out of your business, ya bitch\nThats my surroundings in Compton, have common sense\nSmell death in the air, around here, thats a common scent\nYou know the gunpowder\nYou know when your homie barely blink, he just done powder\nOnly at seventeen\nYou know the common statistic inspired by hoop dreams\nNow hire about street schemes, and getting blood money\nI try my best to stay focused and hope the city love me\nPray it's not lust, cause if it is, I\u2019d be death in a month\nLord forbid, for the good kid\nThey took his life\nShe want her baby back, like a cooked rib\nBut that\u2019s just life, where I\u2019m from\n\nIf there\u2019s a shining star\nHope my city is not too far\nSo we can live again\nSee, where I come from is hard\nHope all over, we can start\nSo we can live again, so we can live again\n\nI\u2019ve seen this young\u2019un on the train, I had to pick his brain\nHe said he on his way uptown to get a brick of caine\u2019\nHe said he needed a come up, because selling nicks' was lame\nHe needed a change, so I gave him fifty cent\nHe looked up at me like I was crazy, I said listen man\nI rather give you my last to see you live again\nJust cause you change what you pitching, don\u2019t make the difference\nYou gotta get off the mound, and put the game down\nPetty thoughts could keep your brain down\nI leave you with that jewel, go get the chain now\nAnd put it together\nYou see coming up, we ain\u2019t have that shit to keep our mind focused\nI love Mike, but it was a hassle trying to buy Jordans\nMy nigga hustle all day in front of the corner store\nTo get a pair, niggas killed him right in front the mall\nSo all the hustling for nothing man\nI threw my pair on the lightpole because of him\nLike fuck it man\n\n\nTrying to move foward, though it never stops\nA mother\u2019s son dead, was killed by some kids popped\nShots, they back and forth\nMurder for murder, the beef recycled is light\nNo idols, bunch of unread bibles\nAllies that turned to rivals, niggas turned street disciples\nSmokers get high as Eiffiels\nAddicted to being fiends\nBecause of the feds as we pledge to let our plague spread\nTiny this and if and that if they banging back\nBecause they\nAdapt to being black, strapped and gang tats, look\nRats get mouse trapped\nCan\u2019t afford tuition\nBut hit a lick I bet I earn crack, I heard that\nLooking at the sky, hoping a light would shine\nDaylight saving times all the time on this block of mines\nAll the time with this Glock of mines\nSwear to God man it ain\u2019t a rhyme, I grind for a piece of mine\nCo-sign\n\n\nWhen you look at my brothers, what's your first impression?\nDoes the sight of us leave you guessing?\nOr do you understand the stressing, the aggression\nThe look of no hope on my niggas' faces\nLike the Lord overlooked us when He handed down His graces\nSee embraces, fall short on the numb tips of street entrepeneur fingers\nStuck in the walls of the project halls where the Coke smell still lingers -\nExternal blingers is all we can be\nCause on the inside we been given nothin to shine on\nAnd the gig is harder to get than Coke so niggas get their grind on\nBecause the TV tells us aim high Nigga, make all goals lateral\nBut that takes paper that we don't have so niggas put their souls up as collateral\nNow, some niggas reclaim 'em, some blame 'em\nMaking excuses to sell 'em\nBut when a nigga goes from not doin', to doin'\nWhat can you tell him?\nNot to be a nigga?\nShit I gots to be a nigga that's how I pay the bills and I'mma do that whether I gotta sling this coke or exploit these rhyme skills", "image":

shoot shit, that stab shit\nRock a flag and don\u2019t give a fuck about U.S flag shit\nGeorge Bush got some nerve, fuck a war, we trying to serve\nMotherfucking 8 balls, til\u2019 we live at the pool hall\nAnd knock billiards out of your business, ya bitch\nThats my surroundings in Compton, have common sense\nSmell death in the air, around here, thats a common scent\nYou know the gunpowder\nYou know when your homie barely blink, he just done powder\nOnly at seventeen\nYou know the common statistic inspired by hoop dreams\nNow hire about street schemes, and getting blood money\nI try my best to stay focused and hope the city love me\nPray it's not lust, cause if it is, I\u2019d be death in a month\nLord forbid, for the good kid\nThey took his life\nShe want her baby back, like a cooked rib\nBut that\u2019s just life, where I\u2019m from\n\nIf there\u2019s a shining star\nHope my city is not too far\nSo we can live again\nSee, where I come from is hard\nHope all over, we can start\nSo we can live again, so we can live again\n\nI\u2019ve seen this young\u2019un on the train, I had to pick his brain\nHe said he on his way uptown to get a brick of caine\u2019\nHe said he needed a come up, because selling nicks' was lame\nHe needed a change, so I gave him fifty cent\nHe looked up at me like I was crazy, I said listen man\nI rather give you my last to see you live again\nJust cause you change what you pitching, don\u2019t make the difference\nYou gotta get off the mound, and put the game down\nPetty thoughts could keep your brain down\nI leave you with that jewel, go get the chain now\nAnd put it together\nYou see coming up, we ain\u2019t have that shit to keep our mind focused\nI love Mike, but it was a hassle trying to buy Jordans\nMy nigga hustle all day in front of the corner store\nTo get a pair, niggas killed him right in front the mall\nSo all the hustling for nothing man\nI threw my pair on the lightpole because of him\nLike fuck it man\n\n\nTrying to move foward, though it never stops\nA mother\u2019s son dead, was killed by some kids popped\nShots, they back and forth\nMurder for murder, the beef recycled is light\nNo idols, bunch of unread bibles\nAllies that turned to rivals, niggas turned street disciples\nSmokers get high as Eiffiels\nAddicted to being fiends\nBecause of the feds as we pledge to let our plague spread\nTiny this and if and that if they banging back\nBecause they\nAdapt to being black, strapped and gang tats, look\nRats get mouse trapped\nCan\u2019t afford tuition\nBut hit a lick I bet I earn crack, I heard that\nLooking at the sky, hoping a light would shine\nDaylight saving times all the time on this block of mines\nAll the time with this Glock of mines\nSwear to God man it ain\u2019t a rhyme, I grind for a piece of mine\nCo-sign\n\n\nWhen you look at my brothers, what's your first impression?\nDoes the sight of us leave you guessing?\nOr do you understand the stressing, the aggression\nThe look of no hope on my niggas' faces\nLike the Lord overlooked us when He handed down His graces\nSee embraces, fall short on the numb tips of street entrepeneur fingers\nStuck in the walls of the project halls where the Coke smell still lingers -\nExternal blingers is all we can be\nCause on the inside we been given nothin to shine on\nAnd the gig is harder to get than Coke so niggas get their grind on\nBecause the TV tells us aim high Nigga, make all goals lateral\nBut that takes paper that we don't have so niggas put their souls up as collateral\nNow, some niggas reclaim 'em, some blame 'em\nMaking excuses to sell 'em\nBut when a nigga goes from not doin', to doin'\nWhat can you tell him?\nNot to be a nigga?\nShit I gots to be a nigga that's how I pay the bills and I'mma do that whether I gotta sling this coke or exploit these rhyme skills"}}, {"title": "Live Life", "album": "Gangsta & Soul", "year": "2009-05-14", "lyrics": "As I enter my lifestyle\nNigga

my gift just to better my surprise\nTatted up my face just to better my disguise\nAnd I\u2019m still ghetto in the hood, chilly with the fries\nPut that on the fifties, oh this rap shit is simply\nEasier, fingertips greasier name in the media, encyclopidea\nAnd this rap im spittin\u2019 I get it in sentences\nIm lyrically sentenced behind bars\n\nBeat dope, flow tight guess a nigga go with the fast life\nSounds like, like Hip-Hop, Hip-Hop, work for something to something\nTo Hip-Hop, Hip-Hop yeah made a little dough from the fast life\nNow im on the mic trying to spread lights it

bitch, niggas know the world is mine\nSo your life in my fist, life real, grinding hard just to pay the light bills\nSpitting with aggression just imagine how my mic feels\nUnderstandable why these niggas call me Hannibal Lecter\nBlacked up fuck around, dissect you, top dogs protect you\nNobody is better, I give a lecture to the rest of the semester\nNo sleep, eyes wide open, just to let my brain speak\nG-E-D Top Dog E-N-T\n\n\nHuh so hip-hop got me rapped in\nPunch opened up the back door, and then I crept in\nLet\u2019s in all this so nonsense rapping\nKnowing that I\u2019m living every single track I\u2019m giving in\nPaying Gucci for tuition, learn to play your position\nMurdered the competition, taking you on a mission\nA journey to big dreams, my life in a sixteen\nWe trying to trap cream, I\u2019m done with these dope fiends\nSeen\n\nI don't know what it is, I don\u2019t know, K.

life\u2019s a bitch so I don\u2019t smile\nStill puffin\u2019 herb just to lower my eyebrows\nEye lashes, eyes close, ears open, gun smokin\u2019, worst pokin\u2019, rap\u2019s quoting\nClose your eyes to the vibe, see the pigs floating\nNot a dog, kid I\u2019m the shit, see the rhyme potent\nHmm\u2026 Never wanted to hit you with the lies\nWorking on my gift just to better my surprise\nTatted up my face just to better my disguise\nAnd I\u2019m still ghetto in the hood, chilly with the fries\nPut that on the fifties, oh this rap shit is simply\nEasier, fingertips greasier name in the media, encyclopidea\nAnd this rap im spittin\u2019 I get it in sentences\nIm lyrically sentenced behind bars\n\nBeat dope, flow tight guess a nigga go with the fast life\nSounds like, like Hip-Hop, Hip-Hop, work for something to something\nTo Hip-Hop, Hip-Hop yeah made a little dough from the fast life\nNow im on the mic trying to spread lights it sounds like, like\nHip-Hop, Hip-Hop, made something from nothing with\nHip-Hop, Hip-Hop\n\nThese white folks they ain't care how I grew up, gang signs threw up\nLifestyle blew up , travel different hoods, every other curb knew us\nManaged by the Bloods, though I still bang Hoover, spittin that manure\nWatch how I maneuver, buzz down in Cuba, flow like a lunatic\nSee the wrist iced out in this bitch, niggas know the world is mine\nSo your life in my fist, life real, grinding hard just to pay the light bills\nSpitting with aggression just imagine how my mic feels\nUnderstandable why these niggas call me Hannibal Lecter\nBlacked up fuck around, dissect you, top dogs protect you\nNobody is better, I give a lecture to the rest of the semester\nNo sleep, eyes wide open, just to let my brain speak\nG-E-D Top Dog E-N-T\n\n\nHuh so hip-hop got me rapped in\nPunch opened up the back door, and then I crept in\nLet\u2019s in all this so nonsense rapping\nKnowing that I\u2019m living every single track I\u2019m giving in\nPaying Gucci for tuition, learn to play your position\nMurdered the competition, taking you on a mission\nA journey to big dreams, my life in a sixteen\nWe trying to trap cream, I\u2019m done with these dope fiends\nSeen\n\nI don't know what it is, I don\u2019t know, K. Dot uglier than a bitch, Punch what he do, got a bald head (laughing)"}}, {"title": "Lord Have Mercy", "album": "Blank Face LP", "year": "2016-07-08", "lyrics": "Preacher told me don't set trip on a Sunday\nKnowin' damn well that devil gettin' played Monday\n\nLord have mercy\nPlease Heaven's mercy\nLord have mercy\nPlease Heaven's mercy\n\nNa-na-na na-na na-na\nNever, ever\nEver, ever get caught tellin' on my niggas\nI'm a gangbanger, deadbeat father and drug dealer\nWhen the money and fame gone, tell me who stayin' with you\nRunnin' from God's creations\nShakin' these broken hands and meetin' with blank faces\nSnake eyes keepin' my back achin'\nDirty habits of rappin' and bein' savage\nStill hangin' with niggas that can't do nothin' but cause damage\nGuess I'm bein' a real nigga like I'm 'posed to be\nBut bein' real never once bought the groceries and\nTop told me, \"Keep rappin', you'll make it hopefully\"\nAnd hope was all that I needed, dreamin' myself to work\nCus workin' to fail was better than bullet holes in my shirt\nThe demons hate when you make it and stay alive\nThey'd rather see me down under than see me fly\nLord have mercy!\n\nLord have mercy\nPlease, Heaven's mercy\nLord have mercy\nPlease, Heaven's mercy\n\nThey say I was a wanted man, a wanted man\nRunnin' with my gun in hand, gun in hand\nThey don't wanna see the wanted man, the wanted man\nComin' through with the gun in hand, the gun in hand, damn\nLord have mercy", "image": "https://images.genius.com/4387645fa58bf58f64c2e4f8733125be.1000x1000x1.jpg", "artist": "ScHoolboy Q", "raw": {"annotation_count": 11, "api_path": "/songs/2670496", "description": {"dom": {"tag": "root", "children": [{"tag": "p", "children": ["Living a lifestyle of sin, Q worries if his sins will be forgiven."]}, "", {"tag": "p", "children": ["Swizz produced this Q track.

you\nRunnin' from God's creations\nShakin' these broken hands and meetin' with blank faces\nSnake eyes keepin' my back achin'\nDirty habits of rappin' and bein' savage\nStill hangin' with niggas that can't do nothin' but cause damage\nGuess I'm bein' a real nigga like I'm 'posed to be\nBut bein' real never once bought the groceries and\nTop told me, \"Keep rappin', you'll make it hopefully\"\nAnd hope was all that I needed, dreamin' myself to work\nCus workin' to fail was better than bullet holes in my shirt\nThe demons hate when you make it and stay alive\nThey'd rather see me down under than see me fly\nLord have mercy!\n\nLord have mercy\nPlease, Heaven's mercy\nLord have mercy\nPlease, Heaven's mercy\n\nThey say I was a wanted man, a wanted man\nRunnin' with my gun in hand, gun in

fathers and no bitches so fuck it\nShoemaking '96, make the best of it\nLicking on the thumbs, wipe my shoe, because I just scuffed it\nJust another day, another gat buzzin'\nLying up in first grade, like we all fucking\nYou want to fight? We all fight! See, we all rushing\nStreetlights is home, when I'm home mom is fuzzin\nWaking up for the proper time to sneak, jump out at the window\nNow we back up in the streets\nWho got the weed?\nWho got the liqour?\nWho got the flow?\nWho about to rip ya?\nSpit my lyrical shit, now we back up on the bitch\nSaid we're dreaming that we're stars, while we point at different cars\nWishing that we rich, but sooner or later reality hits\nSooner or later our memory switch\nDifferent gats and different clips\nSteady relaxing on the strips\nThinking life is just a bitch\n\nPost traumatic, cocaine repulsive habits\nRavish the black masses on the Reagan era\nThe reign of terror the masses, the birth of a nation\nFree basing, babies craving a vaccination in this world\nAnd it's desires slowly passing through the fire\nWhen I wish to do right, what is wrong got expired\nKnow i'm preachin' to the choir lost in this quagmire\nSitting on fools gold, 24\" inch, I ball wise\nAnd honestly, the truth will set you free\nAnd yall all liars\nI'm giving them food for thought, since they say they ain't eating\nComplaining about hunger pains, in reality they teething\nThey ain't ready for the other side, they're overworking\nTransmission, slow down to check the mileage\nThe road to riches stay crowded, fake smiling\nViolence in the mist of it all, remain consciousness\n\nYo, sitting up, locked in my room, writing my thoughts\nTrying to get it across, but half of my niggas is lost\nIt's like, niggas rather claim a set, than earn a check so fuck it\nHit the burner aim it high up at your neck and bust it\nWhoa it's that easy, that's how you rock it\nDamn, that's how you chop it\nCome on, let's get it popping\nOver these guitars, see me spitting my scarves\nSee, it really gets hard with a felony charge\nThey send a nigga to jail, it was like living in hell\nWith that \"F\" on your record, yo, you're destined to fail\nNiggas try to get a job, they figure you rob\nSo it's back to the street life, living it odd\nYour funds go up, that's when a nigga head blow up\nUntil you floss around a wrong nigga, hair growned up\nIt's kinda strange, when I started, I was already finished\nAdapted to my enviroment, born to be a menace", "image": "https://images.genius.com/72de999ec4144de78b4aca2000e5694f.500x500x1.jpg", "artist": "ScHoolboy Q", "raw": {"annotation_count": 14,

them sneak pictures\nIn my city I'm a young God\nThat pussy kill be so vicious\nMy God white, he in my pocket\nHe get me redder than the devil 'til I go nauseous\n\nShe asked me if I do this every day, I said \"Often\"\nAsked how many times she rode the wave, \"Not so often\"\nBitches down to do it either way, often\nBaby I can make that pussy rain, often\nOften, often, girl I do this often\nMake that pussy pop and do it how I want it\nOften, often, girl I do this often\nMake that pussy pop and do it how I want it\nOften\n\nOften, often, girl I do this often\nIn that thing, switch lane to lane, look like I spent a fortune\nAwesome, 100 plus, can't this from the auction\nNeed a chick to ride my dick and back it up like parking\nShow that pussy, work that pussy\nWho that pussy, that's my pussy\nWet that pussy, stroke that pussy\nOoh! I twist the cunt\nYou on your phone texting your friend to come fuck\nI wonder if it's the druggies with hoes or the millions of bucks\nBut, ask me if I do this everyday you know\nI'm ballin', make 80k straight off the plane you know\nTrade my grill in for the Bentley or the Range you know\nI'm in the studio just tryna get some brains you know\n\nShe asked me if I do this every day, I said \"Often\"\nAsked how many times she rode the wave, \"Not so often\"\nBitches down to do it either way, often\nBaby I can make that pussy rain, often\nOften, often, girl I do this often\nMake that pussy pop and do it how I want it\nOften, often, girl I do this often\nMake that pussy pop and do it how I want it\nOften\n\nFreakier than freaky, when she climax she make pee pee\nStep back like a player, turn my cheek she try to reach me\nWhat you in this for? Another sucker for a whore\nNever I, tailored by my new young Anna Wintour\nCenterfold attraction, sexual compassion\nOften memories are faded, these are everlastin'\nLong eyelashes, palmin' her every asset\nOften imitated because this life I live is lavish\nBud like a flower, Miami's new Eiffel Tower\nLove in the dark to the beat of my heart\nShe came from the ghetto and now her closet is Neiman\nOften the results of the women joinin' my team and dreamin'\n\nOhh the Sun's rising up\nThe night's almost done\nThe night's almost done\nBut I see your eyes\nYou wanna go again\nGirl I go again\nGirl I go again\n\nShe asked me if I do this every day, I said \"Often\"\nAsked how many times she rode the wave, \"Not so often\"\nBitches down to do it either way, often\nBaby I can make that

Now depression creep\nI'm stressing deep, even in my sleep\nMy mommy call, I hit ignore\nMy daughter calls, I press ignore\nMy chin press on my chest, my knees press the floor\nI'm blanking out, woke up on the couch\nDinner on my shirt, my stomach hurts\nI had a ball sellin' 80s but yo, the karma's worse\nI cry when nothing's wrong, I'm mad when peace is involved\nMy senses harmed, sluggish ruggish\nA couple Xannies popped, open my pill box (Prescription drugs)\n\nWhat's wrong, daddy?! Wake up! Wake up!\n\nPrescription drugs, I fell in love\nMy little secret, she gon' kill a thug\nMy body numb, she like to give me hugs\nI love her touch, I get a rush\nWhen she don't come around, I start to go nuts\nMy heart erupts, I'm curled in pain\nMy phone ring, ring and ring and ring\nIf you ain't selling drugs, then I don't hear a thing\nMay 7, Ali calls, p.m. of 6:45, I finally answer this time\nHe said \"Come to the stu', I'm mixing all your rhymes\"\nI don't decline, at least that's in my mind\nGrab the keys, need some woods for the trees\nDap the clerk 'fore I leave, max on my AC\nContinue right, remember seeing light\nWise night, but that's my life (Prescription drugs)\n\nWhat's wrong?

Adderall\nXanny bars, get codeine involved\nStuck in this body high, can't shake it off\nI'm falling off, I can't hold a thought\nWhat's wrong with me? Now depression creep\nI'm stressing deep, even in my sleep\nMy mommy call, I hit ignore\nMy daughter calls, I press ignore\nMy chin press on my chest, my knees press the floor\nI'm blanking out, woke up on the couch\nDinner on my shirt, my stomach hurts\nI had a ball sellin' 80s but yo, the karma's worse\nI cry when nothing's wrong, I'm mad when peace is involved\nMy senses harmed, sluggish ruggish\nA couple Xannies popped, open my pill box (Prescription drugs)\n\nWhat's wrong, daddy?! Wake up! Wake up!\n\nPrescription drugs, I fell in love\nMy little secret, she gon' kill a thug\nMy body numb, she like to give me hugs\nI love her touch, I get a rush\nWhen she don't come around, I start to go nuts\nMy heart erupts, I'm curled in pain\nMy phone ring, ring and ring and ring\nIf you ain't selling drugs, then I don't hear a thing\nMay 7, Ali calls, p.m. of 6:45, I finally answer this time\nHe said \"Come to the stu', I'm mixing all your rhymes\"\nI don't decline, at least that's in my mind\nGrab the keys, need some woods for the trees\nDap the clerk 'fore I leave, max on my AC\nContinue right, remember seeing light\nWise night, but that's my life (Prescription drugs)\n\nWhat's wrong? You tired? You mad?

sending nickels and dimes\nMy little nigga 12, said he with it, yeah\nGave him a sherm stick and watched him while he hit it\nSoon as he lit it, cuz was finished, now cock back the gat\nLeave the mask and gloves, let's get to business\nBut they worried 'bout Osama\nKill the bitch nigga and get his family ma\u00f1ana\nDidn't get a comma, nor a cent, for the karma\nJust an imaginary stripe, so he can hold his head in honor\nZombieland, a bunch of dead men walking\nLiving abortions, they oughta raise the price on coffins\nThey fucking make a killing, but I ain't dying up in prison\nFully-loaded clip my brain up to the ceiling\n\nMoney-money, hoes, clothes, nigga that's all we know\n(On my mom and 'em)\nMurder-murder, kill get your fucking cap peeled\n(I put that on my mom and 'em)\nFear around here, I smell death around here\n(On my mom and 'em)\nDon't be snooping 'round here, get dogged around here\n(I put that on my mom and 'em)\n\nThey say 2012 the world gon' end\nShit it been over since Raymond recruited soldiers\n1969 evolution of devils time\nAin't walking up in no shrine shit, I'm living a life of crime\nPops never gave a chance my mom crying\nShe can see it in my eyes, I lost my mind\nSneaking out the window with angel dust in my Indo\nKeys to her ignition new mission ya better limbo\nFire pits let to eject I hardly miss\nNigga ditch sleep on my dog ain't that a bitch?\nAnd I ain't on my Odd Future tip\nBut snatch a nigga intestines from his nose and tell his ass to shit\nBut they worry 'bout Osama\nBlood and Crip niggas lifetime of Jeffery Dhamer\nFlashy for the moment I'm on it I pop your collar\nSuicidal ain't fucking with these young wild connivers, we rivals\n\n\nDidn't learn too much in school but I donelearned some shit\n36 a kilo, 28 grams a zip\nPot brownies and white cookies\nCops'll pat me down but won't touch on my girl's tushie\nFuck, they sent the lady cop, they tryna book me\nAll else fails, balloon packs, tampon that pussy\nBack to the set to laugh about it and get it off\nLobster tails and butter sauce, same clothes still a boss\nOn a mothafuckin' robbing spree\nProbably be televised, bitch I want the world to see\nNow you dumb fuckers heard of the\nSickest nigga out, I found out that blood's burgundy\nBut they worry 'bout Osama\n9/11 passengers ain't seen this type of drama\nVietnam wars, I'm sending copper galore\nBodies hit the floor, God knows I'm playing lord for sure\n\n\nMake money, make money-money-money\nTake money, take money-money-money\nMake money, steal money-money-money\nKill money, my money-money-money"}}, {"title": "Ride Out", "album": "Blank Face LP", "year": "2016-07-08", "lyrics": "Ride out, get smoke\nRe-up, get dough\nGs up, hoes blow\nFreeze up, eyes closed\nRide out, get

on my minibike\nEither hoop or sellin' white\nBrillo pad, the smoker's pipe\nMy pistol cocked, you tryna fight?\nSay he wanna be a cuz, put his brains to the right\nBruh, this ain't the eighties, mane, niggas shootin' everything, everything\nYou know the gang we represent\nSpecialize in pistol grips\nShootin' out my momma's whip\nAlways got an empty clip\nTop Dawg in this bitch\nNigga's puttin' dicks inside your baby momma's momma's lips\nShootin' all the witnesses, it ain't no fuckin' murder scene\nCrips don't fuck with Crips, so now his jeans that look like the rival team\nWrong hat and shoes, put your ass on a forever dream\nHeatin' up the summer 'til the winter fall, spring clean\n\nRide out, get smoke\nRe-up, get dough\nGs up, hoes blow\nFreeze up, eyes closed\nRide out,

the border, so they cliquin' up for knockin' us down\nMy burner tucked, I learned from Chuck so I ain't turnin' it down\nGet to bussin', know you bluffed it, nigga\nIf that bitch can't make me rich then ain't no need in fuckin' with her\nTurn around and fuck her sister, heard that bitch, got EBT\nLong Beach ain't seen shit like me since Tracy D and DPG\nI went and got a burner on the day they murdered Baby D\nI'm in that Benz with Lil Boy, so lil boy don't play with me\n\nHuh, I'm ridin' cycs through Hoover Street, my knuckles full of teeth\nTry to creep on me, you're dyin' in your homie's seat\nKeeping to my gun in reach, fillet the beef\nClip reach from Figg side to Norfolk Beach\nIn a stolen Expedition, in your hood cause you the mission\nBeen a mathematician, load nine, subtracted eight\nI'm keepin' one for just in case, don't cover face but I ain't trippin'\nBlunt was laced, niggas know I'm 'round the way, so ain't no liquor stores today\n\nRide out, get smoke\nRe-up, get

come back, like above your butt\nNo ifs, ands, or buts\nYou're sufficient, but I still wanna fill you up\n(When loves runs high)\nJust when you thought enough was enough\nI'm a kid in a museum and I just wanna touch\nEvery part of your body, tie you up and get naughty\nHo, we up in this party, HiiiPoWeR, money showers\nAll the ladies wanna kick it with Mr. Miyagi\nPull up, pull up, bring it back, come, rewind\nI wanna touch up and down your spine\n(When loves runs high)\nA perfect 10 living on cloud 9\n\nI like to drink all the time, fuck all the time\nAnything that can get me outta my mind\nI'm a rolling stone that needs another home, especially\n(When loves runs high)\n(Now everybody in the place!)\nToke, toke, toke, toke, toke, toke, toke, toke\n(Do it 'til you can't feel your

come back, like above your butt\nNo ifs, ands, or buts\nYou're sufficient, but I still wanna fill you up\n(When loves runs high)\nJust when you thought enough was enough\nI'm a kid in a museum and I just wanna touch\nEvery part of your body, tie you up and get naughty\nHo, we up in this party, HiiiPoWeR, money showers\nAll the ladies wanna kick it with Mr. Miyagi\nPull up, pull up, bring it back, come, rewind\nI wanna touch up and down your spine\n(When loves runs high)\nA perfect 10 living on cloud 9\n\nI like to drink all the time, fuck all the time\nAnything that can get me outta my mind\nI'm a rolling stone that needs another home, especially\n(When loves runs high)\n(Now everybody in the place!)\nToke, toke, toke, toke, toke, toke, toke, toke\n(Do it 'til you can't feel your face!)\nChug, chug, chug, chug, chug, chug, chug, chug\n(Now everybody in the place!)\nToke, toke, toke, toke, toke, toke, toke, toke\n(Do it 'til you can't feel your face!)\nChug, chug, chug, chug\n(Now stop... and just groove.)\n\nUh, faded off life\nSee the dopeman, time to get right\nOpen up a bud light\nDon Julio, coronas, comas\nBad bitches, bad bitches, call up bad bitches\nBring your friend to be a witness\n(When loves runs high)\nWhatever that mean\nNeed a shot, you the vaccine\nYou pumping through my veins\nI'm a crack fiend, you're the crack\nDrive your ass all night, meet the chauffeur\nBend you over in a rover, it's over\nNever sober my cup runneth over\n(When loves runs high)\nBetter know, girl, you fuckin' with a soldier\n\nI like to drink all the time, fuck all the time\nAnything that can get me outta my mind\nI'm a rolling stone that needs another home, especially\n(When loves runs high)\n(Now everybody in the place!)\nToke, toke, toke, toke, toke, toke, toke,

your face!)\nChug, chug, chug, chug\n(Now stop... and just groove.)\n\nBlunts and broads\nDrinking on liquor that's hard, oh my God\nBaby tryna grab my draws\nThey call me dozer, I knock down walls\nJose, that's my homie\nYeah I hear you callin' earl in the hallway\n(When loves runs high)\nI gotta come down just to party\nI'm turnt up, maxed out\nWillie Manchester, blow your back out\nBaby girl my advice, better back out\nGot that dope stick, I'm the crack house\nListen ma, I got a role you can act out\nAnd then like prince pant's get your ass out\nI don't need a princess, I need a mistress\nWhose sticking dick in a damsel in distress\n\nI like to drink all the time, fuck all the time\nAnything that can get me outta my mind\nI'm a rolling stone that needs another home,

and take a knee\nHell goes far as the eye can see, hoodies and weaponry\nNaive to being free, locked up, we chasing keys\nHow your eyes investigate us, while we look up to entertainers\nBall players, pistol bangers, big brothers, uncles, uncles\nBetrayed by a lot of homies, all my friendships stay on shuffle\nHuddles, steady find a plan, spread evil beyond the land\nAs I clench down upon this trigger, the burn fucking burn\nEvery step to getting deeper, survival my main concern\nMarinating in Satan's sweat, take a sip of this holy water\nHoping God still keep me blessed, with a dark shield for my armor\n\nWoo, woah\nWoo, woah\nWoo, woah\nWoo, woah\nNeed him in my life, put him in my life, bring him in my life\nWoo, woah\nWoo, woah\nWoo, woah\nWoo, woah\nWoo, woah\nWoo, woah\nWoo,

I promised to be loyal and honest\nPromises, man, I promised, lied on separate occasions\nPromises, man, I promised, my promises is aging\nHennessy what my system like, feeling like Superman\nI might crip tonight, I bring loss to life\nA gruesome site, look who don' got involved\nIt's no different from wars, it's kill or be called upon\nFeeling teary eyed, thinking I've gone too far\nAsk God for forgiveness, shit I doubt he heard me at all\nThey say clean your hands before you eat, rinse your sins with prayer\nBut I've done did some things I don't think I could ever wash away\n\nWoo,

locked up, we chasing keys\nHow your eyes investigate us, while we look up to entertainers\nBall players, pistol bangers, big brothers, uncles, uncles\nBetrayed by a lot of homies, all my friendships stay on shuffle\nHuddles, steady find a plan, spread evil beyond the land\nAs I clench down upon this trigger, the burn fucking burn\nEvery step to getting deeper, survival my main concern\nMarinating in Satan's sweat, take a sip of this holy water\nHoping God still keep me blessed, with a dark shield for my armor\n\nWoo, woah\nWoo, woah\nWoo, woah\nWoo, woah\nNeed him in my life, put him in my life, bring him in my life\nWoo, woah\nWoo, woah\nWoo, woah\nWoo, woah\nWoo, woah\nWoo, woah\nWoo, woah\nWoo, woah\nNeed him in my life, put him in my life, bring him in my life\nWoo, woah\nWoo, woah\nWoo, woah\nWoo, woah\n\nPromises, man, I promised, none of them goals accomplished\nPromises, man, I promised to be loyal and honest\nPromises, man, I promised, lied on separate occasions\nPromises, man, I promised, my promises is aging\nHennessy what my system like, feeling like Superman\nI might crip tonight, I bring loss to life\nA gruesome site, look who don' got involved\nIt's no different from wars, it's kill or be called upon\nFeeling teary eyed, thinking I've gone too far\nAsk God for forgiveness, shit I doubt he heard me at all\nThey say clean your hands before you eat, rinse your sins with prayer\nBut I've done did some things I don't think I could ever wash away\n\nWoo, woah\nWoo, woah\nWoo, woah\nWoo, woah\nNeed him in my life, put him in my life, bring him in my life\nWoo, woah\nWoo, woah\nWoo, woah\nWoo, woah\nWoo, woah\nWoo, woah\nWoo, woah\nWoo, woah\nNeed him in my life, put him in my life, bring him in my life\nWoo, woah\nWoo, woah\nWoo,

mall and they blow me kisses\nScratching on my balls probably caught me limping\nFigueroa boy, so you know it's pimping", "image":

fly away\nPlaya playa fly away\n\nLadies show your titties\nFreak me with your panties off\nShe heard I run the city\nAnd stay dressed in the finest clothes\nSo playeristic who be? I'm that mayne\nI tripped and stumbled into this rap game\nAnd turned my struggles into a fortune\nNo wonder why these hoes good for nothing\nJust turned me texting into some fucking\nYou know I get it, I did it way before I'm thirty\nOh I get it, now I attract to those who curvy\nOh I get it, I'm living what these niggas talking bout\nShe want a baller, a nigga that ain't in his momma's house\nKnowing he wrong, out here sneak fucking on his momma's couch\nNigga I'm grown, boy you keep playing she gon' throw you out\nSee that there ain't the life of a playa boy I tell ya\nCalling all the ladies, if you're sexy and you know it\nBring that pussy over here, I'm not a square\n\n\nAll my playa partnas ballin' stuntin' what's I call it\nAll my soldiers up but nigga we ain't fallin'\nI'm gettin' paper but I still prefer a blunt\nBackwood that good and you know my system thump\nI'm turnin, my closet be fly as hell, my soul's burnin'\nPlaya playa, on ritz is that shit we been on\nI'm at the Ritz with a big body bitch to lay on\nAin't turnin' tricks, wrappin' my dick, give her a gift\nGive her a bar, give her a spot, give her a lift\nSee life's a bitch so fuck your world while I exist\nI'm drunk and faded turning saints to lunatics\nYo what's the word?\nYo excuse me if I slur, but you need what you deserve\nCalling all the ladies, if you're sexy and you know it\nGive this playa here your rear\nNow drop it for me, pause for me\n\n\nSippin' Henn, no ice cause I ain't tryin' to chill\nEverybody taking molly, I'm still off a pill\nStraight up off of Figg into a record deal\nFuck paying a tuition, rather pay these bills\nGo from bank to bank and state to state for shows\nTwo chicks go mouth to mouth to make my penis grow\nI don't care about nothin' but pussy hoes\nSo now you frontin' why you playin' with that pussy fo'?\nTo my playas don't you hate a reform ho?\nTryin' to act like that my nigga Soul ain't hit before\nShe fucked K.Dot, even let Jay rock\nGoing nowhere fast in the same spot\nIt's a party over here, nothin' goin' over there\nCalling all the ladies\nIf you're horny and you know it give that one you want a stare\nNow drop it for me,

enterprise, marchin' in these Chucks like they boots\nMoney make a pussy get the juice\nMoney make the copper give a pass\nMoney make me cop a bigger roof\nMoney got me skippin' every class\nTryna kill 'em for the summer\nThe teachers ain't teachin', the judge taught us numbers\nWe was raised by single mothers\nPops wouldn't tuck us under covers\nThrough the streets we learned colors\nHiding from the reaper tryna' dodge the cage\nThis shit I've done to rhyme on this stage\nI went from king of the corner\nTo breaking down weed on my diploma\nStraight ballin' like a bitch\n\nPicture me rollin', ooh\nStraight outta the ghetto to a deluxe apartment in the sky\nStraight ballin' like a bitch\nPicture me rollin', ooh, yea\nI used to smoke bush, now all this kush got me so high\nYeah, so high, so high\nI used to smoke bush, now all this kush got me so high\nStraight ballin' like a bitch\nSo high\nStraight ballin' like a bitch\nSo high\nStraight ballin' like a bitch\nStraight ballin' like a bitch\nStraight ballin' like a bitch", "image": "https://images.genius.com/2d03dd3816b9f03a303110b5628e696c.1000x1000x1.jpg", "artist": "ScHoolboy Q", "raw": {"annotation_count": 21,

wrist\nTold me we could never get rich\nNow watch me ride the Chevy hit the switch\nStraight ballin' like a bitch\nAye, riding through the city on chrome\nGhetto nigga out the sunroof, hey, foreign keys bitch please\nStraight ballin' like a bitch\nFlossin' in the mind, stuntin' like the first, shufflin' the work\nUh, I done came from the dirt\nNow the engine make the tire go skrrt\nUsed to sleep with roaches crackhead uncle and all\nNow a hundred thousand just a hour involved\nSo easy how I make a mill' flip\nSnoop ain't the only rich crip, nigga\nFrom sleepin' on Tops couch to multiple bank accounts\nTo havin' me a mall for house\nThey tried to slim my chances as kid though\nThey always said I'd never make it big though\nStraight ballin' like a bitch\n\nPicture me rollin', ooh\nStraight outta the ghetto to a deluxe apartment in the sky\nStraight ballin' like a bitch\nPicture me rollin', ooh, yea\nI used to smoke bush, now all this kush got me so high\nYeah, so high, so high\nI used to smoke bush, now all this kush got me so high\nStraight ballin' like a bitch\nSo high\nStraight ballin' like a bitch\nSo high\nStraight ballin' like a bitch\nStraight ballin' like a bitch\nStraight ballin' like a bitch\n\nAye, wait, waitin' on my turn to get paid\nNigga trying to make a mill' a day\nPut that rental on in the interstate\nSince a youngin' I was gifted\nMomma bought me some things for the bitches\nBruh, I go through some things you gotta witness\nStomach get to mumblin' at night\nWatchin' every car that drive by, lookin' every driver in the eye\n52nd enterprise, marchin' in these Chucks like they boots\nMoney make a pussy get the juice\nMoney make the copper give a pass\nMoney make me cop a bigger roof\nMoney got me skippin' every class\nTryna kill 'em for the summer\nThe teachers ain't teachin', the judge taught us numbers\nWe was raised by single mothers\nPops wouldn't tuck us under covers\nThrough the streets we learned colors\nHiding from the reaper tryna' dodge the cage\nThis shit I've done to rhyme on this stage\nI went from king of the corner\nTo breaking down weed on my diploma\nStraight ballin' like a bitch\n\nPicture me rollin', ooh\nStraight outta the ghetto to a deluxe apartment in the sky\nStraight ballin' like a bitch\nPicture me rollin', ooh, yea\nI used to smoke bush, now all this kush got me so high\nYeah, so high, so high\nI used to smoke bush, now all this kush got me so high\nStraight ballin' like a bitch\nSo high\nStraight ballin' like a bitch\nSo high\nStraight ballin' like a bitch\nStraight ballin' like a bitch\nStraight ballin' like a bitch"}}, {"title": "Studio", "album": "Oxymoron", "year": "2014-02-25", "lyrics": "I'm just sittin' in the studio just tryna get to you, baby\nBut this song so fuckin'

know who you are, but I'm really late night in the stu'\nGot a call from my dog Q, for the G-Mix now let's groove\nPussy stock going up, I think it's all of these checks\nI think it's cause you love yourself a smooth thug dude from the 'jects\nWhen Belly's on TV the only time that I receive your texts\nShit I must be poppin', got so many options\nTall models, short models, big girls to coke bottles\nChurch girls to bad bitches, I'm interviewing, holla\n\n(I'm just sittin' in the studio just tryna get to you, baby)\nBut this song so fuckin' dope, girl, it's harder not for me to blaze it\nTo tell the truth, wish it was you in this booth that I was blazin'\nSo I'm just sittin' in the studio just tryna get to you, baby\n\nYou need a real nigga, shorty so come in, throw that pussy, shorty\nSee I think you and me can make it, this little verse to get you naked\nSee, your heart ain't meant for breaking, Cupid's never been mistaken\nSee, I been caught up in the moment, shit, my type ain't quite her type\nBut now this gangsta nigga on it, she can twist my weed and hit the 'yac\nI can hit your type without the hat, put that pussy on the map\nI see qualities in a bad girl, I know that ass you got\nCome with attitude and your swag, girl, you ain't wrong, girl\nJust when that door knock lose your thong, girl\nCause you girl, cause you girl, girl, cause you girl, girl\n\n\nThrow a loc your pussy, girl, you knowing that your nigga faded\nCan I hit that pussy way I wanna while this record playing?\nPut my tongue in different places, play a game of Operation\nNa-na-na, la-la, la-la, you get what I'm saying\nNo metaphors, nothing like that\nI'm keeping it straight to the point with you\nI'mma put this dick up all in-side-of-you"}}, {"title":

day\nPrayin' to the Lord, hope to call me up today\nSell dope for a rainy day, but the pigs love to keep the boy afraid\nSo I... smoke to take the pain away\nSo I... smoke to take the pain away\nHell yeah I'm feeling made tonight\nJust got 20 dollars getting blazed tonight, right\n\nI'm just happy just to wake up\nWithout a dime can't put the folgers in the cup\nTried to get a buck, so I hit a little slut\nPhone turned off, can't even hit her up\nA nigga feeling kinda stressed out\nWalk down the block see my nigga stretched out\nCan't even pout, more to reminisce about\nPaying my condolences up at his sister house\nHeading to the laundromat to wash a little clothes\nInstrumental playin' kick a little flows\nSay whats up to my bro's\nWhatup groove, cuz all of that\nAnyway I'm headin' to the drier after that see my supplier\nShit, hopefully a nigga come up on some fire\nBut remember not a dime on me\nTryna get a dime homie\nI swear to God, I ain't lyin' homie\n\nI'm just hoping for a better day\nPrayin' to the Lord, hope to call me up today\nSell dope for a rainy day, but the pigs love to keep the boy afraid\nSo I... smoke to take the pain away\nSo I... smoke to take the pain away\nHell yeah I'm feeling made tonight\nJust got 20 dollars getting blazed tonight, right\n\nSometimes I wanna call my momma up\nBut every time I call seems she don't give a fuck\nI guess its just the luck, people always leave me stuck\nWanna break down but gotta keep pushin' up\nWhat the fuck a only child can do\nGramds passed away, mom's said go on through\nOnly thing I got is my girl and my dogs\nSwear to god i don't wanna lose it all\nI got homies, I don't think they ridin' to the end\nNiggas fake as fuck lookin' past all they grins\nJust tryna get some ends, hopefully can get a Benz\nAnd I'll do the shit (??) just to keep them niggas in\nI just need a lil bread bro\nTryna pay my momma hopefully get a kiss yo\nThis shit can really make you sick though\nI just wanna go....\n\nI'm just hoping for a better day\nPrayin' to the Lord, hope to call me up today\nSell dope for a rainy day, but the pigs love to keep the boy afraid\nSo I... smoke to take the pain away\nSo I... smoke to take the pain away\nHell yeah I'm feeling made tonight\nJust got 20 dollars getting blazed tonight, right\n\nI don't see how you niggas do it\nSaying cuz/blood, little nigga sound foolish\nLittle nigga murdered, hangin' out at Fat Burger\nAnother tattoo, time to take the beef further\nRan down the block, thought I heard a couple shots\nMade it to the scene, another nigga off the team\nBack to gettin' cream, still relyin' on the fiends\nWish I could take it back to when a nigga had a dream\nBut gangbangin' love to enter nigga's lifes\nSo your life ain't right\nYoung gauge earnin' strips (?)\nStarted puffin drugs then you start sayin cuhz\nDidn't have a choice that's the way shit was\nI swear I need to set it to the side\nBut when I hear Pac make a nigga wanna ride\nI guess I'm a hypocrite, still hangin' with the Hipper Crips\n\nI'm just hoping for a better day\nPrayin' to the Lord, hope to call me up today\nSell dope for a rainy day, but the pigs love to keep the boy afraid\nSo I... smoke to take the pain away\nSo I... smoke to take the pain away\nHell yeah I'm feeling made tonight\nJust got 20 dollars getting blazed tonight, right", "image":

but I ain't sayin' (Nada)\nPeep, 24/7 in the hood it's hot\nIf you wanna fall through, get Top on the phone\nHe don't pick up then it ain't bool\nLet you know it ain't good to stop\nThat part, that part (That part)\nI'm a Watts nigga and we not kosher\nShit, niggas only concern is the bottom line like a stockholder\nThis is where they come, where they cop them boulders\nHoes catfight with their tits exposed\nStill sippin' on that Wild Irish Rose\nStill rock swap meet designer clothes (Ah!)\nBlack MAC 11 in my mattress (Wooh!)\nMake a hundred racks do a backflip (Wooh!)\nMight go Uncle Luke

mattress that we bench press\nPC, get the Fruit Loops\nKeep tellin' on niggas, why I fuck with that nigga?\nNigga made bail but I'm still at rage\nShould I thank God for the hell I raised?\nCause the

bang at the King parade\nI can take you spots where gangsters walk\nThe real damus and locs, Boyz N the Hood wasn't even close\nWhere the girls' kitten show, hit the dope and the pussy soaked\nNow she get you for your change, Captain Save-A-Homie\nI ain't been right since out the cervix\nI know a M can make it perfect\nIt came through more than the one I worship\nYou know I never lie, the truth be told, the dope, it gettin' sold\nHe got the runny nose\nSummertime, we don't trust niggas in winter clothes\nI swear the hood low, as the burner get rolls I follow the city codes\nMy money short\nMissin' the days of honey oats\nDollar bills in mama's coat\nCartoons and bubble soap\nThis be the realest shit I wrote\nThis be that ride that hunnid spoke\nRed and blue from head to toe\n\nWho needs a mothafuckin' friend?\nYou see them mothafuckin' rims\nMet the devil in disguise\nLook through my mothafuckin' eyes\n\nLook at my yard, look at my block\nLook at my zipcode\nAll of these lies, true to my life\nWord to my pencil\nTake what you want, get what you like\nOpen that window\nAin't that simple?\nAin't it that simple?\nLook through my mothafuckin' eyes\nVision impaired by the high\nNo cares on my mind\nCouple days, I'll be fine\n\nThis shit from 'round the back house\nMore baggies bagged than at Ralphs\nIn granny's plastic suede couch\nBest play cat and that mouse\nA minor pitchin' in major\nStay servin' dope but we cater\nTake you back to my Sega\nSlammin' bones on that table\nRunnin' errands for grams, the paramedics at Tam's\nForced to grow to a man\nBefore L.A. had them Rams\nWent to school for the bitches, where scorin' drugs was the goal\nLungs black as a crow, got banned from every hood store\nMy haters came for the better and money came for the loads\nConcrete where we rose, you wasn't built from this mold\nFucked up the game with many flow\nI've been a loc since embryo\nI'm ten toes, you movie role\nI do this shit for lifers way before\nJehri curls, cut Dickies and sherm smoke\nGot so many bodies the world knows, shit\nDon't worry 'bout no witness, your homies go under oath\nBut our dreams was big, homie\nThe world done flipped on me, took my soul then clicked on me\n\nWho needs a mothafuckin' friend?\nYou see my mothafuckin' rims\nMet the devil in disguise\nLook through my mothafuckin' eyes\n\nLook at my yard, look at my block\nLook at my zip code\nAll of these lies, true to my life\nWord to my pencil\nTake what you want, get what you like\nOpen that window\nAin't that simple?\nAin't it that simple?\nLook

on point\nI could be here all day if you let me go, go, go, go\nOh, lord!\nYou don't know the half of what I had to hold, hold, hold, hold\nNo, lord!\nI see faces at my window\nMy patience growin' short\nI had no one to lend on\nThat's why that chip is so cold\nKinda like the cocaine on my fallen bros, bros, bros, bros\nOh, lord!\nGuess that's my curtain call, my last go\nAin't this shit what

\"Fuck the blogs\"\nThe afterbell, we hang in halls\nUnderage, smokin' weed and alcohol\nGrandma sweeped shells out the driveway\nOne of the homies got slayed so we bang at the King parade\nI can take you spots where gangsters walk\nThe real damus and locs, Boyz N the Hood wasn't even close\nWhere the girls' kitten show, hit the dope and the pussy soaked\nNow she get you for your change, Captain Save-A-Homie\nI ain't been right since out the cervix\nI know a M can make it perfect\nIt came through more than the one I worship\nYou know I never lie, the truth be told, the dope, it gettin' sold\nHe got the runny nose\nSummertime, we don't trust niggas in winter clothes\nI swear the hood low, as the burner get rolls I follow the city codes\nMy money short\nMissin' the days of honey oats\nDollar bills in mama's coat\nCartoons and bubble soap\nThis be the realest shit I wrote\nThis be that ride that hunnid spoke\nRed and blue from head to toe\n\nWho needs a mothafuckin' friend?\nYou see them mothafuckin' rims\nMet the devil in disguise\nLook through my mothafuckin' eyes\n\nLook at my yard, look at my block\nLook at my zipcode\nAll of these lies, true to my life\nWord to my pencil\nTake what you want, get what you like\nOpen that window\nAin't that simple?\nAin't it that simple?\nLook through my mothafuckin' eyes\nVision impaired by the high\nNo cares on my mind\nCouple days, I'll be fine\n\nThis shit from 'round the back house\nMore baggies bagged than at Ralphs\nIn granny's plastic suede couch\nBest play cat and that mouse\nA minor pitchin' in major\nStay servin' dope but we cater\nTake you back to my Sega\nSlammin' bones on that table\nRunnin' errands for grams, the paramedics at Tam's\nForced to grow to a man\nBefore L.A. had them Rams\nWent to school for the bitches, where scorin' drugs was the goal\nLungs black as a crow, got banned from every hood store\nMy haters came for the better and money came for the loads\nConcrete where we rose, you wasn't built from this mold\nFucked up the game with many flow\nI've been a loc since embryo\nI'm ten toes, you movie role\nI do this shit for lifers way before\nJehri curls, cut Dickies and sherm smoke\nGot so many bodies the world knows, shit\nDon't worry 'bout no witness, your homies go under oath\nBut our dreams was big, homie\nThe world done flipped on me, took my soul then clicked on me\n\nWho needs a mothafuckin' friend?\nYou see my mothafuckin' rims\nMet the devil in disguise\nLook through my mothafuckin' eyes\n\nLook at my yard, look at my block\nLook at my zip code\nAll of these lies, true to my life\nWord to my pencil\nTake what you want, get what you like\nOpen that window\nAin't that simple?\nAin't it that simple?\nLook through my mothafuckin'

here all day if you let me go, go, go, go\nOh, lord!\nYou don't know the half of what I had to hold, hold, hold, hold\nNo, lord!\nI see faces at my window\nMy patience growin' short\nI had no one to lend on\nThat's why that chip is so cold\nKinda like the cocaine on my fallen bros, bros, bros, bros\nOh, lord!\nGuess that's my curtain call, my last go\nAin't this shit what you wanted to

by the day\nThey hydroplanin'\nThey hopin' that they catch they big break\nWhat are you sayin'?\nI feel I'm the one like a magician\nWith a stick inside his hand of a name of a messy cane\nI gets ignorant with you\nSnap your picture, bitch, I'm famous\nI came in this world with nuts in my palm\nAnd drinkin' Paul Masson\nIn a stolen Cavalier like I took LeBron\nLocked him in a basement and amputated his shootin' arm\nNow that's a stretch, Ab-Soul\nLike the fifty-mile strip when I'm pimpin' these hoes\nCall me Dolemite, no, I take that back\nFound out he gay as a  or the way that they rap\n\nI wish I had the very first verse I wrote\nI'd spit it right now\nSo you can see the vast progression and the style\nStarted as a child\nNow I'm a grown man like Benjamin Button in his fifties\nFuck with me\nStill ain't learnt the power of a dollar, disregardin' Fif'\nNot cause I don't like him, just cause I don't save shit\nSo high on my horse\nIf I fall off I get kicked by a hoof 'fore I hit the hood\nAnd that was over they head, but I wish a nigga would\nDisrespect my intellect, I'm a cocky individual\nNo subliminals, try to attack and I'll react like chemicals\nThe doc should've brought him some of my mom's inner tubes\nCause now I'm in the view of millions, takin' interviews\nI got interludes better than your singles\nWon't stop till I got a better reason to \nAnd if any of y'all want a piece of the God\nOn 12/25 we send grief to your squad\nThe only problem I got now is label offers on the table\nLike a table cloth is but I'm cautious\nI'm like what Jaws is to crawfish\nThe big shot, that's why I talk my shit\nThat's why they on my dick\nLike them little tricks that I taught your bitch\nShe'd probably lick it if I unzipped these Dickies\nYou need to quit it, knock it off\nI'm in your girl ear like a cotton swab\nAnd anythin' I say, I'm a blame it on that alcohol\nLike T-Pain on a song with Jamie Foxx\nI'm here cause it's my time, you came to watch\nEvery day it's ceramics class, pass the pot", "image": "https://images.rapgenius.com/45efd40fd627a8f9c163ec2fd242c8e0.1000x1000x1.jpg", "artist": "ScHoolboy Q", "raw": {"annotation_count": 0,

bucket, this nine holds a good dozen\nMight slide up in your cousin, just made a mil' and still thuggin'\nNiggas banged on me, but they should've shot me\nSee, I hit the corner then spot him, got him\nCourt date, but I skipped the bail, rather wig myself before I sit in jail\nNeed a gang of weed and a pint of lean, got a hat say Figg', on my gangsta tip\nDon't trust no ho, I might sock the bitch, I'm apocalypse, to your politics\nMight cop the Phantom, get ghost, I can pay your bills with this coat\nNeed an extra band for this smoke, I can see for miles with this scope, nigga\nGot an oxy-scribed to this dope dealer, Misses Piggy, want a piggyback\nRock cremation, then called it crack, I'mma keep on eating, 'til my ankles fat\nSell that fix, throw it cross the map, push my penis in between her lap\nPut my semen all down her throat, 'til Tito kilos come off that boat\n\nThis the shit that they want\nThis the shit that they need\nTell me where are you from?\nDrop your pants to your knees, girl, I'm capital G\nThis the shit they gon' buy\nThis the shit why I'm fly, this the shit why I'm high\nThis the shit they gon' bump\nThis the shit that they want, this the shit that they want\n\nTell 'em, tell 'em, tell 'em\nIf you see my watch I might hit it\nIf you see my check I might hit it\nIf you see my house I might hit it\nThis the shit that they want\nThis the shit that they need, this the shit that's from me\nThis the shit they gon' bump\nThis the shit that they want, this the shit that they want\n\nYeah, this that four niggas in a Regal flow\nSpeeding through the yellow lights\nTreat my Versace belt like it's a mistletoe\nI put everything over yellow rice, graduated from hella ice\nIf I stand on my bank roll (stand on your bank roll), nigga, I'd be scared of heights\nAnd I'd be dodging the police, when I was poor with no lights\nWhen I was poor with potential, watch my flow in four inches\nOh Lord, she in Christians, all gold for my Adventist\nPulled it down and she kissed it, all gold where my wrists is\nGod'll judge, no conviction\nJust because I got dreads don't get it twisted\nMoving my whip down the boulevard\nWord round town, I was selling hard\nHard and I'm talking bout the yayo\nHit her on the floor and then I lay low\nAmigos say \"Que pasa with the pesos?\"\nPromethazine codeine, caseloads (T.R.U.)\nAnd when I pull up to the valet, you know I got the strippers on payroll!\n\nThis the shit that they want\nThis the shit that they need\nTell me where are you from?\nDrop your pants to your knees, girl, I'm capital G\nThis the shit

the floor, it won't stop\nAnd just when you thought it won't drop, Oxymoron in stores\nCome in kids, lock the door, knock-knock-knock, hit the floor\nNeed my bread off the top,could buy anything off the lot\nThis that steel, not the grill,get them slugs off for real\nThis that curl with the gel,we gon' win, smoke the L's\nShe love my mic, rock the bell,leave that punani killed\nAll them hoes run to Q,spit that truth,make the loot\nExpensive whips we hotbox, spent 2 bills on my socks\nThis that make you cockblock, this that make me pop shot\nThis that filthy convo, this that must be Figueroa\n\nThis the shit that they want\nThis the shit that they need\nTell me where are you from?\nDrop your pants to your knees, girl, I'm capital G\nThis the shit they gon' buy\nThis the shit why I'm fly, this the shit why I'm high\nThis the shit they gon' bump\nThis the shit that they want, this the shit that they want\n\nTell 'em, tell 'em, tell 'em\nIf you see my watch I might hit it\nIf

a drug dealing nigga, 'cause them grades ain't get me paid\nMy agenda for today is to make bread or get laid\nSee my daughter need some shoes and my mom work overtime\nSo I'm standing by that stop sign with nickels and them dimes\nKeep that work, got that Oxy, need that kilo, call that papi\nKnow my steelo, shrimp with sake, sold that her-on, look like toffee\nKeep my nina, just might off him, no them boys on Figg don't play\nMost my life on 51st, went to school on 52nd\nUsed to fight on 49th, Grandma said be home by night\nBut her old ass sixty-something, so three hours late aight\nStill I love her, R.I.P., when she died, I took her place\nAnd became a fucking G, moved my crack across the street\n\nFigg get it, get it, yeah\nDrug dealing nigga (YAWK, YAWK, YAWK)\n\nHad pistols in my

(That yay-yay)\n\nI'm a drug dealing nigga, roll my cyc' on Hoover Street\nJust a year after Pac died we all bump Suga Free\nDidn't know what he was saying 'til them years done jumped to three\nLearned the game, slanging hoes and every car door need a key\nCharge them smokers day through night; selling pies, who need a slice?\nLife is craps so shoot the dice, get the cheese but cut the mice\nEnemies be left to right, we don't call our shit the trap\nBitch we call our shit the set, unless we OD with Reynold's Wrap\nAfter crack it's Oxy next, but thank God the yay was yay\nOff the yee like it's the bay, rock a chain I'm Kunta K\nOut in Texas what's the word, keep them packs and that's for sure\nSlang to him and slang to her, ask a fiend they will concur\n\nFigg get it, get it, yeah\nDrug dealing nigga (YAWK, YAWK, YAWK)\n\nHad pistols in my hands, had pockets full of Oxy's\nWhole life I been a G, had bitches on the block\nHad strippers on the pole, had cocaine in the

had bitches on the block\nHad strippers on the pole, had cocaine in the pot\nGot fiends at the door, so I turned that to a rock\n\nThat yay-yay (That yay-yay) That yay-yay (That yay-yay)\nThat yay-yay (That yay-yay) That yay-yay (That yay-yay)\nThat yay-yay (That yay-yay) That yay-yay (That yay-yay)\nThat yay-yay (That yay-yay) That yay-yay (That yay-yay)\n\nI'm a drug dealing nigga, 'cause them grades ain't get me paid\nMy agenda for today is to make bread or get laid\nSee my daughter need some shoes and my mom work overtime\nSo I'm standing by that stop sign with nickels and them dimes\nKeep that work, got that Oxy, need that kilo, call that papi\nKnow my steelo, shrimp with sake, sold that her-on, look like toffee\nKeep my nina, just might off him, no them boys on Figg don't play\nMost my life on 51st, went to school on 52nd\nUsed to fight on 49th, Grandma said be home by night\nBut her old ass sixty-something, so three hours late aight\nStill I love her, R.I.P., when she died, I took her place\nAnd became a fucking G, moved my crack across the street\n\nFigg get it, get it, yeah\nDrug dealing nigga (YAWK, YAWK, YAWK)\n\nHad pistols in my hands, had pockets full of Oxy's\nWhole life I been a G, had bitches on the block\nHad strippers on the pole, had cocaine in the pot\nGot fiends at the door, so I turned that to a rock\n\nThat yay-yay (That yay-yay) That

a drug dealing nigga, roll my cyc' on Hoover Street\nJust a year after Pac died we all bump Suga Free\nDidn't know what he was saying 'til them years done jumped to three\nLearned the game, slanging hoes and every car door need a key\nCharge them smokers day through night; selling pies, who need a slice?\nLife is craps so shoot the dice, get the cheese but cut the mice\nEnemies be left to right, we don't call our shit the trap\nBitch we call our shit the set, unless we OD with Reynold's Wrap\nAfter crack it's Oxy next, but thank God the yay was yay\nOff the yee like it's the bay, rock a chain I'm Kunta K\nOut in Texas what's the word, keep them packs and that's for sure\nSlang to him and slang to her, ask a fiend they will concur\n\nFigg get it, get it, yeah\nDrug dealing nigga (YAWK, YAWK, YAWK)\n\nHad pistols in my hands, had pockets full of Oxy's\nWhole life I been a G, had bitches on the block\nHad strippers on the pole, had cocaine in the pot\nGot fiends at the door, so I turned that to a rock\n\nThat yay-yay (That yay-yay) That yay-yay (That yay-yay)\nThat yay-yay (That yay-yay) That yay-yay (That yay-yay)\nThat yay-yay (That yay-yay) That yay-yay (That yay-yay)\nThat
