Hyundai\nNo tassel in the spring, but after summer I'm alumni\nThey took my nigga one night, and I was standing right there\nAn inch away from Heaven, a million songs from right here\nA step away from South by, a swing away from Cali\nA hook away from verses, I'm a dad away from rapping\nSo at the school they arrested him\nBack seat, squad car, nestled in\nShouts to the bitch nigga Heselton\nWit' his Big Show body ass wrestlin'\nFinna see the 10Day Pestilence\nSo far, so good, so special and\nNo stars, good jobs, or excellents\nAnd I'm still so fucking non-echelon\nOoohh you got suspended, ooohh you not gon' finish\nOoohh you look familiar, ooohh you look like Kenneth\nDamn they gon' resent it, ooohh you representin'\nA class of bad kids, 14,400 minutes, ahhh!\n\nIGH!

that 10Day done in one night, Honda from a Hyundai\nNo tassel in the spring, but after summer I'm alumni\nThey took my nigga one night, and I was standing right there\nAn inch away from Heaven, a million songs from right here\nA step away from South by, a swing away from Cali\nA hook away from verses, I'm a dad away from rapping\nSo at the school they arrested him\nBack seat, squad car, nestled in\nShouts to the bitch nigga Heselton\nWit' his Big Show body ass wrestlin'\nFinna see the 10Day Pestilence\nSo far, so good, so special and\nNo stars, good jobs, or excellents\nAnd I'm still so fucking non-echelon\nOoohh you got suspended, ooohh you not gon' finish\nOoohh you look familiar, ooohh you look like Kenneth\nDamn they gon' resent it, ooohh you representin'\nA class of bad kids,

You've been here before.\nChance The Rapper: Yea this is where we did a lot of the Surf album and a lot of songs for Coloring Book.\nZL: That's right, Pharrell does some recording here as well as Beats 1 and this is a place with rich history and so we're here today to talk about music and it's the first time we've had a chance to properly sit down and meet and hang out. It feels good to finally meet you and especially now that you've dropped this amazing record and the reviews are coming in left, right and centre and I don't know if you pay much attention to those things, if anyone's even given you a headline I mean they're universally acclaimed.\nCTR: That's dope, I mean I haven't read 'em all but I did see a bunch of them that were really nice and broke it down in a cool way.\nZL: You seem really well, very healthy obviously there was some concern and you had to come out and say look I've been under the weather, you were hospitalised at one point, I think you said it was pneumonia, like what was that about?\nCTR: I don't know, I just get really sick I think I need to like, just take better care of myself, I just, I try and push it as far as I can\nZL: I wondered if it was a creative consumption, the stress\nCTR: Yea you know that and also I get tonsillitis a lot, I don't know I just get sick very easily, I'm just like Mr. Glass, I don't know. I was sick and I'm getting better.\nZL: What's the pressure like when it came to finishing the record, like how close did it come to the moment when it was finally released on that Thursday evening American time and when did you actually hand it in?\nCTR: We were to the limit, like we were able to still turn in the album to our friends over at Apple on time, or a little bit behind time actually cause\nZL: Well what is time actually these days anyways?\nCTR: I know! It's a new idea to me also I think just turning in music for somebody to try and post it in a certain time and space. I've worked with end dates before like I had announced Acid Rap but we were in the studio until we posted it.\nZL: And it was self-imposed\nCTR: Yea, so it was kinda the same thing with Coloring Book it was just a little more stressful because of, I think the environment that we created in that studio because there were so many different people working on it and everybody was sleeping at the studio, we had all the inflatable beds there. It was like twenty people all living out of the studio space, along with me and my girlfriend and my daughter and I think that, there was a lot of, you know, just fatigue and tension and you know, I think adrenaline of all of it like boiling down, minute by minute and, like the last time that we played it before we turned it in we were like it's perfect, it's cool.\nZL: Hahaha I just think lyrically like the way you opened up Acid Rap you talk about how rap's made you anxious and acid made you crazy. And then on this one you go straight in you're like talking about fatherhood and marriage and it's like wow, what a difference two or three years can make. Have you had enough perspective since you released Coloring Book to be able to realise the journey that you've been on? I know you threw it all into the album but now you've had a week or so to process that and you see how much life has changed.\nCTR: Yea, I think that's the scariest part is not having the album to focus on as much because all of the real world problems aren't there you know. So me, you know, not paying attention to my health for months on months on end, you know, it's like all in your face or you know what I'm saying, your relationships, or\nZL: You've got real life to deal with now!\nCTR: Yea! Real life is like\nZL: You had a great excuse before! You could go three days without answering a call now it's like, what's your excuse now Chance?\nCTR: Exactly.\nZL: Haha, let's talk now about the themes of the record a bit, and the one that really jumps out to me, you know, is the relationship between art, music, faith and devotion right and the way that you brought church and religion to the record and we're gonna talk about that. But I want, you know, first of all on this record one of the first major statements that you make you know is that music's all we got. Now, this is something that we've all thrown around in various conversations because, either be in a lighthearted way like \"music's all I know, it's all I'm passionate about\" but this has more urgency to it and I wonder you know what the deeper meaning was, to you with that lyric that you and Kanye share on that opening track.\nCTR: Well that, \"music is all we got\" is Kanye's lyric, right? So that record  is perfect because it wasn't the first record that we made for it but just like \"Good Ass Intro\" it ended up being kinda like the thesis of the project right. So, I had made a lot of records and I have a record called \"Finish Line\" that was gonna be the intro, and\nZL: That's crazy to think about that now\nCTR: Yea it's, that was a weird sequencing, I'm glad that's not how it ended up being, but that record is so much of the record because it talks about faith, it talks about, you know, there's other blessings in the world and on the album but, you know, at the end of the day music is what we have, you know what I'm saying, and you know we're blessed at all times but you know, waiting on your blessing or thinking that your blessing is in an album is not what it is, you know what I'm saying? It's, there is no higher miracle in this project or in any of the material things in the world, but the materials do exist. So the music is what we have, and I remember I flew out to L.A., this was only like two months ago and I met up with Donnie Trumpet and Nate Fox who made most of the music that I make and they, actually I wanna play it for you. So I had, I dunno how it's gonna sound in the interview but we had, they had a record that they were working on with\nZL: We're gonna record this anyway so we can put the real audio through\nCTR: Ok, perfect. So, I was working on, or they were working on this record with Grace Weber who I am in love with, both musically and otherwise she's the best, and she, they had written the song for her for her album and she, and they played it for me and it sounded like this at first\nChance plays demo version of \"All We Got\"\nCTR: Actually I haven't heard this in a long time! Right? Crazy! So the kicks were so different and it was so dancey\nZL: Yea, totally! It's way more uptempo and way more dancey\nCTR: And, I remember when it got to this part where it says \"woah, woah, woah, uh, uh, uh, uhhhh, uhhhh\" but I heard this and was like this is, this is it.\nZL: Just that moment\nCTR: After that I was like that's exactly what I need. So I was out here because Kanye had called me when I was in Chicago and said \"I wanna help you in whatever way I can\" and\nZL: This was, what was the timeline of\nCTR: This was two months ago\nZL: Whoa so your work on Pablo is done\nCTR: My work on Pablo is done and I'm working on my project now. I put a lot of time and effort into that album and learned a lot and gained a lot outta that and, but I think that there was a lot that Kanye had to do on his front, the same place that I am right now, where he was like ok, all my personal life and all the other things that I need to do\nZL: I need to let it go, I wanna get back in the process\nCTR: Exactly. So he hit me and he said \"I got you, I want you to come out for four days.\" And so like I said I got in, I went straight over to Nico's spot and they played me that record and I was like yo, I know this is for Grace, I need this. I need you guys to help make this work for me. And I asked them if it was ok if I brought it by Kanye. They said cool. So we all went over to Kanye's spot and within a few hours of sitting around and having all these deep conversations, cause that's what Kanye does is he, he does lectures and shit and they're all, they're all like very insightful and important and helped me out a lot and, but after about two hours of being there\nChance's phone rings\nCTR: Aw sorry, my baby mama's FaceTiming me, I'll take it later. Ok I will real quick\nZL: Go for it\nCTR: Let's see, aw my baby's in it too. Hey, I'm in this interview right now can I call you back babe? (Oh I'm sorry) It's ok love, bye. Um, now I can't remember cause she's gorgeous.\nZL: Exactly, exactly! Haha and therein lies the perspective of life, and therein lies, \"all of this is total bullshit\"\nCTR: At all times haha\nZL: So you're hanging out with Kanye, he's giving you the deepness\nCTR: I almost forgot, so he basically asked us to pull up the track, we pull it up, he starts doing his Kanye dance to it and he's like \"Ok, I fuck with it, take off all the drums.\" So I'm like \"Ok, I don't really know what, what that means but we'll take off the drums.\" So now it's just horns, synth and Ye says uh, \"pull out the MPC.\" So they bring out this MPC, almost like in like the gold suitcase, like from Pulp Fiction-\nZL: Ahhhh! Like Indiana Jones\nCTR: like with just the . And they put it on the table and he records drums in a way that I've never seen before he does everything live off the MPC. So, all of his patterns that you know he's-\nZL: So he's recording it like an organic drum kit, \nCTR: Exactly, but that makes, you know. As it plays now, the drums aren't like mixed separately it's like, all the kicks, all the hi-hats everything are at the same level and shit. But he does it literally in one take, so from top to bottom he goes, you know, he just stands there and just plays through it and plays all the drums that you hear on the track as they are now. And then less than 5 seconds after he does that one take through he goes through and freestyles over it.\nPart 2. 10:00 to 20:47\nCTR: There's this guy named Francis Starlite, who's\nZL: Francis And The Lights\nCTR: Francis And The Lights, my god\nZL: Who by the way, vocally on this record shines and adds a texture of emotion that is just out of control\nCTR: That's the one perpetual thing through the album that's just, is him and, I've heard a lot of sounds with harmoniser right, so one of my favourite things that I see on the internet is people commenting on the album as, you know, whenever they talk about this vocal sound that he's created they call it auto-tune. Or they say this sounds a lot like Bon Iver. Justin \nZL: And he can play any note\nCTR: Yea and he just builds a choir around it and it sounds like\nZL: Is that what happens at the end of \"All We Got\" as well so when it changes\nCTR: That's him. So let me play you this freestyle that I got cause this is still crazy to me to this day\nChance plays second demo of \"All We Got\"\nZL: How long have you known Francis for?\nCTR: So me and Francis met in, I wanna say 2013, maybe 2014, right after I dropped Acid Rap, I've always been a fran, a fan of Francis. These are those loud ass drums he put on here.\nZL: \nCTR: You know what I'm saying? This is just him, at the board, like this, like... So this vocal is solo right? And then... \"music is all we got!\"\nZL: Freestyling\nCTR: Yea, like just off the top. \"Bom bom BOMBOM.\" But this whole sound is like my favourite thing. Because it resembles the choir sound that I've been trying to get but it also makes it kinda futurist at the same time. You know? And, that's I think one of the encompassing ideas of the whole project cause that sound is on, Francis is credited on \"Summer Friends\" but he also did all of the Kanye vocals on it, he also does the end of \"Same Drugs\" there's a whole part that he does and even though it's not him playing on \"How Great\" my cousin Nicole came in and sang this lead vocal from \"How Great Is Our God\" and my homie Peter came in and did Francis' prismiser effect with his same harmoniser and preset that we learned from him and shit, and really makes it sound like a whole new thing\nZL: It's like new church hall almost, it sort brings a whole like you said modernises something which has been around for as long as\nCTR: Exactly. I mean that's the whole process of this thing is like putting God back in, you know, God back in our hands\nZL: Let's talk about this real quick because what's interesting to me is when you think about artists, when you think about musicians in general, religion has always played a very strong part in peoples' lives. There's no mystery that faith in music and faith in God go hand-in-hand a lot of times. I can think of a lot of artists who are very religious but they guard it, they guard it privately for themselves probably cause they feel it should be a personal experience. And I'm sure that's the case in rap too, I'm positive of it. You know, you are, the devotion is on display on this record. That's really unique if you think about it, you're not hiding anything, it's very very open, you really are serving a purpose here.\nCTR: Yea, I mean since I, I think, I mean all of this music that came from me moving to Los Angeles was a catalyst, I moved out here at the beginning of 2014 and stayed here only for about four of five months but in that time, I felt like I was kind of losing my God a little bit you know. And that separation got, I kind of got rid of the feeling by filling every morning, literally filling my whole neighbourhood with this Kirk Franklin sound we had the craziest speaker system, we used to have this giant house in L.A. called, uh, we would call it Coy Castle. It's this big dumb ass mansion that I should've never rented, we had the craziest speaker system in there and every morning starting at 6 am I'd wake up cause I'd be on Chicago time and we'd crank Kirk Franklin through the fucking whole neighbourhood and that I think, and from that, you know, that was the time I started making a lot of this music two years ago and it kind of carried through and led me to understand, to know that my next project was going to be founded in God and founded in my faith. But I never really set out to make anything that could pretend to be New Gospel or pretend to be The Gospel. It's just I think music from me as a Christian man. I think before I was making music as a Christian child and like, and in both cases I have imperfections but I think there was a declaration that could be made out of going through all of the shit that I went through in the past two years.\nZL: Having been a Christian child and having been a Christian young man, what do you think, and this could be taken as a question, I'm interested in your perspective even if it's just a short one. What do you think God means to kids these days from your experience?\nCTR: That's a really good question. I still think that God means everything to everyone whether they understand it or not or can really see for themselves where they find God, you know. But I don't necessarily, I know for a fact that, you know, we're not pushed or promoted to speak about God with fervor. I don't think that there's anything that really allows us to do it. But I think the new generation in the forward is all about freedom and all about the ability to do what we want and, you know, we're not free unless we can talk about God.\nZL: No you're all in, you're all in. You're all in.\nCTR: Like let's go!\nZL: And the thing is when Kanye came out and said that Pablo is more of a gospel record then it is anything else and I think he's, that assessment was correct in that there are definitely gospel feelings to that record. You know did you guys discuss it when you were talking about the importance of bringing back the community in that sense or at least audio-wise and sonically the community, did you talk of that together?\nCTR: Yea. Well I think me and Kanye both in the experience of working on The Life of Pablo both were able to grow and take things from it. And when I first came in, like I was two years ago, I was blasting Kirk Franklin. You know what I'm saying, I was blasting Fred Hammond, I was blasting Byron Cage and in that space Kanye was working on his album but he was also allowing me to play my album in front of all these people. And we had conversations about faith and had conversations about God. And I think when Kanye said that he was making a gospel album he did not mean gospel the genre at all. He's talking about literally the gospel in terms of telling a story. And repeating a historic happening and documenting it. And I think a lot of people kind of got lost in the fact that he had said it was a gospel album and I also rapped a whole bunch of historically Christian bars on that, right. But I think that the making of my album and the making of his album were very separate but connected in that we had a lot of good conversations together you know.\nZL: You seemed very connected on that record. I mean would you, I mean it feels good to me. Would you guys work on something together in that ilk? Have you talked about working together on something that's even more gospel related and bringing that faith together on record?\nCTR: I think that the main thing that we wanna connect on is this project called Good Ass Job. Like that's a thing that we talked about a long time ago and I think everything that we've been working on together has been sort of a piece of it, whether we were together in the room or not I think my intro for Acid Rap was called \"Good Ass Intro\" and there's a sample from his Get Well Soon mixtape and in a lot of ways \"All We Got\" is the same thing. It wasn't necessarily that we sat down and wrote together in a room or that we bounced ideas in a traditional way. I literally like sampled Ye. I literally took what he gave me in a session of freestyles and and sat with it and worked with it and worked with it and he had given me all the pieces that I needed to make what I wanted to make. And so, I think moreso than like making a traditional project or making a traditional faith-filled project or anything like I think he just wanted to help me make the dopest shit that I could make.\nPart 3. 20:48 - 30:57\nCTR: You wanna hear this original version of \"Waves\" I made for Ye?\nZL: Yea!\nChance plays original version of \"Waves\"\nCTR: I had this big choir and this crazy arrangement for it, he took out all the choirs. He kept my verses but changed everything else.\nZL: That's crazy! That's crazy! Woooo! That's crazy\nCTR: Ain't that funny?\nZL: So he came in and went \"no, no, no\"\nCTR: \"No no no no, yes.\" That was it. It was like \"no no no no no. yes.\" Actually I also have a very funny verse from the \"Nina Chop\" song\nChance plays original version of \"Famous/Nina Chop\"\nZL: By the way, Swizz, this beat\u2014unreal\nCTR: Oh yea he went crazy! It was so funny cause I hated this beat when I first got it from him and then I was like, and then when we flipped it and I heard the final version I was like \"he was right this is way hotter than what we were doing\"\nChance plays his original verse from \"Nina Chop\"\nZL: I feel like you and Ye is like too good (Chance laughs) it's like it has to be some truth that's told here. Cause it's great that there's a collaborative nature to your relationship but\nCTR: It's unfair isn't it?\nZL: Let's talk about the way that you released this record and the way that you've released records in the past. Much has been made of this independent streak and I think because even though we're moving into a new world some of the old traditions have come with us. When did you as an artist, or in fact even just as individuals realise that \"free for everybody\" was the path that you wanted to take, that this was the point of difference for you?\nCTR: That's a good question Zane, haha. Well I think that the \"free\" part of it is more of an attention-grabbing thing and something that people can use as a marker to kinda track what I'm doing. Right? I mean since day one, since I was you know, fifteen, sixteen passing out mixtapes outside of my highschool I always gave them away for free and I'd get in trouble with my pops cause he'd work to get this money and then I'd spend it to make these and literally give it away. I would always explain though that I wanted to get it to as many people as possible. I think after 10 Day when I decided to make Acid Rap a mixtape and really like a really free mixtape, and really went away from a lot of the deals I was being offered it was kind of to throw out a beacon and let everybody see what could come of a free artist. And I wanted people to associate those words and to see, you know, an independent artists independence\nZL: Truly independent\nCTR: And just so you know it's, I don't, it was never, you know, I wanted to look like, I was very special doing these things or like I'm the only one that could do these things really. It's all about demonstrating the abilities of a person with, you know, a good team around them and an idea of where they want to go.\nZL: You're still on the outside looking in and having success on your own terms, what does it look like to you because you're one of the only people that really is, from your standpoint.\nCTR: Yea. I mean, sometimes it looks like a sweatshop. And, and I hate a lot of parts of it. But one of the things, if I can shoutout Kanye one more time that he helped me with, was the understanding that you can't look at these companies as entities. You know? These are all individual people making decisions and when people make wrong decisions you put a pressure to get that person pushed out but you don't completely down a company or an organisation. So, with that being said I don't agree with the way that labels are set up. I don't agree that anybody should sign 360 deals or sign away their publishing or do, or take most of the infrastructure that's included in a formal deal. But I've learned to not be like, you know, fuck this company and fuck this company, even though a lot of those people tried to make it really hard for me to release my project.\nZL: How do they do that? How do they make it hard, when you're independent, take your business to the point where if one more label tries to stop me. That it becomes a hook.\nCTR: Well here's the thing, most people are signed, right? So, say, say you make a project and there's twelve Universal artists on it. And then not only do they find out after the fact that you've recorded with these artists and that you plan on making videos with these artists, but they find out also on top of it that you plan to release it for free. So that's when you get phone calls where people are trying to tell you that they own your friends, or that you can't make any decisions without them being a part of it. And you, you know. I only use Universal as an example because those are my people and they helped me get the project done. But, you know, for the people that aren't named, you know, there is that kind of interference that happens when you're trying to push something out that people feel like they own. You know? Or trying to give something away that people feel\nZL: Yea it's a lot of investors coming in after the fact\nCTR: It's a lot of suits and ties of people that don't know how the fuck to play notes telling you the value of what you're making or whatever you're doing.\nZL: Have you ever been tempted and I only raise it because there have been little hints along the way I mean even on the new record there's a couple of moments where you talk about you know \"Kanye's best prodigy, he never signed me\" and I wondered if that was ever on the table. And I think it's \"Angels\" where you say \"Fuck it, maybe I should sign to OVO\" was that that record where you said that?\nCTR: Yea that is, that's, yea I mean I've had, everybody has had that conversation. We've had all the conversations. And what's funny is that some of those conversations still keep coming back. But with Kanye, it was cool because he did offer me a deal but still worked with me diligently, you know, after knowing that that wasn't what I wanted to do. And I used the word \"prodigy\" because I can't really, I wouldn't go as far to call myself Kanye's prot\u00e9g\u00e9 because I didn't have that experience that some of my best friends got working right underneath him. I think that the word \"prodigy\" is cool cause like, I was just a kid that he knows, that, and I am still a kid and am still growing and don't you know, fully understand how everything works and my potential or what I'm going to do. But I'm, I had the insight of Ye being around me at the point where I've kind of already decided a path to be like \"Yo, you should sign. No you're not gonna sign? Cool, let's get this money.\"\nPart 4. 30:58 to 40:28\nZL: Yea. You could sell music independently, it's not like one goes without the other, there are a lot of independent artists who have sold their records and have sold them at a very competitive price in order to survive but also to not feel like you're causing anybody financial disservice as a fan. Why the decision not to sell this record still?\nCTR: I think in part, a big part of it is that we are at such a crucial time in terms of music, I mean before, I know it's being highly publicised now, this, this, you know, the what is it the National Recording Arts and Sciences, I don't know what they're called, but those guys had been having a conversation I think up to at least a year ago about changing some of the verbage in their rules and how they're inclusive of, um\nZL: Awards, charts, all that kind of stuff. And there's been changes in streaming on the charts as well\nCTR: Yea, so the charts are already changing, they're including streaming. I still don't necessarily agree with, how they, it's something like every 1,000 streams is a sale\nZL: Is like one purchase\nCTR: Or something? I don't know, I don't really care about that. But at least they're making that move and I think the Grammys started making the move I think about a year ago they started voting on it, I don't know cause I don't really, I'm not on Grammy board anymore, but they uh\nZL: But you were!\nCTR: Yea, back in the day! But they originally, or the wording is that they can't nominate a project unless it's released, unless it's a commercial release, right?\nZL: Right. And does it qualify now that you're on streaming?\nCTR: No. But that's the thing, because of this timing I think it was important to have these mixtapes be trilogised and be a thing that existed. Regardless of how the revolution goes, you know, I know that I was not on the bus when everything was changing. You know what I'm saying? And I was like \"fuck it, I'm still dropping mixtapes.\" Now whatever's next, I don't really know, I've kind of, am a little turned off from making music right this second cause I'm still sick and shit, and I just did a project. But like, you know, I know that I did the three projects exactly how I wanted to and that they were mixtapes and that's where I came from.\nZL: Trilogy's perfect. Does it feel like now that cap has signified the end of that particular era for you, in some respects?\nCTR: I think for sure. Like I mean I wouldn't necessarily say that I'm not making anymore mixtapes cause I, I like making mixtapes I might make a tape with Jay Electronica soon, I might make a tape with anybody, let me stop doing that.\nZL: I'm excited.\nCTR: That's cool, and it'll be awesome but I think for sure that mode of projects was its own thing.\nZL: Yea for sure.\nCTR: And I had to make certain statements because I was in the climate that I was in but will, like we were just saying, when 10 Day came out they didn't count streams. And\nZL: Thing's changed so much even since then.\nCTR: Yea and I think everything will continue to change but I think we do have to think about being inclusive in terms of artists that don't necessarily have a label attached to them or want to release music commercially cause that doesn't have anything to do with artistic excellence, which is what they celebrate you know and because it's you know where this is the shit moving forward, you know it's gotta move forward but let shit change, you know what I'm saying?\nZL: Let's talk about Jay Electronica for a second\nCTR: Yea, let's do that for a minute.\nZL: For a few minutes!\nCTR: For a few minutes!\nZL: We talk about about Jay Elec. I mean, a guy who's sorta opens the door, comes into the room for a hot second lays waste and then disappears again. So to have him on a song as powerful as \"How Great\" is it still your favourite song on your work, it's really unbelievable man, you know real emotional, powerful piece of music. What I really love about that as well is just talking from a total rap nerd's point of view for a second is that you almost chameleon-like adopt his flow for a minute in the beginning\nCTR: Oh yea completely\nZL: Deliberately, you know to create a synergy. I love that. I was listening to it and was like \"is that Jay Elec?\" at first and you were like \"da, ba-da, ba-da, ba-da\" that sort of like tripping flow that he does.\nCTR: What is it? I'm trying to remember like, oh \"Candyman, Candyman, spit me a dream.\" What is it? \"Blow a chunk of the levee out and spit me a stream.\" Yea so that's, yea, but no I'm probably - I mean, somebody could fight me for it - but I feel like I'm Jay Electronica's biggest fan.\nZL: Haha now we're all in that line!\nCTR: But it's, I've always been, you know what I'm saying very, for as long as I can remember like back to high school, I was \"Jay Elec, very tough.\" And he's a very well-read, well-educated dude and-\nZL: When he speaks it's totally believable. Cause he's at that point in his life where, what he's talking about he's lived. That's unique.\nCTR: Definitely. I mean, there's a line in his verse on the project where he says, he says, \"Jay Elec would've never made it, O' son of man, O' son of man. Who is the angel that stood on Earth with a foot on water and a foot on land? Who is the angel that rode a Harley from the projects to the parliament?\" And then that line I'm like \"who is that angel?\" cause you know he's dropping mad, spiritual text references, these are joints that you really have to look up, you might need somebody you has a degree in that shit to really know what the fuck he's talking about. The last line about riding a Harley to the house of parliament, I mean that's not a reference that's his life he's talking about himself like that shit really happened. And I don't know when that happened or what that means but like that's Jay Electronica talking about some really, crazy spiritual shit that he's taking over and shit.\nZL: He's really one of the greats and I think in many respects as frustrating as it is for us while we sit around and wait around for more music it just adds to that, you know\nCTR: Well I think this was The Prestige, if anybody knows what I'm talking about I think, or at least the beginning of the third Act, like he's in that space of like, you know, he had a song that I used to love where he has the sample, it's like Elijah Muhammad where he talks about, like a king has to, has to leave the people and go away and wait til he can come back and manifest, it's written, his time.\nZL: Let's talk about \"Juke Jam\" on the record, which is, which is one of those songs which, I've been reading a lot of press and reflections about the record and that one's bubbling up as people continue to analyse the album and pick their favourites, cause are going so deep on this on the thinking process or thought process. And \"Juke Jam\" is one of those songs that people are feeling.\nCTR: Yea, and I love that. Isn't that weird though? Cause it's, well I guess it's, well that record is like very, very Chicago and like almost, you know, excluding, you know I was kind of worried that people wouldn't really connect to the record cause it's, you know, about a specific place that I think even certain Chicagoans don't know about I'm actually sure of certain Chicagoans don't know about.\nZL: Can you tell us more about it?\nCTR: Yea, I mean when I was a shorty we used to go to this spot down the street from Avalon Park called The Rink and it was a roller rink but really it was a... Have you ever seen ATL? Probably not.\nZL: No.\nCTR: So there's like a movie called ATL and they go to Cascade and it's like, it's the same thing in that movie it's just like a place where like I did actually get into my first fight and got my first juke and, like, I, there's obviously a giant roller rink on the floor but it's about what's happening out by the lockers. That's like, that's like the world that we was in.\nZL: I think it's cool that you've involved Justin Bieber in that song because you two have a friendship that goes back and there was a key moment, I remember, reading about when you know you guys were on the same stage at Coachella and that was like a defining moment for both of you because what it did was it opened up the parameters of what was actually the perception of the two of you. It was like \"why is Chance fucking with Justin Bieber?\" and then \"why is Justin Bieber on stage with Chance?\" and like how does it work? And like, it was kind of cool.\nCTR: Yea that's my fucking boy, like he's the shit and he's just very dope at everything that he does, at writing, at singing, he's an amazing vocalist.\nZL: How did you guys even meet? Like how did that happen?\nCTR: How did me and Justin meet... Me and Justin met actually after we made \"Confident\" so I won't say that me and Justin were friends when we made \"Confident\" but I was a fan.\nZL: Of course you were, you wouldn't have jumped on if it wasn't.\nCTR: Exactly. And we met at Coachella and hung out all day that day before I went on stage and it wasn't til, like right before I went on stage that he was like\nZL: That was the day you met?\nCTR: That was the day I met him, we sat backstage and sm- and chilled\nZL: Hahahaha\nCTR: And, just chilled, and, then right before I went on stage he was like \"you want me to come out for a song?\" and I was like \"yea let's have a dance battle.\" And we did\nZL: That's crazy\nCTR: And he crushed me. But only cause I was so tired, I'd been performing the whole day\nZL: Real tired, like tired!\nCTR: I'm cold, in real life! I probably just yelled on this microphone and shit\nZL: It's a cool record, I really dig it, I really like it. But you know what I also like is the fact that getting away from the famos for a second, and talking about, I wanna talk about some of the new people on the record too and you know the fact that you're always looking out for people that are gonna bring a different shade to what you do, a different vibe to what you do. You know Knox being a classic example.\nPart 5. 40:29 to 50:01\nCTR: Yea, so I mean, Knox Fortune is one of my favourite producers, he's like been in the background and produced on a lot of records that I worked on and a lot of records for my friends, and we you know, have a bunch of collaborations that didn't really see the light you know. But that one, that record  was so dope because I had it for like a week before he touched it, and it was just me talking on the record saying \"All night, I been drinkin' all night, I been drinkin' all night.\" And he was like \"yo let me touch that\" and brought it back and it was, you know, I mean he's, he's Chicago, so\nZL: What is it about Chicago man? Like, I mean it's definitely one of the creative capitals in the world for music, you know you could put it right next to sort of a Manchester or a Liverpool, now of course people talk about Toronto having its moment, but you know there are places, Berlin, there are places where music lives. Why Chicago, why is it, having grown up in it?\nCTR: I think, I mean one it's like just a very cultured place, like you know we have, you know Chicago's a big city but it's in the middle of Illinois. You know what I'm saying? And like, all of the suburban areas around us like kind of like create this wall of like, you know, inclusive sound and shit, and I think on top of that obviously it's just we've never had a music industry and I think because there was no industry or big labels posted there it gave everybody a lot of air to like make what the fuck they wanted to make. And bred a lot of you know, just awesome talent across all genres.\nZL: There's one really funny lyric in there that made me smile on that song where you were like, \"you just wanna talk politics and Chicago shit\"\nCTR: Yea yea\nZL: And that was just funny to me because it's like, ok you just released this records that's like totally dedicated to Chicago, all anyone's gonna wanna talk about is Chicago and now, you've opened the flood gates, this is it, this is your time, Chicago's the new favourite, here you go and already it's like you're already over it! Hahaha\nCTR: Yea! Well, like that song, to me, is the best song that I've ever written because it's such an awesome concept. The idea behind it is that I'm at this party and there's women all over me and, you know, there's professionals in suits all over me, and, haha, people that are telling me they're my cousin and shit, and in my mind all everybody wants from me is a ride home. And I think that's just such a funny, stupid, concept, but to build off of it and to kind of make it connect in a way that, you know, \"Now, oh now you wanna chill, now you wanna build\" you know what I'm saying? \"Now you got the bill.\" It's, it's\nZL: Gas money, cash money\nCTR: Exactly. All of that shit is a fun concept I think because I do get fucked up at parties and get paranoid and I think it's just really funny to bring it back to just everybody wanting a ride... \"Oh you my cousin? No you wasn't\" hahahaha\nZL: You made a record that is really a love letter for Chicago, it's a positive, uplifting, listen for a city that's been well documented either by the conventional media, front-face media which I call like the real kind of, how would I call it, like a modern media like Vice have gone out there and done a piece on it, you've got movies that have been made about it I mean, there's a story about it being told right now. You've done it in a way that's uplifting, which kind of contradicts everyone else's take on it. And I wondered what the challenges were in creating such an uplifting, positive-sounding record during such a tumultuous time.\nCTR: Yea. Well I mean there's definitely a challenge to it because it goes against public perception but it's not a stretch. I mean, Chicago's beautiful, people there are beautiful, events happening all the time, like beautiful music being made and, you know, there are like very dark shadowy parts of it and I think rather than, you know, Vice documentary-style pointing at shit and being like isn't this weird, it's kind of like being, you know, just shedding light in all of those areas. Like, you know, we talk a lot about 79th on the record because I want people to walk down 79th and sing \"79th\" in a way that doesn't necessarily go with whatever Spike Lee made in Chiraq you know what I'm saying? And it's not a lie, you know what I'm saying, it's not like, you know, this this terrible, dystopic, place. I'm from there, you know what I'm saying, and I'm like the happiest, again, like I'm happy.\nZL: What was it like growing up there?\nCTR: I mean, it's kind of hard because it was all I knew for so long, I didn't start travelling til I was like nineteen or twenty but like, it's super communal. Super small. Everybody's a person away from knowing someone. Everybody's cousin is somebody else's cousin. My mom graduated from Kenwood and I know like everybody in Hyde Park because of it. My dad graduated from  by my house because of it, was the block club president. So like I'm very intertwined in this city in terms of like, knowing people and knowing areas and shit.\nZL: Is there a movie to be made, I know like you were very vocal about you didn't like the way Chiraq presented the city, but is there a movie to be made and is it something you could see yourself being involved in, or in fact are involved in for all we know?\nCTR: I mean, I'm not, hmm. That's a good question. I think that the media that I make now is dope for Chicago and I think there are amazing filmmakers in Chicago that could make some type of think-piece. I'm not, I wasn't critical of Chiraq for the simple fact that I thought I could make a better movie. I just didn't think that that was any type of representation of the city it felt like it was written about somewhere else, some fantastical place and then they just put it in my city. But, I think, my main goal right now is you now making music and I've kind of been getting into theatre a little bit like you know, I want to write some type of think-piece for the theatre but\nZL: Would you do that on script-level as well as musical? On multiple levels?\nCTR: Yea, I mean like I really like screenwriting like that's not something that I'm foreign to at all.\nZL: And how many would you say that you've tried or attempted to write?\nCTR: Two\nZL: So you've finished two?\nCTR: Yea, there's one that's about a Hallowe'en party and then there's one that's like an existential, like I don't know it's like an up in the air thing where there's like this guy... I don't wanna talk about that one, I don' t know that I'm actually making that one but the first one\nZL: Halloween party stupid, so we can call that by name\nCTR: We'll call it The Stupid Halloween Party\nZL That's so fire, that's the shit, what an awesome name!\nCTR: Haha no if I would've named it that\nZL: Back on the table, cause of the name\nCTR: Let's go!\nZL: So as we sort of go through, this has been fun by the way\nCTR: This has been awesome. I'm chillin, I keep forgetting we're in an interview\nZL: I want to talk about family, because we're both family men. I've got kids, you have a newborn, how old now?\nCTR: She just turned 8 months on Monday\nZL: Congratulations\nCTR: Yea\nZL: So this is, you've documented this on the record which is again now, a lovely tone on the album, the honesty, and just the vulnerability and the heartfelt nature of it. And I read somewhere actually in an article that the cover artwork is a painting of you looking at your daughter as well. So, how has that experience been for you becoming a father?\nCTR: I mean, it's the greatest happening of my life and, you know, feels a lot like the beginning of my life\nZL: Right? It's hard to think about what you did before! I have no idea\nCTR: Yea it's crazy, tripping. But I mean it definitely comes with all, you know, a lot of hardships and shit you know and I think it's well documented on the album. One of my favourite records is a song I made with Future on it called \"Smoke Break\" and I think Future was perfect for it cause he's a father too and that record, I remember I started making it and my girlfriend came in and she didn't like it at first, now it's her favourite song. But the song talks about, you know, it's another song that uses drugs as a metaphor for relationships or sex or whatever but you know, there really is a whole turning point in terms of your priorities and your schedule and we really did lose for a second, you know, the respect of time for ourselves and the respect of time to just take a break, put the baby down for a second and like, enjoy each other's company.\nZL: Having been in and around, somewhat of a political environment, albeit local body politics, in that situation and your dad working with Barack Obama when he was a senator and being exposed to that and I think that it makes sense now listening to your music and the way that you talk about Chicago from the point of view of Chicago as it comes from a community-driven place. What does it mean to you, or what do you think it means to a generation right now because I mean in essence I think a lot of artists are saying things that people probably look to politicians and policy makers to say. You know, and then in some respects those things aren't really that forthcoming from a lot of political circles, it seems to be in particular chaos right now internationally, politically.\nPart 6. 50:02 to 60:53\nCTR: Yea, I think there was always... you know, I think the word \"politics\" you know, sounds dirty to me, when I even think about it. But I never really saw my dad as working in politics, like whenever he, whenever I went to his job or he talked about what he was working on, I always saw, you know, that same idea of being a good man and working on projects that will help people. So when my dad took any job it was always kind of a state director position, or a head of community outreach, it was always about building a bigger communal space, networking with all the, all the, the heads of religious organisations, of community initiatives, being in contact with and always on with people that are trying to make a difference and being, spearheading, really, a lot of initiatives.\nZL: You must be proud man, do you know what he thinks about the record you just made and the music you play?\nCTR: I hope so, I'm proud of my dad like that's what, that's what's so funny is he says he's proud of me all the time and that's like, that's a dope thing coming from somebody that moves shit in the physical you know what I'm saying. Versus like, I mean I do try and do physical shit but like I, my shit is like a lot more\nZL: Well you have to get physical now, we have to talk about the road bro. Because the album is done. And it's been a minute, do you think about it? Are you in plans?\nCTR: Definitely. So I mean like, touring the music is going to be so easy just in terms of like the sound and pure audio of it and the sequencing of the show.\nZL: It will be you and The Experiment?\nCTR: Yea. It's always gonna be me and The Experiment. That just works. You can't, you can't say, if it ain't broke. Do you know what I'm saying.\nZL: Is it gonna be The Experiment and extended family?\nCTR: Probably. Yea. The last two shows I got to play with Francis And The Lights. People won't know that unless you were at those two shows but like, you know. And I know Francis is about to drop his album so I probably shouldn't even say that cause he probably won't be with me but still, you know.\nZL: Put it out there.\nCTR: You know like I've always wanted to bring a bigger theatre feeling to Chicago. And when I say theatre I mean specifically like a Broadway sense like New York's theatre scene strives, thrives because they have Broadway and they have like a row of theatres and a very uplifted theatre scene. And I think\nZL: Is this something that will permeate through your terrain do you think?\nCTR: I think it's on the other end of it just because it's a stagnant thing. I want to build a building that people come in to like see, you know like an attraction? Like the world's biggest  that's on the road somewhere and people drive to go see that.\nZL: How hard are you gonna tour this record, fans are gonna want to know. I mean you've been to Europe, you've been around America, you haven't been to Australasia, you haven't been to probably Asia?\nCTR: So we'll be in Asia, Australia, New Zealand - can I say New Zealand and Australia or is that the same thing?\nZL: No they're not the same thing\nCTR: I knew they're not the same thing, I just wanted to check with you Zane\nZL: Yep! We categorically confirm we are not the same thing! But we're friends!\nCTR: And so, so New Zealand as well as Australia. Definitely gotta go back to Europe. And I think a very important thing that we're trying to work out right now is being in Africa outside of being in South Africa.\nZL: Amazing.\nCTR: And then maybe we'll do something in America too. Possibly.\nZL: I hope so! You imagine making this record...\nCTR: Wouldn't that be sick though?\nZL: ... just to not...\nCTR: Make everyone else travel for it? That's the new thing is, you gotta travel for music. That's why festivals are dope cause people go out of their way to go see a festival, but that's the same shit I was just talking about.\nZL: When's the touring gonna start? Do you know?\nCTR: I do know. I guess when this comes out the tickets will probably already drop so September.\nZL: I got a couple quick fire things to get through before we get up and out of here then let's get some fresh air. So number one, you mentioned something the other day when you were doing your Reddit questionnaire you mentioned about the Childish Gambino mixtape, is that ever gonna see the light of day?\nCTR: Yea, I know for a fact that it's gonna come out by fall, I think\nZL: He's all nervous now I put him on the spot\nCTR: The thing is, I don't wanna say too much, Donald is like my older brother and like, I can say some shit that will get me in trouble. He's working on his TV show so I should say that first. And Atlanta's amazing, he's out there right now finishing up the TV show and the tape is not done, or close to being done. But it will come out.\nZL: You've got some skin in the game.\nCTR: Yep.\nZL: \"No Problem,\" we have to talk about \"No Problem\" because it is without a doubt one of the best songs of the year within the framework of the album.\nCTR: Thank you.\nZL: I think I played it for like thirty minutes straight when we played it on Beats.\nCTR: You did. And thank you for that.\nZL: Thank you.\nCTR: I got a lot of tweets about it they said they liked that.\nZL: No the song's incredible obviously brining 2 Chainz and Lil Wayne into it and creating such a really great chemistry on that record. It isn't always easy when you've got you know guest bars coming in, sometimes it can feel as though it's been sent in my tape or whatever, or digitally. Tell us about that song, tell as what that song means to you and, people have never heard you talk about it.\nCTR: Yea I mean that song is everything that it's supposed to sound like, it's supposed to sound like the smash record that came from \"the other,\" you know what I'm saying? It's supposed to feel like what this year is supposed to feel like when we take a chance on \"the other\" and fuck with, you know what I'm saying, some dope shit that came organically. And it is banging on the doors of all of those labels and letting them know, like, literally and figuratively, like don't tweak. Stop trying to stop what I'm doing, you know, I'm over here, you're over there, do your thing. But like in both ways don't keep doing it.\nZL: But, I'm gonna say it over the biggest hit record of my career to date\nCTR: Yea, well I mean that's the way that you say some shit, I mean I can't say it quietly in an email or like it's, I think that it meant the most to me to have, you know, to have Wayne come on there and speak what he spoke\nZL: Great, great verse too\nCTR: Yea, I mean it still fucking scares me to this day to see that I have two records now with Lil Wayne. But, you know what I'm saying, I think to have him come in it and have him backing it up, cause there is a Chicago version of that record that will come out at some point and it does have, you know what I'm saying, the people I wanted to have on the record, but this version made sense for the album\nZL: Chicago people?\nCTR: Yea, I don't need to say who it is, it'll come out. But it's huge. It's having them do it, I think people that are juggernauts in the game stand next to me and also say like don't tweak on him. You know what I'm saying? I think it was poignant and it made its way to everyones' ears that it was supposed to.\nZL: Who's Big Fella?\nCTR: Oh, so you don't know who Ha Ha Davis is? Of course you don't know who Ha Ha Davis is. Ha Ha Davis is the fucking funniest of all time. And he's from Detroit and you know what I'm saying he's just like a comedian, a new age comedian so he's on Instagram, is where we all watch him from. But I've been a fan, everybody in Chicago says \"big fella\" cause its some Midwest shit at this point, it's some South shit now too like everyone says \"big fella.\" But I was a fan and I hit him up, I think a week before we went to Atlanta, or actually like two days before we went to Atlanta to shoot the \"No Problem\" video. And I was like \"yo, will you come with me just rock with me\" and we went out and just hung out together and met people together and now he's one of my closest friends. After he was in the video, I was like \"yo, will you narrate this whole project?\" So he was on four out of like fifteen of the, well he was on \"Grown Ass Kid,\" his main monologue is on \"Grown Ass Kid\" which, the labels, they stopped me. It didn't make it on the project.\nZL: Can you just get it out anyway? Just find a home for it?\nCTR: I actually found out recently that the record leaked and it's online but its official release is gonna be on Cam O'bi's project who's one of my favourite producers and did, he did \"Good Ass Outro,\" the outro from Acid Rap and \"Blessings\" on this new project, like the reprise. And he did three records on this project that all got stopped.\nZL: So much stopping\nCTR: Yea\nZL: No more stopping.\nCTR: Yea, don't try anything anymore.\nZL: No more.\nCTR: Can I show you this Big Sean song that was supposed to be on the project that got stopped? You probably couldn't play it on the broadcast cause it wasn't a cleared single.\nBroadcast paused while Chance plays song privately\nZL: It's interesting cause like, to me it's dope as hell like I love that but it's funny now listening to Coloring Book\nCTR: You feel it wouldn't have fit?\nZL: It feels like\nCTR: Everything happens for a reason.\nZL: Crazy right? Still man, hearing you and Sean together.\nCTR: It would've been perfect. It's funny cause Sean, Jeremih and Cole all tour together and those are like my three best friends in music. And we had three songs altogether that were all collaborative songs and they all got stopped. Luckily, Jeremih still ended up on \"Summer Friends\" but Jeremih was on like three or four songs on Coloring Book.\nZL: Man, the more you tell it the more I realise like we're lucky we got anything at all.\nCTR: Yea\nZL: Out of the guests at least, it'll sure\nCTR: It'll never happen like that again though. All it takes is, is, I think the growth of the artists, plural, and the retraction of the control, and then... I don't think, I don't think there will ever be a release again from me that feels controlled.\nZL: You don't want zero problems.\nCTR: They definitely don't want a single one.\nZL: Hahaha. Love you man.\nCTR: Thank you\nZL: Thank you\nCTR: Naw, this was awesome.", "image": "https://images.genius.com/9bab4b47984b047f2f2eeeb2eecd50a0.596x597x1.png", "artist": "Chance The Rapper", "raw": {"annotation_count": 20, "api_path": "/songs/2478896", "description": {"dom": {"tag": "root", "children": [{"tag": "p", "children": ["Apple Music Beats 1 radio host ", {"tag": "a", "attributes": {"href": "https://genius.com/artists/Zane-lowe"}, "data": {"api_path": "/artists/73120"}, "children": ["Zane Lowe"]}, " sat down with ", {"tag": "a", "attributes": {"href": "https://genius.com/artists/Chance-the-rapper"}, "data": {"api_path": "/artists/16751"}, "children": ["Chance The Rapper"]}, " for his first interview since the release of ", {"tag": "em", "children": [{"tag": "a", "attributes": {"href": "https://genius.com/albums/Chance-the-rapper/Coloring-book"}, "data": {"api_path": "/albums/150853"}, "children": ["Coloring Book"]}, ","]}, " Chance\u2019s third solo project."]}, "", {"tag": "p", "children": ["Chance\u2019s interview \u2013 ", {"tag": "a", "attributes": {"href": "https://twitter.com/zanelowe/status/735141382487052288", "rel": "nofollow"}, "children": ["one of Zane\u2019s favorite conversations ever"]}, " \u2013 aired on Beats 1 radio on May 24th 2016.

You've been here before.\nChance The Rapper: Yea this is where we did a lot of the Surf album and a lot of songs for Coloring Book.\nZL: That's right, Pharrell does some recording here as well as Beats 1 and this is a place with rich history and so we're here today to talk about music and it's the first time we've had a chance to properly sit down and meet and hang out. It feels good to finally meet you and especially now that you've dropped this amazing record and the reviews are coming in left, right and centre and I don't know if you pay much attention to those things, if anyone's even given you a headline I mean they're universally acclaimed.\nCTR: That's dope, I mean I haven't read 'em all but I did see a bunch of them that were really nice and broke it down in a cool way.\nZL: You seem really well, very healthy obviously there was some concern and you had to come out and say look I've been under the weather, you were hospitalised at one point, I think you said it was pneumonia, like what was that about?\nCTR: I don't know, I just get really sick I think I need to like, just take better care of myself, I just, I try and push it as far as I can\nZL: I wondered if it was a creative consumption, the stress\nCTR: Yea you know that and also I get tonsillitis a lot, I don't know I just get sick very easily, I'm just like Mr. Glass, I don't know. I was sick and I'm getting better.\nZL: What's the pressure like when it came to finishing the record, like how close did it come to the moment when it was finally released on that Thursday evening American time and when did you actually hand it in?\nCTR: We were to the limit, like we were able to still turn in the album to our friends over at Apple on time, or a little bit behind time actually cause\nZL: Well what is time actually these days anyways?\nCTR: I know! It's a new idea to me also I think just turning in music for somebody to try and post it in a certain time and space. I've worked with end dates before like I had announced Acid Rap but we were in the studio until we posted it.\nZL: And it was self-imposed\nCTR: Yea, so it was kinda the same thing with Coloring Book it was just a little more stressful because of, I think the environment that we created in that studio because there were so many different people working on it and everybody was sleeping at the studio, we had all the inflatable beds there. It was like twenty people all living out of the studio space, along with me and my girlfriend and my daughter and I think that, there was a lot of, you know, just fatigue and tension and you know, I think adrenaline of all of it like boiling down, minute by minute and, like the last time that we played it before we turned it in we were like it's perfect, it's cool.\nZL: Hahaha I just think lyrically like the way you opened up Acid Rap you talk about how rap's made you anxious and acid made you crazy. And then on this one you go straight in you're like talking about fatherhood and marriage and it's like wow, what a difference two or three years can make. Have you had enough perspective since you released Coloring Book to be able to realise the journey that you've been on? I know you threw it all into the album but now you've had a week or so to process that and you see how much life has changed.\nCTR: Yea, I think that's the scariest part is not having the album to focus on as much because all of the real world problems aren't there you know. So me, you know, not paying attention to my health for months on months on end, you know, it's like all in your face or you know what I'm saying, your relationships, or\nZL: You've got real life to deal with now!\nCTR: Yea! Real life is like\nZL: You had a great excuse before! You could go three days without answering a call now it's like, what's your excuse now Chance?\nCTR: Exactly.\nZL: Haha, let's talk now about the themes of the record a bit, and the one that really jumps out to me, you know, is the relationship between art, music, faith and devotion right and the way that you brought church and religion to the record and we're gonna talk about that. But I want, you know, first of all on this record one of the first major statements that you make you know is that music's all we got. Now, this is something that we've all thrown around in various conversations because, either be in a lighthearted way like \"music's all I know, it's all I'm passionate about\" but this has more urgency to it and I wonder you know what the deeper meaning was, to you with that lyric that you and Kanye share on that opening track.\nCTR: Well that, \"music is all we got\" is Kanye's lyric, right? So that record  is perfect because it wasn't the first record that we made for it but just like \"Good Ass Intro\" it ended up being kinda like the thesis of the project right. So, I had made a lot of records and I have a record called \"Finish Line\" that was gonna be the intro, and\nZL: That's crazy to think about that now\nCTR: Yea it's, that was a weird sequencing, I'm glad that's not how it ended up being, but that record is so much of the record because it talks about faith, it talks about, you know, there's other blessings in the world and on the album but, you know, at the end of the day music is what we have, you know what I'm saying, and you know we're blessed at all times but you know, waiting on your blessing or thinking that your blessing is in an album is not what it is, you know what I'm saying? It's, there is no higher miracle in this project or in any of the material things in the world, but the materials do exist. So the music is what we have, and I remember I flew out to L.A., this was only like two months ago and I met up with Donnie Trumpet and Nate Fox who made most of the music that I make and they, actually I wanna play it for you. So I had, I dunno how it's gonna sound in the interview but we had, they had a record that they were working on with\nZL: We're gonna record this anyway so we can put the real audio through\nCTR: Ok, perfect. So, I was working on, or they were working on this record with Grace Weber who I am in love with, both musically and otherwise she's the best, and she, they had written the song for her for her album and she, and they played it for me and it sounded like this at first\nChance plays demo version of \"All We Got\"\nCTR: Actually I haven't heard this in a long time! Right? Crazy! So the kicks were so different and it was so dancey\nZL: Yea, totally! It's way more uptempo and way more dancey\nCTR: And, I remember when it got to this part where it says \"woah, woah, woah, uh, uh, uh, uhhhh, uhhhh\" but I heard this and was like this is, this is it.\nZL: Just that moment\nCTR: After that I was like that's exactly what I need. So I was out here because Kanye had called me when I was in Chicago and said \"I wanna help you in whatever way I can\" and\nZL: This was, what was the timeline of\nCTR: This was two months ago\nZL: Whoa so your work on Pablo is done\nCTR: My work on Pablo is done and I'm working on my project now. I put a lot of time and effort into that album and learned a lot and gained a lot outta that and, but I think that there was a lot that Kanye had to do on his front, the same place that I am right now, where he was like ok, all my personal life and all the other things that I need to do\nZL: I need to let it go, I wanna get back in the process\nCTR: Exactly. So he hit me and he said \"I got you, I want you to come out for four days.\" And so like I said I got in, I went straight over to Nico's spot and they played me that record and I was like yo, I know this is for Grace, I need this. I need you guys to help make this work for me. And I asked them if it was ok if I brought it by Kanye. They said cool. So we all went over to Kanye's spot and within a few hours of sitting around and having all these deep conversations, cause that's what Kanye does is he, he does lectures and shit and they're all, they're all like very insightful and important and helped me out a lot and, but after about two hours of being there\nChance's phone rings\nCTR: Aw sorry, my baby mama's FaceTiming me, I'll take it later. Ok I will real quick\nZL: Go for it\nCTR: Let's see, aw my baby's in it too. Hey, I'm in this interview right now can I call you back babe? (Oh I'm sorry) It's ok love, bye. Um, now I can't remember cause she's gorgeous.\nZL: Exactly, exactly! Haha and therein lies the perspective of life, and therein lies, \"all of this is total bullshit\"\nCTR: At all times haha\nZL: So you're hanging out with Kanye, he's giving you the deepness\nCTR: I almost forgot, so he basically asked us to pull up the track, we pull it up, he starts doing his Kanye dance to it and he's like \"Ok, I fuck with it, take off all the drums.\" So I'm like \"Ok, I don't really know what, what that means but we'll take off the drums.\" So now it's just horns, synth and Ye says uh, \"pull out the MPC.\" So they bring out this MPC, almost like in like the gold suitcase, like from Pulp Fiction-\nZL: Ahhhh! Like Indiana Jones\nCTR: like with just the . And they put it on the table and he records drums in a way that I've never seen before he does everything live off the MPC. So, all of his patterns that you know he's-\nZL: So he's recording it like an organic drum kit, \nCTR: Exactly, but that makes, you know. As it plays now, the drums aren't like mixed separately it's like, all the kicks, all the hi-hats everything are at the same level and shit. But he does it literally in one take, so from top to bottom he goes, you know, he just stands there and just plays through it and plays all the drums that you hear on the track as they are now. And then less than 5 seconds after he does that one take through he goes through and freestyles over it.\nPart 2. 10:00 to 20:47\nCTR: There's this guy named Francis Starlite, who's\nZL: Francis And The Lights\nCTR: Francis And The Lights, my god\nZL: Who by the way, vocally on this record shines and adds a texture of emotion that is just out of control\nCTR: That's the one perpetual thing through the album that's just, is him and, I've heard a lot of sounds with harmoniser right, so one of my favourite things that I see on the internet is people commenting on the album as, you know, whenever they talk about this vocal sound that he's created they call it auto-tune. Or they say this sounds a lot like Bon Iver. Justin \nZL: And he can play any note\nCTR: Yea and he just builds a choir around it and it sounds like\nZL: Is that what happens at the end of \"All We Got\" as well so when it changes\nCTR: That's him. So let me play you this freestyle that I got cause this is still crazy to me to this day\nChance plays second demo of \"All We Got\"\nZL: How long have you known Francis for?\nCTR: So me and Francis met in, I wanna say 2013, maybe 2014, right after I dropped Acid Rap, I've always been a fran, a fan of Francis. These are those loud ass drums he put on here.\nZL: \nCTR: You know what I'm saying? This is just him, at the board, like this, like... So this vocal is solo right? And then... \"music is all we got!\"\nZL: Freestyling\nCTR: Yea, like just off the top. \"Bom bom BOMBOM.\" But this whole sound is like my favourite thing. Because it resembles the choir sound that I've been trying to get but it also makes it kinda futurist at the same time. You know? And, that's I think one of the encompassing ideas of the whole project cause that sound is on, Francis is credited on \"Summer Friends\" but he also did all of the Kanye vocals on it, he also does the end of \"Same Drugs\" there's a whole part that he does and even though it's not him playing on \"How Great\" my cousin Nicole came in and sang this lead vocal from \"How Great Is Our God\" and my homie Peter came in and did Francis' prismiser effect with his same harmoniser and preset that we learned from him and shit, and really makes it sound like a whole new thing\nZL: It's like new church hall almost, it sort brings a whole like you said modernises something which has been around for as long as\nCTR: Exactly. I mean that's the whole process of this thing is like putting God back in, you know, God back in our hands\nZL: Let's talk about this real quick because what's interesting to me is when you think about artists, when you think about musicians in general, religion has always played a very strong part in peoples' lives. There's no mystery that faith in music and faith in God go hand-in-hand a lot of times. I can think of a lot of artists who are very religious but they guard it, they guard it privately for themselves probably cause they feel it should be a personal experience. And I'm sure that's the case in rap too, I'm positive of it. You know, you are, the devotion is on display on this record. That's really unique if you think about it, you're not hiding anything, it's very very open, you really are serving a purpose here.\nCTR: Yea, I mean since I, I think, I mean all of this music that came from me moving to Los Angeles was a catalyst, I moved out here at the beginning of 2014 and stayed here only for about four of five months but in that time, I felt like I was kind of losing my God a little bit you know. And that separation got, I kind of got rid of the feeling by filling every morning, literally filling my whole neighbourhood with this Kirk Franklin sound we had the craziest speaker system, we used to have this giant house in L.A. called, uh, we would call it Coy Castle. It's this big dumb ass mansion that I should've never rented, we had the craziest speaker system in there and every morning starting at 6 am I'd wake up cause I'd be on Chicago time and we'd crank Kirk Franklin through the fucking whole neighbourhood and that I think, and from that, you know, that was the time I started making a lot of this music two years ago and it kind of carried through and led me to understand, to know that my next project was going to be founded in God and founded in my faith. But I never really set out to make anything that could pretend to be New Gospel or pretend to be The Gospel. It's just I think music from me as a Christian man. I think before I was making music as a Christian child and like, and in both cases I have imperfections but I think there was a declaration that could be made out of going through all of the shit that I went through in the past two years.\nZL: Having been a Christian child and having been a Christian young man, what do you think, and this could be taken as a question, I'm interested in your perspective even if it's just a short one. What do you think God means to kids these days from your experience?\nCTR: That's a really good question. I still think that God means everything to everyone whether they understand it or not or can really see for themselves where they find God, you know. But I don't necessarily, I know for a fact that, you know, we're not pushed or promoted to speak about God with fervor. I don't think that there's anything that really allows us to do it. But I think the new generation in the forward is all about freedom and all about the ability to do what we want and, you know, we're not free unless we can talk about God.\nZL: No you're all in, you're all in. You're all in.\nCTR: Like let's go!\nZL: And the thing is when Kanye came out and said that Pablo is more of a gospel record then it is anything else and I think he's, that assessment was correct in that there are definitely gospel feelings to that record. You know did you guys discuss it when you were talking about the importance of bringing back the community in that sense or at least audio-wise and sonically the community, did you talk of that together?\nCTR: Yea. Well I think me and Kanye both in the experience of working on The Life of Pablo both were able to grow and take things from it. And when I first came in, like I was two years ago, I was blasting Kirk Franklin. You know what I'm saying, I was blasting Fred Hammond, I was blasting Byron Cage and in that space Kanye was working on his album but he was also allowing me to play my album in front of all these people. And we had conversations about faith and had conversations about God. And I think when Kanye said that he was making a gospel album he did not mean gospel the genre at all. He's talking about literally the gospel in terms of telling a story. And repeating a historic happening and documenting it. And I think a lot of people kind of got lost in the fact that he had said it was a gospel album and I also rapped a whole bunch of historically Christian bars on that, right. But I think that the making of my album and the making of his album were very separate but connected in that we had a lot of good conversations together you know.\nZL: You seemed very connected on that record. I mean would you, I mean it feels good to me. Would you guys work on something together in that ilk? Have you talked about working together on something that's even more gospel related and bringing that faith together on record?\nCTR: I think that the main thing that we wanna connect on is this project called Good Ass Job. Like that's a thing that we talked about a long time ago and I think everything that we've been working on together has been sort of a piece of it, whether we were together in the room or not I think my intro for Acid Rap was called \"Good Ass Intro\" and there's a sample from his Get Well Soon mixtape and in a lot of ways \"All We Got\" is the same thing. It wasn't necessarily that we sat down and wrote together in a room or that we bounced ideas in a traditional way. I literally like sampled Ye. I literally took what he gave me in a session of freestyles and and sat with it and worked with it and worked with it and he had given me all the pieces that I needed to make what I wanted to make. And so, I think moreso than like making a traditional project or making a traditional faith-filled project or anything like I think he just wanted to help me make the dopest shit that I could make.\nPart 3. 20:48 - 30:57\nCTR: You wanna hear this original version of \"Waves\" I made for Ye?\nZL: Yea!\nChance plays original version of \"Waves\"\nCTR: I had this big choir and this crazy arrangement for it, he took out all the choirs. He kept my verses but changed everything else.\nZL: That's crazy! That's crazy! Woooo! That's crazy\nCTR: Ain't that funny?\nZL: So he came in and went \"no, no, no\"\nCTR: \"No no no no, yes.\" That was it. It was like \"no no no no no. yes.\" Actually I also have a very funny verse from the \"Nina Chop\" song\nChance plays original version of \"Famous/Nina Chop\"\nZL: By the way, Swizz, this beat\u2014unreal\nCTR: Oh yea he went crazy! It was so funny cause I hated this beat when I first got it from him and then I was like, and then when we flipped it and I heard the final version I was like \"he was right this is way hotter than what we were doing\"\nChance plays his original verse from \"Nina Chop\"\nZL: I feel like you and Ye is like too good (Chance laughs) it's like it has to be some truth that's told here. Cause it's great that there's a collaborative nature to your relationship but\nCTR: It's unfair isn't it?\nZL: Let's talk about the way that you released this record and the way that you've released records in the past. Much has been made of this independent streak and I think because even though we're moving into a new world some of the old traditions have come with us. When did you as an artist, or in fact even just as individuals realise that \"free for everybody\" was the path that you wanted to take, that this was the point of difference for you?\nCTR: That's a good question Zane, haha. Well I think that the \"free\" part of it is more of an attention-grabbing thing and something that people can use as a marker to kinda track what I'm doing. Right? I mean since day one, since I was you know, fifteen, sixteen passing out mixtapes outside of my highschool I always gave them away for free and I'd get in trouble with my pops cause he'd work to get this money and then I'd spend it to make these and literally give it away. I would always explain though that I wanted to get it to as many people as possible. I think after 10 Day when I decided to make Acid Rap a mixtape and really like a really free mixtape, and really went away from a lot of the deals I was being offered it was kind of to throw out a beacon and let everybody see what could come of a free artist. And I wanted people to associate those words and to see, you know, an independent artists independence\nZL: Truly independent\nCTR: And just so you know it's, I don't, it was never, you know, I wanted to look like, I was very special doing these things or like I'm the only one that could do these things really. It's all about demonstrating the abilities of a person with, you know, a good team around them and an idea of where they want to go.\nZL: You're still on the outside looking in and having success on your own terms, what does it look like to you because you're one of the only people that really is, from your standpoint.\nCTR: Yea. I mean, sometimes it looks like a sweatshop. And, and I hate a lot of parts of it. But one of the things, if I can shoutout Kanye one more time that he helped me with, was the understanding that you can't look at these companies as entities. You know? These are all individual people making decisions and when people make wrong decisions you put a pressure to get that person pushed out but you don't completely down a company or an organisation. So, with that being said I don't agree with the way that labels are set up. I don't agree that anybody should sign 360 deals or sign away their publishing or do, or take most of the infrastructure that's included in a formal deal. But I've learned to not be like, you know, fuck this company and fuck this company, even though a lot of those people tried to make it really hard for me to release my project.\nZL: How do they do that? How do they make it hard, when you're independent, take your business to the point where if one more label tries to stop me. That it becomes a hook.\nCTR: Well here's the thing, most people are signed, right? So, say, say you make a project and there's twelve Universal artists on it. And then not only do they find out after the fact that you've recorded with these artists and that you plan on making videos with these artists, but they find out also on top of it that you plan to release it for free. So that's when you get phone calls where people are trying to tell you that they own your friends, or that you can't make any decisions without them being a part of it. And you, you know. I only use Universal as an example because those are my people and they helped me get the project done. But, you know, for the people that aren't named, you know, there is that kind of interference that happens when you're trying to push something out that people feel like they own. You know? Or trying to give something away that people feel\nZL: Yea it's a lot of investors coming in after the fact\nCTR: It's a lot of suits and ties of people that don't know how the fuck to play notes telling you the value of what you're making or whatever you're doing.\nZL: Have you ever been tempted and I only raise it because there have been little hints along the way I mean even on the new record there's a couple of moments where you talk about you know \"Kanye's best prodigy, he never signed me\" and I wondered if that was ever on the table. And I think it's \"Angels\" where you say \"Fuck it, maybe I should sign to OVO\" was that that record where you said that?\nCTR: Yea that is, that's, yea I mean I've had, everybody has had that conversation. We've had all the conversations. And what's funny is that some of those conversations still keep coming back. But with Kanye, it was cool because he did offer me a deal but still worked with me diligently, you know, after knowing that that wasn't what I wanted to do. And I used the word \"prodigy\" because I can't really, I wouldn't go as far to call myself Kanye's prot\u00e9g\u00e9 because I didn't have that experience that some of my best friends got working right underneath him. I think that the word \"prodigy\" is cool cause like, I was just a kid that he knows, that, and I am still a kid and am still growing and don't you know, fully understand how everything works and my potential or what I'm going to do. But I'm, I had the insight of Ye being around me at the point where I've kind of already decided a path to be like \"Yo, you should sign. No you're not gonna sign? Cool, let's get this money.\"\nPart 4. 30:58 to 40:28\nZL: Yea. You could sell music independently, it's not like one goes without the other, there are a lot of independent artists who have sold their records and have sold them at a very competitive price in order to survive but also to not feel like you're causing anybody financial disservice as a fan. Why the decision not to sell this record still?\nCTR: I think in part, a big part of it is that we are at such a crucial time in terms of music, I mean before, I know it's being highly publicised now, this, this, you know, the what is it the National Recording Arts and Sciences, I don't know what they're called, but those guys had been having a conversation I think up to at least a year ago about changing some of the verbage in their rules and how they're inclusive of, um\nZL: Awards, charts, all that kind of stuff. And there's been changes in streaming on the charts as well\nCTR: Yea, so the charts are already changing, they're including streaming. I still don't necessarily agree with, how they, it's something like every 1,000 streams is a sale\nZL: Is like one purchase\nCTR: Or something? I don't know, I don't really care about that. But at least they're making that move and I think the Grammys started making the move I think about a year ago they started voting on it, I don't know cause I don't really, I'm not on Grammy board anymore, but they uh\nZL: But you were!\nCTR: Yea, back in the day! But they originally, or the wording is that they can't nominate a project unless it's released, unless it's a commercial release, right?\nZL: Right. And does it qualify now that you're on streaming?\nCTR: No. But that's the thing, because of this timing I think it was important to have these mixtapes be trilogised and be a thing that existed. Regardless of how the revolution goes, you know, I know that I was not on the bus when everything was changing. You know what I'm saying? And I was like \"fuck it, I'm still dropping mixtapes.\" Now whatever's next, I don't really know, I've kind of, am a little turned off from making music right this second cause I'm still sick and shit, and I just did a project. But like, you know, I know that I did the three projects exactly how I wanted to and that they were mixtapes and that's where I came from.\nZL: Trilogy's perfect. Does it feel like now that cap has signified the end of that particular era for you, in some respects?\nCTR: I think for sure. Like I mean I wouldn't necessarily say that I'm not making anymore mixtapes cause I, I like making mixtapes I might make a tape with Jay Electronica soon, I might make a tape with anybody, let me stop doing that.\nZL: I'm excited.\nCTR: That's cool, and it'll be awesome but I think for sure that mode of projects was its own thing.\nZL: Yea for sure.\nCTR: And I had to make certain statements because I was in the climate that I was in but will, like we were just saying, when 10 Day came out they didn't count streams. And\nZL: Thing's changed so much even since then.\nCTR: Yea and I think everything will continue to change but I think we do have to think about being inclusive in terms of artists that don't necessarily have a label attached to them or want to release music commercially cause that doesn't have anything to do with artistic excellence, which is what they celebrate you know and because it's you know where this is the shit moving forward, you know it's gotta move forward but let shit change, you know what I'm saying?\nZL: Let's talk about Jay Electronica for a second\nCTR: Yea, let's do that for a minute.\nZL: For a few minutes!\nCTR: For a few minutes!\nZL: We talk about about Jay Elec. I mean, a guy who's sorta opens the door, comes into the room for a hot second lays waste and then disappears again. So to have him on a song as powerful as \"How Great\" is it still your favourite song on your work, it's really unbelievable man, you know real emotional, powerful piece of music. What I really love about that as well is just talking from a total rap nerd's point of view for a second is that you almost chameleon-like adopt his flow for a minute in the beginning\nCTR: Oh yea completely\nZL: Deliberately, you know to create a synergy. I love that. I was listening to it and was like \"is that Jay Elec?\" at first and you were like \"da, ba-da, ba-da, ba-da\" that sort of like tripping flow that he does.\nCTR: What is it? I'm trying to remember like, oh \"Candyman, Candyman, spit me a dream.\" What is it? \"Blow a chunk of the levee out and spit me a stream.\" Yea so that's, yea, but no I'm probably - I mean, somebody could fight me for it - but I feel like I'm Jay Electronica's biggest fan.\nZL: Haha now we're all in that line!\nCTR: But it's, I've always been, you know what I'm saying very, for as long as I can remember like back to high school, I was \"Jay Elec, very tough.\" And he's a very well-read, well-educated dude and-\nZL: When he speaks it's totally believable. Cause he's at that point in his life where, what he's talking about he's lived. That's unique.\nCTR: Definitely. I mean, there's a line in his verse on the project where he says, he says, \"Jay Elec would've never made it, O' son of man, O' son of man. Who is the angel that stood on Earth with a foot on water and a foot on land? Who is the angel that rode a Harley from the projects to the parliament?\" And then that line I'm like \"who is that angel?\" cause you know he's dropping mad, spiritual text references, these are joints that you really have to look up, you might need somebody you has a degree in that shit to really know what the fuck he's talking about. The last line about riding a Harley to the house of parliament, I mean that's not a reference that's his life he's talking about himself like that shit really happened. And I don't know when that happened or what that means but like that's Jay Electronica talking about some really, crazy spiritual shit that he's taking over and shit.\nZL: He's really one of the greats and I think in many respects as frustrating as it is for us while we sit around and wait around for more music it just adds to that, you know\nCTR: Well I think this was The Prestige, if anybody knows what I'm talking about I think, or at least the beginning of the third Act, like he's in that space of like, you know, he had a song that I used to love where he has the sample, it's like Elijah Muhammad where he talks about, like a king has to, has to leave the people and go away and wait til he can come back and manifest, it's written, his time.\nZL: Let's talk about \"Juke Jam\" on the record, which is, which is one of those songs which, I've been reading a lot of press and reflections about the record and that one's bubbling up as people continue to analyse the album and pick their favourites, cause are going so deep on this on the thinking process or thought process. And \"Juke Jam\" is one of those songs that people are feeling.\nCTR: Yea, and I love that. Isn't that weird though? Cause it's, well I guess it's, well that record is like very, very Chicago and like almost, you know, excluding, you know I was kind of worried that people wouldn't really connect to the record cause it's, you know, about a specific place that I think even certain Chicagoans don't know about I'm actually sure of certain Chicagoans don't know about.\nZL: Can you tell us more about it?\nCTR: Yea, I mean when I was a shorty we used to go to this spot down the street from Avalon Park called The Rink and it was a roller rink but really it was a... Have you ever seen ATL? Probably not.\nZL: No.\nCTR: So there's like a movie called ATL and they go to Cascade and it's like, it's the same thing in that movie it's just like a place where like I did actually get into my first fight and got my first juke and, like, I, there's obviously a giant roller rink on the floor but it's about what's happening out by the lockers. That's like, that's like the world that we was in.\nZL: I think it's cool that you've involved Justin Bieber in that song because you two have a friendship that goes back and there was a key moment, I remember, reading about when you know you guys were on the same stage at Coachella and that was like a defining moment for both of you because what it did was it opened up the parameters of what was actually the perception of the two of you. It was like \"why is Chance fucking with Justin Bieber?\" and then \"why is Justin Bieber on stage with Chance?\" and like how does it work? And like, it was kind of cool.\nCTR: Yea that's my fucking boy, like he's the shit and he's just very dope at everything that he does, at writing, at singing, he's an amazing vocalist.\nZL: How did you guys even meet? Like how did that happen?\nCTR: How did me and Justin meet... Me and Justin met actually after we made \"Confident\" so I won't say that me and Justin were friends when we made \"Confident\" but I was a fan.\nZL: Of course you were, you wouldn't have jumped on if it wasn't.\nCTR: Exactly. And we met at Coachella and hung out all day that day before I went on stage and it wasn't til, like right before I went on stage that he was like\nZL: That was the day you met?\nCTR: That was the day I met him, we sat backstage and sm- and chilled\nZL: Hahahaha\nCTR: And, just chilled, and, then right before I went on stage he was like \"you want me to come out for a song?\" and I was like \"yea let's have a dance battle.\" And we did\nZL: That's crazy\nCTR: And he crushed me. But only cause I was so tired, I'd been performing the whole day\nZL: Real tired, like tired!\nCTR: I'm cold, in real life! I probably just yelled on this microphone and shit\nZL: It's a cool record, I really dig it, I really like it. But you know what I also like is the fact that getting away from the famos for a second, and talking about, I wanna talk about some of the new people on the record too and you know the fact that you're always looking out for people that are gonna bring a different shade to what you do, a different vibe to what you do. You know Knox being a classic example.\nPart 5. 40:29 to 50:01\nCTR: Yea, so I mean, Knox Fortune is one of my favourite producers, he's like been in the background and produced on a lot of records that I worked on and a lot of records for my friends, and we you know, have a bunch of collaborations that didn't really see the light you know. But that one, that record  was so dope because I had it for like a week before he touched it, and it was just me talking on the record saying \"All night, I been drinkin' all night, I been drinkin' all night.\" And he was like \"yo let me touch that\" and brought it back and it was, you know, I mean he's, he's Chicago, so\nZL: What is it about Chicago man? Like, I mean it's definitely one of the creative capitals in the world for music, you know you could put it right next to sort of a Manchester or a Liverpool, now of course people talk about Toronto having its moment, but you know there are places, Berlin, there are places where music lives. Why Chicago, why is it, having grown up in it?\nCTR: I think, I mean one it's like just a very cultured place, like you know we have, you know Chicago's a big city but it's in the middle of Illinois. You know what I'm saying? And like, all of the suburban areas around us like kind of like create this wall of like, you know, inclusive sound and shit, and I think on top of that obviously it's just we've never had a music industry and I think because there was no industry or big labels posted there it gave everybody a lot of air to like make what the fuck they wanted to make. And bred a lot of you know, just awesome talent across all genres.\nZL: There's one really funny lyric in there that made me smile on that song where you were like, \"you just wanna talk politics and Chicago shit\"\nCTR: Yea yea\nZL: And that was just funny to me because it's like, ok you just released this records that's like totally dedicated to Chicago, all anyone's gonna wanna talk about is Chicago and now, you've opened the flood gates, this is it, this is your time, Chicago's the new favourite, here you go and already it's like you're already over it! Hahaha\nCTR: Yea! Well, like that song, to me, is the best song that I've ever written because it's such an awesome concept. The idea behind it is that I'm at this party and there's women all over me and, you know, there's professionals in suits all over me, and, haha, people that are telling me they're my cousin and shit, and in my mind all everybody wants from me is a ride home. And I think that's just such a funny, stupid, concept, but to build off of it and to kind of make it connect in a way that, you know, \"Now, oh now you wanna chill, now you wanna build\" you know what I'm saying? \"Now you got the bill.\" It's, it's\nZL: Gas money, cash money\nCTR: Exactly. All of that shit is a fun concept I think because I do get fucked up at parties and get paranoid and I think it's just really funny to bring it back to just everybody wanting a ride... \"Oh you my cousin? No you wasn't\" hahahaha\nZL: You made a record that is really a love letter for Chicago, it's a positive, uplifting, listen for a city that's been well documented either by the conventional media, front-face media which I call like the real kind of, how would I call it, like a modern media like Vice have gone out there and done a piece on it, you've got movies that have been made about it I mean, there's a story about it being told right now. You've done it in a way that's uplifting, which kind of contradicts everyone else's take on it. And I wondered what the challenges were in creating such an uplifting, positive-sounding record during such a tumultuous time.\nCTR: Yea. Well I mean there's definitely a challenge to it because it goes against public perception but it's not a stretch. I mean, Chicago's beautiful, people there are beautiful, events happening all the time, like beautiful music being made and, you know, there are like very dark shadowy parts of it and I think rather than, you know, Vice documentary-style pointing at shit and being like isn't this weird, it's kind of like being, you know, just shedding light in all of those areas. Like, you know, we talk a lot about 79th on the record because I want people to walk down 79th and sing \"79th\" in a way that doesn't necessarily go with whatever Spike Lee made in Chiraq you know what I'm saying? And it's not a lie, you know what I'm saying, it's not like, you know, this this terrible, dystopic, place. I'm from there, you know what I'm saying, and I'm like the happiest, again, like I'm happy.\nZL: What was it like growing up there?\nCTR: I mean, it's kind of hard because it was all I knew for so long, I didn't start travelling til I was like nineteen or twenty but like, it's super communal. Super small. Everybody's a person away from knowing someone. Everybody's cousin is somebody else's cousin. My mom graduated from Kenwood and I know like everybody in Hyde Park because of it. My dad graduated from  by my house because of it, was the block club president. So like I'm very intertwined in this city in terms of like, knowing people and knowing areas and shit.\nZL: Is there a movie to be made, I know like you were very vocal about you didn't like the way Chiraq presented the city, but is there a movie to be made and is it something you could see yourself being involved in, or in fact are involved in for all we know?\nCTR: I mean, I'm not, hmm. That's a good question. I think that the media that I make now is dope for Chicago and I think there are amazing filmmakers in Chicago that could make some type of think-piece. I'm not, I wasn't critical of Chiraq for the simple fact that I thought I could make a better movie. I just didn't think that that was any type of representation of the city it felt like it was written about somewhere else, some fantastical place and then they just put it in my city. But, I think, my main goal right now is you now making music and I've kind of been getting into theatre a little bit like you know, I want to write some type of think-piece for the theatre but\nZL: Would you do that on script-level as well as musical? On multiple levels?\nCTR: Yea, I mean like I really like screenwriting like that's not something that I'm foreign to at all.\nZL: And how many would you say that you've tried or attempted to write?\nCTR: Two\nZL: So you've finished two?\nCTR: Yea, there's one that's about a Hallowe'en party and then there's one that's like an existential, like I don't know it's like an up in the air thing where there's like this guy... I don't wanna talk about that one, I don' t know that I'm actually making that one but the first one\nZL: Halloween party stupid, so we can call that by name\nCTR: We'll call it The Stupid Halloween Party\nZL That's so fire, that's the shit, what an awesome name!\nCTR: Haha no if I would've named it that\nZL: Back on the table, cause of the name\nCTR: Let's go!\nZL: So as we sort of go through, this has been fun by the way\nCTR: This has been awesome. I'm chillin, I keep forgetting we're in an interview\nZL: I want to talk about family, because we're both family men. I've got kids, you have a newborn, how old now?\nCTR: She just turned 8 months on Monday\nZL: Congratulations\nCTR: Yea\nZL: So this is, you've documented this on the record which is again now, a lovely tone on the album, the honesty, and just the vulnerability and the heartfelt nature of it. And I read somewhere actually in an article that the cover artwork is a painting of you looking at your daughter as well. So, how has that experience been for you becoming a father?\nCTR: I mean, it's the greatest happening of my life and, you know, feels a lot like the beginning of my life\nZL: Right? It's hard to think about what you did before! I have no idea\nCTR: Yea it's crazy, tripping. But I mean it definitely comes with all, you know, a lot of hardships and shit you know and I think it's well documented on the album. One of my favourite records is a song I made with Future on it called \"Smoke Break\" and I think Future was perfect for it cause he's a father too and that record, I remember I started making it and my girlfriend came in and she didn't like it at first, now it's her favourite song. But the song talks about, you know, it's another song that uses drugs as a metaphor for relationships or sex or whatever but you know, there really is a whole turning point in terms of your priorities and your schedule and we really did lose for a second, you know, the respect of time for ourselves and the respect of time to just take a break, put the baby down for a second and like, enjoy each other's company.\nZL: Having been in and around, somewhat of a political environment, albeit local body politics, in that situation and your dad working with Barack Obama when he was a senator and being exposed to that and I think that it makes sense now listening to your music and the way that you talk about Chicago from the point of view of Chicago as it comes from a community-driven place. What does it mean to you, or what do you think it means to a generation right now because I mean in essence I think a lot of artists are saying things that people probably look to politicians and policy makers to say. You know, and then in some respects those things aren't really that forthcoming from a lot of political circles, it seems to be in particular chaos right now internationally, politically.\nPart 6. 50:02 to 60:53\nCTR: Yea, I think there was always... you know, I think the word \"politics\" you know, sounds dirty to me, when I even think about it. But I never really saw my dad as working in politics, like whenever he, whenever I went to his job or he talked about what he was working on, I always saw, you know, that same idea of being a good man and working on projects that will help people. So when my dad took any job it was always kind of a state director position, or a head of community outreach, it was always about building a bigger communal space, networking with all the, all the, the heads of religious organisations, of community initiatives, being in contact with and always on with people that are trying to make a difference and being, spearheading, really, a lot of initiatives.\nZL: You must be proud man, do you know what he thinks about the record you just made and the music you play?\nCTR: I hope so, I'm proud of my dad like that's what, that's what's so funny is he says he's proud of me all the time and that's like, that's a dope thing coming from somebody that moves shit in the physical you know what I'm saying. Versus like, I mean I do try and do physical shit but like I, my shit is like a lot more\nZL: Well you have to get physical now, we have to talk about the road bro. Because the album is done. And it's been a minute, do you think about it? Are you in plans?\nCTR: Definitely. So I mean like, touring the music is going to be so easy just in terms of like the sound and pure audio of it and the sequencing of the show.\nZL: It will be you and The Experiment?\nCTR: Yea. It's always gonna be me and The Experiment. That just works. You can't, you can't say, if it ain't broke. Do you know what I'm saying.\nZL: Is it gonna be The Experiment and extended family?\nCTR: Probably. Yea. The last two shows I got to play with Francis And The Lights. People won't know that unless you were at those two shows but like, you know. And I know Francis is about to drop his album so I probably shouldn't even say that cause he probably won't be with me but still, you know.\nZL: Put it out there.\nCTR: You know like I've always wanted to bring a bigger theatre feeling to Chicago. And when I say theatre I mean specifically like a Broadway sense like New York's theatre scene strives, thrives because they have Broadway and they have like a row of theatres and a very uplifted theatre scene. And I think\nZL: Is this something that will permeate through your terrain do you think?\nCTR: I think it's on the other end of it just because it's a stagnant thing. I want to build a building that people come in to like see, you know like an attraction? Like the world's biggest  that's on the road somewhere and people drive to go see that.\nZL: How hard are you gonna tour this record, fans are gonna want to know. I mean you've been to Europe, you've been around America, you haven't been to Australasia, you haven't been to probably Asia?\nCTR: So we'll be in Asia, Australia, New Zealand - can I say New Zealand and Australia or is that the same thing?\nZL: No they're not the same thing\nCTR: I knew they're not the same thing, I just wanted to check with you Zane\nZL: Yep! We categorically confirm we are not the same thing! But we're friends!\nCTR: And so, so New Zealand as well as Australia. Definitely gotta go back to Europe. And I think a very important thing that we're trying to work out right now is being in Africa outside of being in South Africa.\nZL: Amazing.\nCTR: And then maybe we'll do something in America too. Possibly.\nZL: I hope so! You imagine making this record...\nCTR: Wouldn't that be sick though?\nZL: ... just to not...\nCTR: Make everyone else travel for it? That's the new thing is, you gotta travel for music. That's why festivals are dope cause people go out of their way to go see a festival, but that's the same shit I was just talking about.\nZL: When's the touring gonna start? Do you know?\nCTR: I do know. I guess when this comes out the tickets will probably already drop so September.\nZL: I got a couple quick fire things to get through before we get up and out of here then let's get some fresh air. So number one, you mentioned something the other day when you were doing your Reddit questionnaire you mentioned about the Childish Gambino mixtape, is that ever gonna see the light of day?\nCTR: Yea, I know for a fact that it's gonna come out by fall, I think\nZL: He's all nervous now I put him on the spot\nCTR: The thing is, I don't wanna say too much, Donald is like my older brother and like, I can say some shit that will get me in trouble. He's working on his TV show so I should say that first. And Atlanta's amazing, he's out there right now finishing up the TV show and the tape is not done, or close to being done. But it will come out.\nZL: You've got some skin in the game.\nCTR: Yep.\nZL: \"No Problem,\" we have to talk about \"No Problem\" because it is without a doubt one of the best songs of the year within the framework of the album.\nCTR: Thank you.\nZL: I think I played it for like thirty minutes straight when we played it on Beats.\nCTR: You did. And thank you for that.\nZL: Thank you.\nCTR: I got a lot of tweets about it they said they liked that.\nZL: No the song's incredible obviously brining 2 Chainz and Lil Wayne into it and creating such a really great chemistry on that record. It isn't always easy when you've got you know guest bars coming in, sometimes it can feel as though it's been sent in my tape or whatever, or digitally. Tell us about that song, tell as what that song means to you and, people have never heard you talk about it.\nCTR: Yea I mean that song is everything that it's supposed to sound like, it's supposed to sound like the smash record that came from \"the other,\" you know what I'm saying? It's supposed to feel like what this year is supposed to feel like when we take a chance on \"the other\" and fuck with, you know what I'm saying, some dope shit that came organically. And it is banging on the doors of all of those labels and letting them know, like, literally and figuratively, like don't tweak. Stop trying to stop what I'm doing, you know, I'm over here, you're over there, do your thing. But like in both ways don't keep doing it.\nZL: But, I'm gonna say it over the biggest hit record of my career to date\nCTR: Yea, well I mean that's the way that you say some shit, I mean I can't say it quietly in an email or like it's, I think that it meant the most to me to have, you know, to have Wayne come on there and speak what he spoke\nZL: Great, great verse too\nCTR: Yea, I mean it still fucking scares me to this day to see that I have two records now with Lil Wayne. But, you know what I'm saying, I think to have him come in it and have him backing it up, cause there is a Chicago version of that record that will come out at some point and it does have, you know what I'm saying, the people I wanted to have on the record, but this version made sense for the album\nZL: Chicago people?\nCTR: Yea, I don't need to say who it is, it'll come out. But it's huge. It's having them do it, I think people that are juggernauts in the game stand next to me and also say like don't tweak on him. You know what I'm saying? I think it was poignant and it made its way to everyones' ears that it was supposed to.\nZL: Who's Big Fella?\nCTR: Oh, so you don't know who Ha Ha Davis is? Of course you don't know who Ha Ha Davis is. Ha Ha Davis is the fucking funniest of all time. And he's from Detroit and you know what I'm saying he's just like a comedian, a new age comedian so he's on Instagram, is where we all watch him from. But I've been a fan, everybody in Chicago says \"big fella\" cause its some Midwest shit at this point, it's some South shit now too like everyone says \"big fella.\" But I was a fan and I hit him up, I think a week before we went to Atlanta, or actually like two days before we went to Atlanta to shoot the \"No Problem\" video. And I was like \"yo, will you come with me just rock with me\" and we went out and just hung out together and met people together and now he's one of my closest friends. After he was in the video, I was like \"yo, will you narrate this whole project?\" So he was on four out of like fifteen of the, well he was on \"Grown Ass Kid,\" his main monologue is on \"Grown Ass Kid\" which, the labels, they stopped me. It didn't make it on the project.\nZL: Can you just get it out anyway? Just find a home for it?\nCTR: I actually found out recently that the record leaked and it's online but its official release is gonna be on Cam O'bi's project who's one of my favourite producers and did, he did \"Good Ass Outro,\" the outro from Acid Rap and \"Blessings\" on this new project, like the reprise. And he did three records on this project that all got stopped.\nZL: So much stopping\nCTR: Yea\nZL: No more stopping.\nCTR: Yea, don't try anything anymore.\nZL: No more.\nCTR: Can I show you this Big Sean song that was supposed to be on the project that got stopped? You probably couldn't play it on the broadcast cause it wasn't a cleared single.\nBroadcast paused while Chance plays song privately\nZL: It's interesting cause like, to me it's dope as hell like I love that but it's funny now listening to Coloring Book\nCTR: You feel it wouldn't have fit?\nZL: It feels like\nCTR: Everything happens for a reason.\nZL: Crazy right? Still man, hearing you and Sean together.\nCTR: It would've been perfect. It's funny cause Sean, Jeremih and Cole all tour together and those are like my three best friends in music. And we had three songs altogether that were all collaborative songs and they all got stopped. Luckily, Jeremih still ended up on \"Summer Friends\" but Jeremih was on like three or four songs on Coloring Book.\nZL: Man, the more you tell it the more I realise like we're lucky we got anything at all.\nCTR: Yea\nZL: Out of the guests at least, it'll sure\nCTR: It'll never happen like that again though. All it takes is, is, I think the growth of the artists, plural, and the retraction of the control, and then... I don't think, I don't think there will ever be a release again from me that feels controlled.\nZL: You don't want zero problems.\nCTR: They definitely don't want a single one.\nZL: Hahaha. Love you man.\nCTR: Thank you\nZL: Thank you\nCTR: Naw, this was awesome."}}, {"title": "2017 Grammy's Best New Artist Speech", "album": null, "year": "2017-02-12", "lyrics": "Glory be to God.

local, I'm on that global\nI often had dreams of being locked in my momma's Volvo\nWatching the garage burn down, I'm off the codo\nI'm off the top, I'm off some pot, I'm off Ciroc\nI'm off a lot, they gave me 10 Days off\nThat's an awful lot, I was off campus, but the officer\nTold the office, that he saw me from the parking lot\nBut it's all good, I'm off that\nI'm just finna off his ass, off of the Ave while rocking all black\nDip off and hide the garbage bags in the dip spot\nJust to make sure that I don't get caught\nBuying hella bug spray, making sure I get off\nThey told me go on and rock it, I told them that it's lift off\nHow all my homies get caught, picked off by a dick cop\nWhy you allowing hiccups, why you just didn't slip off?\nAnd now I'm at the precinct, and I'm off of my square\nHaving a white cop beat me while he offers me squares\nYou gon' torture me yeah? Well that's awfully fair\nAll for nothing, tryna tweak me like you offering years\nBitch I ain't scared, I'm already here\nTell ya partners and ya friends, the next coffin is theirs\nGuess what bitch, I'm from internal affairs\nLooking for crooked cops, to tweak so I can offer 'em years\nHave me tweaking, like I'm all full of fear... alright, I'm tweaking"}}, {"title": "ABCs Song Remix", "album":

in backless dresses\nWore my feelings on my sleeveless\nMy weed seedless, my trees leafless\nI miss my diagonal grilled cheeses\nAnd back when Mike Jackson was still Jesus\nBefore I believed in not believing in\nYeah, I inhaled, who believed in me not breathing in\nCigarette stained smile all covered in sin\nMy big homie died young; just turned older than him\nI seen it happen, I seen it happen, I see it always\nHe still be screaming, I see his demons in empty hallways\nI trip to make the fall shorter\nFall quarter was just a tall order\nAnd I'm hungry, I'm just not that thirsty\nAs of late, all my verses seem not so verse-y\nAnd all my words just mean controversy\nTook the team up off my back, like \"That's not your jersey?\"\nStressin', pullin' my hair out, hoping I don't get picked\nAll this medicine in me hoping I don't get sick\nMaking all of this money hoping I don't get rich\n'Cause niggas still getting bodied for foams\nSometimes the truth don't rhyme\nSometime the lies get millions of views\nFunerals for little girls, is that appealing to you?\nFrom your cubicle desktop, what a beautiful view\nI think love is beautiful too\nBuilding forts from broken dams, what a hoover could do\nFor future hoopers dead from Rugers\nShooting through the empty alley\nCould've threw him an alley-oop\nHelping him do good in school\nDamn that acid burn when it clean ya\nI still miss being a senior\nAnd performing at all those open mic events\nEyes closed, eyes closed seeing arenas\nAnd I still get jealous of Vic\nAnd Vic's still jealous of me\nBut if you touch my brother\nAll that anti-violence shit goes out the window along with you\nAnd the rest of your team\nSmoking cigarettes to look cooler\nI only stop by to look through ya\nAnd I'm only getting greedier\nAnd I'm still Mr. Youmedia\nAnd I still can't find Talent\nAnd I'm still choosing classmates that wouldn't fuck\nMom still thinks I should go back to school\nAnd Justin still thinks I'm good enough\nAnd Mama Jan still don't take her meds\nAnd I still be asking God to show his face\nAnd I still be asking God to show his face\n\nI am a new man, I am sanctified\nOh, I am holy, I have been baptized\nI have been born again, I am the White Light\nRain, rain don't go away", "image": "https://images.rapgenius.com/0574afd0cb4ecc8e46e2090b7896d3ca.300x300x1.jpg", "artist": "Chance The

snatch-less necklace\nSpineless bitches in backless dresses\nWore my feelings on my sleeveless\nMy weed seedless, my trees leafless\nI miss my diagonal grilled cheeses\nAnd back when Mike Jackson was still Jesus\nBefore I believed in not believing in\nYeah, I inhaled, who believed in me not breathing in\nCigarette stained smile all covered in sin\nMy big homie died young; just turned older than him\nI seen it happen, I seen it happen, I see it always\nHe still be screaming, I see his demons in empty hallways\nI trip to make the fall shorter\nFall quarter was just a tall order\nAnd I'm hungry, I'm just not that thirsty\nAs of late, all my verses seem not so verse-y\nAnd all my words just mean controversy\nTook the team up off my back, like \"That's not your jersey?\"\nStressin', pullin' my hair out, hoping I don't get picked\nAll this medicine in me hoping I don't get sick\nMaking all of this money hoping I don't get rich\n'Cause niggas still getting bodied for foams\nSometimes the truth don't rhyme\nSometime the lies get millions of views\nFunerals for little girls, is that appealing to you?\nFrom your cubicle desktop, what a beautiful view\nI think love is beautiful too\nBuilding forts from broken dams, what a hoover could do\nFor future hoopers dead from Rugers\nShooting through the empty alley\nCould've threw him an alley-oop\nHelping him do good in school\nDamn that acid burn when it clean ya\nI still miss being a senior\nAnd performing at all those open mic events\nEyes closed, eyes closed seeing arenas\nAnd I still get jealous of Vic\nAnd Vic's still jealous of me\nBut if you touch my brother\nAll that anti-violence shit goes out the window along with you\nAnd the rest of your team\nSmoking cigarettes to look cooler\nI only stop by to look through ya\nAnd I'm only getting greedier\nAnd I'm still Mr. Youmedia\nAnd I still can't find Talent\nAnd I'm still choosing classmates that wouldn't fuck\nMom still thinks I should go back to school\nAnd Justin still thinks I'm good enough\nAnd Mama Jan still don't take her meds\nAnd I still be asking God to show his face\nAnd I still be asking God to show his face\n\nI am a new man, I am sanctified\nOh, I am holy, I have been baptized\nI have been born again, I am the White Light\nRain, rain don't go away"}}, {"title": "Acid Rap [Artwork]", "album": "Acid Rap", "year": "2013-04-30",

every father, mayor, rapper jump ship\nI guess that's why they call it where I stay\nClean up the streets, so my daughter can have somewhere to play\nI'm the blueprint to a real man\nSome of these niggas toss they tassel for a deal man\nI ain't goin' to hell or to Hillman\nIgh, Igh, Igh, Igh, for my real fans\nI got caught up with a little Xan\nCan't stop me but it slow me though\nYeah a nigga famous, you don't know me though\nBut every DJ still play me though\nDamn man, I don't even need a radio\nAnd my new shit sound like a rodeo\nGot the old folks dancing the Do-si-do\n'Til they fuck around and sign me to OVO\nOooh, I just might share my next one with Keef\nGot the industry in disbelief, they be asking for beef\nThis what it sound like when God split an atom with me\nI even had Steve giving out apples for free\n\nThey was talking \"woo this woo wap da bam\"\nCity so damn great, I feel like Alexand'\nWear your halo like a hat, that's like the latest fashion\nI got angels all around me they keep me surrounded\n\nWho is you, and who the fuck is you, and who is him?\nAll of a sudden, woo wap da bam\nYou can't touch me\nNa, na, na, na, I got angels\nI got angels\n\nI ain't change my number since the seventh grade\nThis for my day one, ten years, seven days\nA week, niggas never tired on they Kevin Gates\nAnd if they rest in peace they bunny hopping heaven's gates\nIt's too many young angels on the southside\nGot us scared to let our grandmommas outside\nYou gon' make me take the campers way downtown\nYou gon' make me turn my BM to my housewife\nI just had a growth spurt\nIt done took so long, my tippy toes hurt\nYou can keep the nose ring, I don't have to soul search\nI'm still at my old church, only ever sold merch\nGrandma say I'm Kosher, momma say I'm culture\nGCI, 1-0-7-5, angel goin' live\nPower 92, angel, juke, angel gon' juke\nGCI, 1-0-7-5, goin' live\nPower 92, angel gon' juke, juke, juke, juke\n\nThey was talking \"woo this woo wap da bam\"\nCity so damn great, I feel like Alexand'\nWear your halo like a hat, that's like the latest fashion\nI got angels all around me, they keep me surrounded\nWap the bam (na, na, na, na)\nI got

sipping, fuck around they missing, hold on (swoop), hold on\nBig pimping, iced out my crew now my mission complete\nPimp C, I ain't doing that, I'ma fuck her on the sheets, yeah\nAnd all my niggas loyal like Bun B, hold on\nFuck you thought? YSL till we d-i-e, hold on, hold on, hol' on\nFuck around and set the bitch off like Queen Latifah\nHold on, hold on, yeah, going all out 'bout my dog like Scooby-ee\nAnd a nigga trap door swinging like busy bee, woah (Busy bee)\nOutdated temporary tag on a Bentley B (Bentley B)\nTwo tone wire bag, double R, park it on the streets, yeah, hold on\nTwo tone wire bag, big tires tear up the streets, rwar\nLooking at your kid, I might be the papi (sheesh)\n65 pointers in the Cuban sheesh (damn, woah, sheesh)\nDiamonds on the backside tearing up my skin, sheesh\nUh, your old man tryna do it like me, sheesh\n\nPlease, please\nTreat me like you know who I am\nPlease, please\nBitch I know who I am, uh\n\nI got money on my card\nPut some money on they books, that's a yard\nI declare war on the beast for my God, sheesh\nGross 3 mil' off the new hat\nIf I could go back, I'd make a two cap\nLove me in my city like Cusack\nGet a little beat and I'll loop that\nGet a little money, I'll oop that\nSplit it with my niggas in the group chat\nLeft for a minute then I flew back\nHad to ask Bruce \"where the truth at?\"\nHad to ask Rahm \"where the truth at?\"\nNow I can't ride with the roof back\nTell 'em I don't play around with other people's kids\nGot an office in the steakhouse\nGotta bid for the ribs\nGot a meeting at the Ritz\nGave a crib to my rib\n'Cause she leaving where I live but I see her in a min\nGot a Michael prayer card for the good luck, ay\nBra push up when I pull up, ay\nGot a little money from the tour, yeah\nSpend it all on baby pull ups, ay\nBig old Bentley, bitch I mix the Henny with the Simply\nLemonade exterior, Lorenzos under Bentleys\nPut you in the friend zone if you start acting too friendly\nBought a baby Benzo and some Kenzo just for Kensli\nWake up real early but I eat late\nGo and hit the streets with that briefcase\nTime to shake down another cheap skate\nYou could tell he's lying, cheesecake\n\nMake a nigga bitch tap out\nThen put 24\u2019s on a real big body\nBitch said nigga need to stop got 100 racks on me\nCan't fit in my pocket\nI'm a street nigga, I'ma eat me some soup, I'ma let my bitch eat pasta\nTold y'all niggas ain't stopping\nBlack card in my wallet, I'ma feed my partner\nI was at one of my shows feeling like Cam'ron with the pink Margielas\nWe was tryna beat a murder capital, riding around the town with the pink Beretta\nWhen I got in touch with the money, me and shawty fucked around and filled my schedule\nMomma just sent me a picture got Indian in my family through my God damn nana\nYoung nigga fucked 'round, dropped out school, learned it all through the ID channel\nYoung nigga fucked around and ran out of bullets in the .40, got to get a banana\nThese young niggas go brazy, done got that money, they still might pop\nSo many blue faces on me right now, young nigga still gamble\n35 racks for the factories, I steal mammals\nI ain't no rapper nigga, I geolog'\nI'm a big dog, no pedigree, I eat racks\nBoomerang your bitch sweet, she coming back\n\nPlease, please\nTreat me like you know who I am\nPlease, please\nBitch I know who I am, uh"}}, {"title": "Blessings", "album": "Coloring Book",

the blessings come down\nIt seems like blessings keep falling in my lap\nIt seems like blessings keep falling in my lap\n\nI don't make songs for free, I make 'em for freedom\nDon't believe in kings, believe in the Kingdom\nChisel me into stone, prayer whistle me into song air\nDying laughing with Krillin saying something 'bout blonde hair\nJesus' black life ain't matter, I know I talked to his daddy\nSaid you the man of the house now, look out for your family\nHe has ordered my steps,  gave me a sword with a crest\nAnd gave Donnie a trumpet in case I get shortness of breath\n\nI'm gon' praise Him, praise Him 'til I'm gone\nDon't be mad\nI'm gon' praise Him, praise Him 'til I'm gone\nWhen the praises go up\n(Good God)\nThe blessings come down\nGood God\nWhen the praises go up (Good God) the blessings come down\n( the blessings come down)\nWhen the praises go up, the blessings come down\n(It seems like blessings keep falling in my lap)\nThe blessings come down\nWhen the praises go up, the blessings come down\n(Good God)\n\nThey booked the nicest hotels on the 59th floor\nWith the big wide windows, with the suicide doors\nAin't no blood on my money, ain't no Twitter in Heaven\nI know them drugs isn't close, ain't no visitin' Heaven\nI know the difference in blessings and worldly possessions\nLike my ex girl getting pregnant\nAnd her becoming my everything\nI'm at war with my wrongs, I'm writing four different songs\nI never forged it or forfeited, I'm a force to be reconciled\nThey want four minute songs\nYou need a four hour praise dance performed every morn\nI'm feeling shortness of breath, so Nico grab you a horn\nHit Jericho with a buzzer beater to end a quarter\nWatch brick and mortar fall like dripping water, ugh!\n(Good God)\n\nI'm gon' praise Him, praise Him till I'm gone\n(Good God)\nI'm gon' praise Him, praise Him till I'm gone\nWhen the praises go up,  (Good God) the blessings come down\n(The blessings come down)\nWhen the praises go up, the blessings come down\n(the blessings come down)\nWhen the praises go up, the blessings come down\n(Are you ready for your blessings?)\nWhen the praises go up, the blessings come down\n(Are you ready for your miracle?)\nWhen the praises go up, the blessings come down\n(Are you ready, are you ready?)\n(Are you ready, are you ready?)\n(Are you ready, are you ready?)\n(Are you ready, are you

blessings come down\nWhen the praises go up, the blessings come down\nIt seems like blessings keep falling in my lap\nIt seems like blessings keep falling in my lap\n\nI don't make songs for free, I make 'em for freedom\nDon't believe in kings, believe in the Kingdom\nChisel me into stone, prayer whistle me into song air\nDying laughing with Krillin saying something 'bout blonde hair\nJesus' black life ain't matter, I know I talked to his daddy\nSaid you the man of the house now, look out for your family\nHe has ordered my steps,  gave me a sword with a crest\nAnd gave Donnie a trumpet in case I get shortness of breath\n\nI'm gon' praise Him, praise Him 'til I'm gone\nDon't be mad\nI'm gon' praise Him, praise Him 'til I'm gone\nWhen the praises go up\n(Good God)\nThe blessings come down\nGood God\nWhen the praises go up (Good God) the blessings come down\n( the blessings come down)\nWhen the praises go up, the blessings come down\n(It seems like blessings keep falling in my lap)\nThe blessings come down\nWhen the praises go up, the blessings come down\n(Good God)\n\nThey booked the nicest hotels on the 59th floor\nWith the big wide windows, with the suicide doors\nAin't no blood on my money, ain't no Twitter in Heaven\nI know them drugs isn't close, ain't no visitin' Heaven\nI know the difference in blessings and worldly possessions\nLike my ex girl getting pregnant\nAnd her becoming my everything\nI'm at war with my wrongs, I'm writing four different songs\nI never forged it or forfeited, I'm a force to be reconciled\nThey want four minute songs\nYou need a four hour praise dance performed every morn\nI'm feeling shortness of breath, so Nico grab you a horn\nHit Jericho with a buzzer beater to end a quarter\nWatch brick and mortar fall like dripping water, ugh!\n(Good God)\n\nI'm gon' praise Him, praise Him till I'm gone\n(Good God)\nI'm gon' praise Him, praise Him till I'm gone\nWhen the praises go up,  (Good God) the blessings come down\n(The blessings come down)\nWhen the praises go up, the blessings come down\n(the blessings come down)\nWhen the praises go up, the blessings come down\n(Are you ready for your blessings?)\nWhen the praises go up, the blessings come down\n(Are you ready for your miracle?)\nWhen the praises go up, the blessings come down\n(Are you ready, are you ready?)\n(Are you ready, are you ready?)\n(Are

unfamiliar lessons from childhood\nMake you remember how to smile good\nI'm pre-currency, post-language, anti-label\nPro-famous, I'm Broadway Joe Namath\nKanye's best prodigy\nHe ain't signed me but he proud of me\nI got some ideas that you gotta see\nMake a vid with shawty and they ship it like the Odyssey\nThey never seen a rapper practice modesty\nI never practice, I only perform\nI don't even warn, I don't eat it warm, I won't be reborn\nI speak to God in public, I speak to God in public\nHe keep my rhymes in couplets\nHe think the new shit jam, I think we mutual fans\nI used to dance to Michael, I used to dance in high school\nI used to pass out music, I still pass out music\nThe people's champ must be everything the people can't be\nI'm getting artsy-fartsy, house full of some Hebru

water, standing still\nEndless fields of daffodils and chamomile\nRice under black beans\nWalked into Apple with cracked screens\nAnd told prophetic stories of freedom\nFound warmth in a Black queen for when I get cold\nLike Nat King, I'm doing the dad thing\nI speak of wondrous unfamiliar lessons from childhood\nMake you remember how to smile good\nI'm pre-currency, post-language, anti-label\nPro-famous, I'm Broadway Joe Namath\nKanye's best prodigy\nHe ain't signed me but he proud of me\nI got some ideas that you gotta see\nMake a vid with shawty and they ship it like the Odyssey\nThey never seen a rapper practice modesty\nI never practice, I only perform\nI don't even warn, I don't eat it warm, I won't be reborn\nI speak to God in public, I speak to God in public\nHe keep my rhymes in couplets\nHe think the new shit jam, I think we mutual fans\nI used to dance to Michael, I used to dance in high school\nI used to pass out music, I still pass out music\nThe people's champ must be everything the people can't be\nI'm getting artsy-fartsy, house full of some Hebru Brantleys\nYou must\u2019ve missed the come up, I must be all I can be\nCall me Mister Mufasa, I had to master stampedes\n\nI made it through, made it through, made it through\nAnd everything I gave to you, I gave to you, I gave to you\nYou got it, you got it, you got it, it's coming (Coming, coming, coming)\nSo are you ready?\nAre you ready?\n\nAre you ready for your blessings?\nAre you ready for your miracle?\nAre you ready for your blessings?\nAre you ready for your miracle?\nAre you ready for your blessings?\nAre you ready for your miracle?\nAre you ready for your blessings?\nAre you ready for your miracle?\nAre you ready for your blessings?\nAre you ready for your miracle?\nAre

hope they shake that jam\nIf they ever get caught let's hope they shake that jam\nShake that jam\n\nChance The Rapper, song singer, senior, bong steamer\nLight up hot wheels, locked up, wrong steamer\nDreamer, long Beemers, our neighbors their, lawns greener\nWe wrestle with envy then act up, John Cena\nChancellor Bennett, referred to as word chemist\nThe bourbon and slurred sentences is turning up burning bridges\nCigarette stained smile, all covered in sin\nMy big homie died young, just turned older than him\nGetting hyped up off them bad bitches on it\nGetting knocked up off a nigga, bad luck\nGetting scared now with them IRS audits\nAll the tax money that I didn\u2019t add up\nThat I didn\u2019t get yet, but they think that I got it\nKeep a long shirt so they think that I got it\nAnd if they all dummy and a nigga get bodied\nIt was really, really ill, I know a nigga held up\nHell yeah I\u2019ll always get a pic with y\u2019all niggas\nWord to my fans, all six of y'all niggas\nI seen all the tweets and the tips from y\u2019all niggas\nGot hands for them niggas that pick on y'all niggas\nLoving your love, an album to come\nI bet that you love it, comes out in a month\nChance, the astounding class clown\nThat turned out to amount into something, 3001\n\nI count my blessings too often\nMy best friends on one hand\nMy sheep when I\u2019m done here\nGotta get up, get up\nI count my blessings too often\nMy best friends on one hand\nMy sheep when I\u2019m done here\nGotta get up, get up\n\nKnock knock said the fist to the world\nShine sun through the mist and debris\nBang bang said the fist to the young\nSilence from the lips of the free\nSay something important, say something important\nMake money the end of the week\nBut that shit coming soon, I\u2019m getting hungry\nMight sell out in a couple of weeks\nBut my crib they buckin\u2019\nAnd they just called Buddy, that\u2019s lil bro\nEven though last time we spoke\nWe was arguing, but we still stay close\nAsk God to watch the squad\nOn God, battle niggas to the death, alright\nFuck your squad and the whole facade\nI ain\u2019t never scared of where a nigga reside\nExtra mild sauce on the side, extra mileage on the ride\nExpress, I'mma grab my chain\nCause it\u2019s extra violence all on the nine\nTen days, that\u2019s an awful lot\nEleven squares in like fifteen minutes\nSixteens when that album comes\nSpit twelve real quick for a listening picnic, igh!\n\nI count my blessings too often\nMy best friends on one hand\nMy sheep when I\u2019m done here\nGotta get up, get up\nI count my blessings too often\nMy best friends on one hand\nMy sheep when I\u2019m done here\nGotta get up, get up\n\nHeads bowed for the curly haired sons of Abraham\nDear father, guide all my

guide all my brothers away from Sam\nIf they ever get caught let's hope they shake that jam\nIf they ever get caught let's hope they shake that jam\nShake that jam\nHeads bowed for the curly haired sons of Abraham\nDear Father, guide all my brothers away from Sam\nIf they ever get caught let's hope they shake that jam\nIf they ever get caught let's hope they shake that jam\nShake that jam\n\nChance The Rapper, song singer, senior, bong steamer\nLight up hot wheels, locked up, wrong steamer\nDreamer, long Beemers, our neighbors their, lawns greener\nWe wrestle with envy then act up, John Cena\nChancellor Bennett, referred to as word chemist\nThe bourbon and slurred sentences is turning up burning bridges\nCigarette stained smile, all covered in sin\nMy big homie died young, just turned older than him\nGetting hyped up off them bad bitches on it\nGetting knocked up off a nigga, bad luck\nGetting scared now with them IRS audits\nAll the tax money that I didn\u2019t add up\nThat I didn\u2019t get yet, but they think that I got it\nKeep a long shirt so they think that I got it\nAnd if they all dummy and a nigga get bodied\nIt was really, really ill, I know a nigga held up\nHell yeah I\u2019ll always get a pic with y\u2019all niggas\nWord to my fans, all six of y'all niggas\nI seen all the tweets and the tips from y\u2019all niggas\nGot hands for them niggas that pick on y'all niggas\nLoving your love, an album to come\nI bet that you love it, comes out in a month\nChance, the astounding class clown\nThat turned out to amount into something, 3001\n\nI count my blessings too often\nMy best friends on one hand\nMy sheep when I\u2019m done here\nGotta get up, get up\nI count my blessings too often\nMy best friends on one hand\nMy sheep when I\u2019m done here\nGotta get up, get up\n\nKnock knock said the fist to the world\nShine sun through the mist and debris\nBang bang said the fist to the young\nSilence from the lips of the free\nSay something important, say something important\nMake money the end of the week\nBut that shit coming soon, I\u2019m getting hungry\nMight sell out in a couple of weeks\nBut my crib they buckin\u2019\nAnd they just called Buddy, that\u2019s lil bro\nEven though last time we spoke\nWe was arguing, but we still stay close\nAsk God to watch the squad\nOn God, battle niggas to the death, alright\nFuck your squad and the whole facade\nI ain\u2019t never scared of where a nigga reside\nExtra mild sauce on the side, extra mileage on the ride\nExpress, I'mma grab my chain\nCause it\u2019s extra violence all on the nine\nTen days, that\u2019s an awful lot\nEleven squares in like fifteen minutes\nSixteens when that album comes\nSpit twelve real quick for a listening picnic, igh!\n\nI count my blessings too often\nMy best friends on one hand\nMy sheep when I\u2019m done here\nGotta get up, get up\nI count my blessings too often\nMy best friends on one hand\nMy sheep when I\u2019m done here\nGotta get up, get up\n\nHeads bowed for the curly haired sons of Abraham\nDear father, guide all my brothers away from Sam\nIf they ever get caught let's hope they shake that jam\nIf they ever get caught let's hope they shake that jam\nShake that jam\nHeads bowed for the curly haired sons of Abraham\nDear father, guide all my brothers away from Sam\nIf they ever get caught let's hope they shake that jam\nIf they

Noodles\nRamadan, I\u2019m the don of the diamond jewels\nFond of finding a way to kindly tell these toddlers toodles\nI\u2019m a kamikaze and I\u2019m a kinda cuckoo\nI could write a fucking book, non kamasutral\nYou niggas goofies, it's a conflict that is kinda crucial\nCaught you on the 9 in all blue yelling I\u2019m a neutral\nBut I\u2019ma let the bull pass like matadors\nVersus a Minotaur, verse is a metaphor\nMetamorphoses and I\u2019ma fuckin animorph\nI used to go to school with Anna Fedele & Danny Whorf\nRemember I used to bang with the bad ones\n'Til my grandmama told on her grandson\nMama said that I was way too handsome\nTo be throwing the hand\u2019s son, breaking walls like Samson\nBut I\u2019ma throw a tantrum 'til I\u2019m on every Samsung\nSanyo and handheld and handgun\nPlease put ya lighter\u2019s up 'til life is up and light it up\nAnd slice a cut, the night is young, it\u2019s nice enough\nThe nicest blunt, the nicest stuff\nMy niggas out here trapping a

Who you got with you Chance?\n: This is Donnie Trumpet\n: Wassup everybody\n: I saw you tweet that out you said \"Breakfast Club with Donnie\" I said who the hell on this show is named Donnie\n: Donnie Trumpet whats up everybody\n: Lets start back who is chance because im familiar with you but ive never really heard a song, never heard a verse, so for someone like me who's not up on chance the rapper who are you?\n: Alright im the rapper, i'm from chicago. I'm 21\n: You're a rapper? I would've never guessed\n: Yeah yeah i'm the rapper, but im an artist of sorts and im from chicago, im for the people and i got 2 mixtapes\n: Acid Rap is one, that came out a couple years ago\n: That would be the one that you know\n: Right, the one before that..\n: 10 Day: You might know it you might not know it\n: Now explain the concept of 10 day\n: 10 day was recorded while i was on 10 day suspension from high school\n: What'd you do? why you get suspended?\n: I had marijuanna, i don't know what the rules are for FM radio. I'm just saying, I had weed, not really a lot of weed,but like on school property i guess\n: What like a half a zip, a zip?\n: Nah like maybe a quarter, maybe a quarter\n: ok were you selling or smoking?\n: I was smoking but they were tryna say i had intent to sell, but i didn't i had it in one bag it was for me. It doesn't matter\n: Did you tell them you were a user?\n: I wasn't really tryna say nothing to em. I didn't know what was incriminating and what was not, so i was chilling but they gave me the suspenion\n: Did somebody tell on you, because let me tell you something. When i was in high school, and I probably shouldn't say this-\n: That was a long time ago\n: -We used to get money when we used to tell on people for having weed\n: What? What kinda snitch-\n: Paid informant? Damn\n: So there were these like lame dudes I know, like what is he doing with weed? I would go tell on them id go to the principal and be like he got weed in his shoe\n: So you've always been like this\n: Because the lame dudes were tryna act cool and be like \"yo look i got weed i got a gun\" so we'd tell on them and get money\n: wow so you got gun charges for people and everything\n: that's messed up\n: So did somebody tell on you?\n: I hope not that would be crazy if i found out somebody told me that i think it was just the school was into what i was on and stuff so they kinda followed me around.The police officer that was issued to the school kinda randomly checked my lcoker and all types of stuff. And he was actually the one who found me. I was a little bit actually a couple blocks away from school cuz i went to school downtown. So i was in an alley somewhere and the dude just walked up on me grabbed me took me back to the school, made sure the kicked me outta school, then took me the station\n: So it was 10 days, and you did a mixtape in the library.

I would've never guessed\n: Yeah yeah i'm the rapper, but im an artist of sorts and im from chicago, im for the people and i got 2 mixtapes\n: Acid Rap is one, that came out a couple years ago\n: That would be the one that you know\n: Right, the one before that..\n: 10 Day: You might know it you might not know it\n: Now explain the concept of 10 day\n: 10 day was recorded while i was on 10 day suspension from high school\n: What'd you do? why you get suspended?\n: I had marijuanna, i don't know what the rules are for FM radio. I'm just saying, I had weed, not really a lot of weed,but like on school property i guess\n: What like a half a zip, a zip?\n: Nah like maybe a quarter, maybe a quarter\n: ok were you selling or smoking?\n: I was smoking but they were tryna say i had intent to sell, but i didn't i had it in one bag it was for me. It doesn't matter\n: Did you tell them you were a user?\n: I wasn't really tryna say nothing to em. I didn't know what was incriminating and what was not, so i was chilling but they gave me the suspenion\n: Did somebody tell on you, because let me tell you something. When i was in high school, and I probably shouldn't say this-\n: That was a long time ago\n: -We used to get money when we used to tell on people for having weed\n: What? What kinda snitch-\n: Paid informant? Damn\n: So there were these like lame dudes I know, like what is he doing with weed? I would go tell on them id go to the principal and be like he got weed in his shoe\n: So you've always been like this\n: Because the lame dudes were tryna act cool and be like \"yo look i got weed i got a gun\" so we'd tell on them and get money\n: wow so you got gun charges for people and everything\n: that's messed up\n: So did somebody tell on you?\n: I hope not that would be crazy if i found out somebody told me that i think it was just the school was into what i was on and stuff so they kinda followed me around.The police officer that was issued to the school kinda randomly checked my lcoker and all types of stuff. And he was actually the one who found me. I was a little bit actually a couple blocks away from school cuz i went to school downtown. So i was in an alley somewhere and the dude just walked up on me grabbed me took me back to the school, made sure the kicked me outta school, then took me the station\n: So it was 10 days, and you did a mixtape in the library.

LSD\nAsked Joseph about my deal\nHe looked back said \"hell yeah, let's eat!\"\nYoung Rascal Flatts - Young ass kid ass could rap\nFuck all the assholes, asterisk back\nI'm like a nazi not dead to be dad\nGratzi for all of the shots that we had\nThe shots that we had, i'm tryna take another fucking shot on the ave\nShoutsout the ave\nShouts to all my niggas from Chicago and Laramie\nLet em hear it if they haven't hear of me they scared of me\nIm outie IGH!\n\nI'm off the top like a confiscated hat\nThey took it back like we confiscating that\nCan i get it, wait i'm skating back\nDown the rail\nTell him if he's ever been to hell, holy grail\nThat all these niggas looking for\nI ain't looking forward to a magazine\nOr a cover of Forbes\nI don't need to afford\nA Ford car that I could ride through switch on the doors\nTurn up the locks because niggas be trying to rob you\nI don't really hear shit they trying to rock through\nThey trying to rock through the rock of gilbraltar\nI had to take the shit to the alter\nAnd alter my shit like control-alt-delete\nI know i'm hot in the streets\nAnd i'm hot with the tweets\nAnd i'm hot with the heat\nAnd i'm like the spurs vs the heat\nFirst verse, worse than me\nAnd everybody's wishing happy birthday\nLike wheres the candles\nAnd wheres that nigga chano?\nAnd wheres that nigga that eats like campbells\nCamp full of soup...\n\nYou a lame and your bitch break down my weed sometimes\nSee my face in the streets, in the tweets if you read sun times\nI be in the sun times if you read one time\nI hit it then i hit one time\nEvery time i drop a hit and niggas like it\nEverybody want to rap just like it\nAnd i know that my rap just might fix the game\nShoutsout to swane shoutsout to swayne\nLahni, ripping of the top i got a trumpet, Donnie\nShoutsout that nigga Nico\nI gotta meet those\nGirls that be giving me pesos and euros and lethos\nYou understand it if you write a few papers\nOff of the top i'm blowing vapors\nThrow it to my homie with the light saber\nCut it up quickly, Ripley's believe me\nI be getting off like this is my stop\nHeheheh a nigga might stop\nIf i hit enough hot bars in a row\nBut if not, i just might give and go\nGreen light, i got T like a nigga that have a cup of tea right in front of em\nI keep bumping em, damn they keep bumping em\nWalking through the streets like man we can't bump with em\nHaving fun with em\nShoutsout sway\nShoutsout everybody in the room today\nI'ma be back on the rap fix\nAnd now i gotta act like... an actress"}}, {"title": "Chance The Rapper's

pregnant she been showin' crack like bad mechanics\nI rub her feet, I put in work like I was Robyn Fenty\nThe only chick that I hold as much is probably Kinsley\nI sit with her and watch Black Ink and Being Mary\nBut never Love & Hip Hop, that shit get kinda scary\nShe stand about six feet, she used to hoop at 'Lane\nI tried to stick her the other day and got my ankle sprained\nI fell deep, tried to leave, but you know the way that you learn best\nIs leavin' out the garage and get hit with that U-turn text\nSo if you got a girl and she sexy and she grown\nStay your ass at home 'fore you end up all alone\nLeave the toilet seat down, always keep your phone\nAsk my BM, she got her own ringtone, and she was singing..."}}, {"title": "Chance The Rapper Vibin With Einer Bankz At Coachella",

coyote\nIf I sip any Henny, my belly just might be outie\nPull up inside a huggy, Starsky & Hutch a dougie\nI just opened up the pack in an hour I'll ash my lucky\nTonight she just yelling \"fuck

Cheese's pizzas, Jesus pieces, sing Jesus love me\nPut Visine inside my eyes so my grandma would fucking hug me\nOh generation above me, I know you still remember me\nMy afro look just like daddy's, y'all taught me how to go hunting (BLAM!)\n\nCigarettes on cigarettes, my mama think I stank\nI got burn holes in my hoodies, all my homies think it's dank\nI miss my cocoa butter kisses\nI miss my cocoa butter kisses\nCigarettes on cigarettes, my mama think I stank (Innanet)\nI got burn holes in my hoodies, all my homies think it's dank\nI miss my cocoa butter kisses\nI miss my cocoa butter kisses (Innanet)\n\nI will smoke a little something but I don't inhale\nEverywhere that I go, everywhere they be asking how's it going\nSay the going's well, go figure, Victor's light skinned\nJesus got me feeling like Colin Powell, all praise to the God\nGod knows he's a pro, he's a pro like COINTEL\nCheck, check mate, check me take me to the bedroom\nLike she know me well, I mean normally\nYou see Norma Jean wouldn't kick it with Farmer Phil\nBut these kids these days, they get so high\nBurn trees, smoke chlorophyll, 'til they can't feel shit\nShit-faced, faced it, 15 hits on this L\nElevated, train, and the craziest thing\nGot me feeling like Lauryn Hill, miseducated, my dick delegated\nRap Bill Bellamy, they said I shoulda never made it\nProbably shoulda been dead or in jail\nDeadbeat dad, enough of that jazz\nAsshole, absinthe up in that glass\nAre we there yet? Ice cubes in a bong\nRip, brain dead, take a tug and then pass\n\nI think we all addicted\nYeah, I think we all addicted\nReally though, I think we all addicted\nI think we all addicted\n\nCigarettes on cigarettes, my momma think I stank\nI got burn holes in my memories, my homies think it's dank\nI miss my cocoa butter kisses\nI think we all addicted\n\nCigarettes on cigarettes, my mama think I stank\nI got burn holes in my hoodies, all my homies think it's dank\nI miss my cocoa butter kisses\nI miss my cocoa butter kisses\n\nI could make a flow, pitter patter with a patter pitter - juicy\nUsed to be in a jalabiya and a kufi\nTrying hard not to be addicted to a groupie\nI ended up on an album cover in a Coogi\nYou see, I be still a God but a goofy\nYou be flowing about drugs and a Uzi\nThat's the new principle, sometimes I'mma be about some hoes\nSometimes I'mma wanna make a movie\nAnd when it come to rapping fast, I'm the Higgs Boson\nAnd though my style freakish\nI could still break your body down to five pieces like I did Voltron\n'Cause I'm addicted to the craft and I be off a OG\nKnow me, I'm the Obi-Wan Kenobi of the dope see\nNever scared of mean spirits, methamphetamine lyrics\nCooler like I'm offa codeine, low key\nDon't be so judgmental, even though I'm reminiscing\nIf I don't know what I miss is\nI'ma end up figuring out that it's home\nAnd my mother and my grandmother cocoa butter kisses\nThis is just a testament to the ones that raised me\nThe ones that I praise and I'm thanking\nI need 'em but the chronic all up in my clothes\nAnd I wanna get a hug, and I can't 'cause I'm stanking\nNever too old for a spanking, IGH!\n\nCigarettes on cigarettes, my momma think I stank\nI got burn holes in my memories, my homies think it's dank\nI miss my cocoa butter kisses\nI think we all addicted\n\nCigarettes on cigarettes, my mama think I stank\nI got burn holes in my hoodies, all my homies think it's dank\nI miss my cocoa butter kisses\nI miss my cocoa butter kisses\nCigarettes on cigarettes, my mama think I stank\nI got burn holes in my hoodies, all my homies think it's dank\nI miss my cocoa butter kisses\nI miss my cocoa butter kisses"}}, {"title": "Cold Stares (Ish Illa)", "album": null, "year": null, "lyrics": "EDIT: The song has been officially released - check the lyrics out here\nHey Genius family\nVia Twitter, Chance expressed his desire to keep this song hidden from the public.

ain't slept since I graduated\nI'm so tired of this school shit\nNiggas talking all that glad you made it\nI'm getting tired of the bullshit\nPosted like facebook walls\nAsk me if I care how her face look, naw\nSnap back to reality, back pack and a snapple\nWe so far from moving jeans and backpacks from the mall\nAnd Chance laughing em off, hand smackin em all xanax in a ball\nShoulda said lean but the lean put on the house if the track buy me a couch\nNo back pack in the fall, no plan back for me to fall\nNo man left for me to ball up\nIt's too risky, it's just a mistake\nSo crispy, is that a mixtape? Is that an album? Shutup\n\n\nFor your spot, for your top\nI'm off of mine\nI'm off the line, sometimes you thought I wrote it\nI did, no that's bogus I'm lying but I'm focused like a ford\nCan you afford? A verse from the man of the yord? Of the year?\nNext it's New York next it's back to Cali, shouts to Dally Auston\nI do this often, and shouts to Austin the video's awesome\nThey wanna know more, they wanna know why but he flossing\nNow you know I'm lying now you know I'm offing eat em up lunch em\nIf you fuck up better punch em' is that still a freestyle?\nIDK I eat cake, I still cake, with my bitch\nRipping off the top, throw up the fists for niggas that still rapping that bitch\nAttack shit all and stack shit, it's still so fun to play in my car\n\nI'm coming for your spot, bitch\nI don't give a fuck about you or any of your shit that you...\nI'm coming for your spot"}}, {"title": "D.R.A.M.

up the new shit (The shit)\nToss this in the deck so niggas can catch rep\n\nWhat's good good? And what's good evil?\nAnd what's good, gangstas? And what's good, people?\nAnd why's God's phone die every time that I call on Him?\nIf his son had a Twitter wonder if I would follow Him\nSwallow them synonyms like cinnamon Cinnabon\nKeep all them sentiments down to a minimum\nStudious Gluteus Maxim models is sending him\nPics of they genitalia, tallied up ten of 'em\nI slurped too many pain-kills down, I'm off a lot\nI got a lot off days, but it ain't often that I'm off the clock\nYa kna wha mean, I got the Chicago Blues\nWe invented rock before the Stones got through\nWe just aiming back 'cause the cops shot you\nBuck buck bang bang, yelling \"Fuck Fox News!\"\nBooyaka buckle up, mothafuck opps too\nAin't no knuckling up 'em young 'cause it just not cool\n\nNice to see you Father New Year\nMiddle finger Uncle Samuel\nShooting death with weighted dice\nAnd hitting stains on birthday candles\nI know somebody, somebody loves my ass\n'Cause they help me beat my demon's ass\n\nEverybody's somebody's everything\nI know you right\nNobody's nothing\nThat's right\nEverybody's somebody's everything\nI know you right\nNobody's nothing\nThat's right\nEverybody's somebody's everything\nI know you right\nNobody's nothing\nThat's right\n\nRight? IGH\nI used to tell hoes I was dark light or off white\nBut I'd fight if a nigga said that I talk white\nAnd both my parents was black\nBut they saw it fit that I talk right\nWith my drawers hid but\nMy hard head stayed in the clouds like a lost kite\nBut gravity had me up in a submission hold\nLike I'm dancing with the Devil with two left feet and I'm pigeon toed\nIn two small point ballet shoes with a missing sole\nAnd two missing toes\nBut it's love like Cupid kissing a mistletoe\n\nNice to see you Father New Year\nMiddle finger Uncle Samuel\nShooting death with weighted dice\nAnd hitting stains on birthday candles\nI know somebody, somebody loves my ass\n'Cause they help me beat my demons ass\n\nLike Cassius ducking the draft and now the fight is over\nThe type to love from a distance not the type that told her\nSpent three days on the rap, trash it and type it over\nWith babies on the block under arms like fighting odors\nCoppers and quotas\nHold ya head like 2Pac had taught\nObviously they are on a come up\nWith better chances tobogganing in the fucking summer\nConcoctions for the bad days and a condom for the good ones\nAll odds against us we tryna get lucky\nDoper than Lucky\nYou're ending happy, that's only a tugging\nLike Satan masturbating shit come hot\nBut y'all still love me ugh\nHow father time a deadbeat\nMaybe I'm adopted\nThat'll explain why all of my shit been so timeless, IGH\n\nEverybody's somebody's everything\nI know you right\nNobody's nothing\nThat's right\nEverybody's somebody's everything\nI know you right\nNobody's

And what's good, people?\nAnd why's God's phone die every time that I call on Him?\nIf his son had a Twitter wonder if I would follow Him\nSwallow them synonyms like cinnamon Cinnabon\nKeep all them sentiments down to a minimum\nStudious Gluteus Maxim models is sending him\nPics of they genitalia, tallied up ten of 'em\nI slurped too many pain-kills down, I'm off a lot\nI got a lot off days, but it ain't often that I'm off the clock\nYa kna wha mean, I got the Chicago Blues\nWe invented rock before the Stones got through\nWe just aiming back 'cause the cops shot you\nBuck buck bang bang, yelling \"Fuck Fox News!\"\nBooyaka buckle up, mothafuck opps too\nAin't no knuckling up 'em young 'cause it just not cool\n\nNice to see you Father New Year\nMiddle finger Uncle Samuel\nShooting death with weighted dice\nAnd hitting stains on birthday candles\nI know somebody, somebody loves my ass\n'Cause they help me beat my demon's ass\n\nEverybody's somebody's everything\nI know you right\nNobody's nothing\nThat's right\nEverybody's somebody's everything\nI know you right\nNobody's nothing\nThat's right\nEverybody's somebody's everything\nI know you right\nNobody's nothing\nThat's right\n\nRight?

I uh-\nKen: No, no, no, no. I told ya, I know you need it now, so next week I promise you I'll have you hooked up, ok?\nChance: Oh, alright. I just wanted to say thank you for everything. For the computer, the T-Shirts, and all the other stuff\nKen: You know, Chance. Let me tell you something. You know, I could never be more proud of anything in my life, you know, than I am of you and what you've done. Chance, you have done remarkable and wondrous things, so you don't have to tell me thank you for anything. I'm supposed to do this, that stuff for you anyway, and ya know, just keep doing what you're doing. I am very, very proud of you. Just keep doing what you're doing, ok?\nChance: Thank you, love you\nKen: Alright, son. Love you too, take care\nChance: Bye bye\nThanks for coming guys\n\n'Member sittin' in class the first time listening to Dilla\nEverything's good\nRubbin' on yo chin, sippin gin, Margiela brand chinchilla\nEverything's good\nMy manager backpack packed with packs of cigarillos\nAnd some fruit snacks, and some killers\nPhone numbers on speed dial call them save monkey guerillas\nEverything's good\nI ain't really that good at goodbyes\nI ain't really that bad at leaving\nI ain't really always been a good guy, I used to be thirsty thievin'\nRunnin through purses, even persons leave 'em hurtin' bleedin\nI ain't really help the helpless\nI used to be worse than worthless\nNow I'm worth hooks and verses\nI'm good like books in churches\nHarolds and Hooks and Churches\nEverything's Good\nSee my name when you Google search it\nUse a card when I make a purchase\nEverything's Good\nBut I knew I was fly when I was just a caterpillar\nThat I'd make it even if I never make a milla\nWhen I meet my maker he gon' make sure that we chillin'\nAnd everything's good\nI ain't really that good at goodnight, I ain't really that bad at sleepin'\nWith bad bitches, put them aside, I used to be thirsty creeping\nNow I'm out working evenings, birthdays, even Tuesdays\nWednesdays, Thursdays, weekends, rehearsing verses, murdering merch and events\nDamn it feel good to be a gangsta\nAnd it feel good for me to thank you\nPut money back in your bank account\nOff of songs I barely could think up\n'Cause a lot of songs niggas gon' make up\nMake sense, but they never gon' make a sound\nAnd I'm better than I was the last time, crescendo\nThanks Justin, lending them pencils\nMr. Menzies, Mensa, Chris Minto\nThe time I beat Chris on Nintendo\nNanana hey hey, good intro\nRemember jacket shoppin' after listening to Thriller\nRemember the first time you heard this through and thought, \"damn that's that nigga.\"\nEverything's good"}}, {"title": "Family", "album":

likes my raps cause it sounds good\nTold me not to cut corners, use to cut quarters\nSitting in the room, on the phone, cooking up orders\nTill my pops popped me off, that was family matters\nUsed to watch him in the kitchen sipping Sammy Adams\nNow I'm rollin', iPhone Stolen\nMama whip with 5 of my guys, 4 holdin'\nTrying to live our lives like our lives are so golden\nGot big shoes to fill like try go bowling\nTil we strike out, we just hoping we don't strike out\n4th quarter, how you gon go and take Mike out?\nSummertime Chi, I had to pull the bike out\nRiding getting nice cause it's nice out\n\nLet's land in the land where the Famo stay\nGrind all day til the fam okay\nIt still warm my heart to hear my grandma pray\nFor the fam of my friends when my mans go away (x2)\n\nDon't wake up, don't wake up, don't wake up too fast\nDon't make up your mind, you should flake on that class\nSing all you want, just don't Drake on they ass\nShore you got drive, don't turn fake on they ass\nGood morning, good raps, good morrow, good luck\nTonight you could blow, tomorrow you suck\nBizarro, my carro, I borrowed from Chuck\nA new SLR and Ferrarro deluxe\nNo money for the meter when I'm parkin' em\nGassed than a bitch no car with him\nMarket him, tell him that he's buzzing like a game of operation with Parkinsons\nYoung kid rappers, kidnappers\nYoung whipper snapper that will whip past ya\nWill get at you, come get at you\nWanna break ya off, Come Kit-Kat you\n\n\nNow the team work make the dream work\nGo ahead and send an application if you need work\nIf it need hurt, then I'mma bring hurt\nHow you finna see the clouds if you never seen dirt\nNow you finna play it loud, listen how it's goin down\nDidn't know the name before bet you niggas know it now\nChi-City niggy, made a 50 out a penny\nGot some titties at the cribby and the Savemoney with me and we going in\nGoing all out for them hoes again\nNow I'm fin to bring the fucking flow and bend it back\nAnd show it's more to this than rap\nLove my parents for supporting cause they know I'm finna crack\nKnow my niggas got my back, got some niggas selling packs\nBut I'm tryin' to get em cheese so I can get em out the trap\nNow my figures getting fat, a lot of hoes be tryin' to jack\nBut I got her on my lap, All she do is make it clap", "image":

good\nMy sister said she likes my raps cause it sounds good\nTold me not to cut corners, use to cut quarters\nSitting in the room, on the phone, cooking up orders\nTill my pops popped me off, that was family matters\nUsed to watch him in the kitchen sipping Sammy Adams\nNow I'm rollin', iPhone Stolen\nMama whip with 5 of my guys, 4 holdin'\nTrying to live our lives like our lives are so golden\nGot big shoes to fill like try go bowling\nTil we strike out, we just hoping we don't strike out\n4th quarter, how you gon go and take Mike out?\nSummertime Chi, I had to pull the bike out\nRiding getting nice cause it's nice out\n\nLet's land in the land where the Famo stay\nGrind all day til the fam okay\nIt still warm my heart to hear my grandma pray\nFor the fam of my friends when my mans go away (x2)\n\nDon't wake up, don't wake up, don't wake up too fast\nDon't make up your mind, you should flake on that class\nSing all you want, just don't Drake on they ass\nShore you got drive, don't turn fake on they ass\nGood morning, good raps, good morrow, good luck\nTonight you could blow, tomorrow you suck\nBizarro, my carro, I borrowed from Chuck\nA new SLR and Ferrarro deluxe\nNo money for the meter when I'm parkin' em\nGassed than a bitch no car with him\nMarket him, tell him that he's buzzing like a game of operation with Parkinsons\nYoung kid rappers, kidnappers\nYoung whipper snapper that will whip past ya\nWill get at you, come get at you\nWanna break ya off, Come Kit-Kat you\n\n\nNow the team work make the dream work\nGo ahead and send an application if you need work\nIf it need hurt, then I'mma bring hurt\nHow you finna see the clouds if you never seen dirt\nNow you finna play it loud, listen how it's goin down\nDidn't know the name before bet you niggas know it now\nChi-City niggy, made a 50 out a penny\nGot some titties at the cribby and the Savemoney with me and we going in\nGoing all out for them hoes again\nNow I'm fin to bring the fucking flow and bend it back\nAnd show it's more to this than rap\nLove my parents for supporting cause they know I'm finna crack\nKnow my niggas got my back, got some niggas selling packs\nBut I'm tryin' to get em cheese so I can get em out the trap\nNow my figures getting fat, a lot of hoes be tryin' to jack\nBut I got her on my lap, All she do is make it clap"}}, {"title": "Family Matters", "album": null, "year":

that glitters is not gold\nAll, all, all, and all gold is not reality\nReal is what you lays on me\nHow's everybody doing?\n\nWe were all that matters, family's all that matters\nThis is just business, see you right after\nNothing comes before ya, nothing else matters\nAll of this is for ya, you are all that matters\n\nI dance around the darkness down on Billie Jean Road\nIf I ain\u2019t toured then we still\u2019d be broke\nThought I got the formula, bon appetite\nI got a beat in case my baby baba ever leak\nWise beyond my years but way behind my peak\nYou gotta eat, this a step to my princess\nPoint of interest, fourth and inches\nHallelujah, the kid grew up, the crowd cheered the child\nBooya, mic drop, I walk home\n\nI don't care about, they don't mean a thing (All, all)\nAll these fancy things (All, all)\nI'll tell you that all, my weight in gold (All)\nAll I know, I know (And all gold is not reality)\nAll these things\nAll these things\nAll these things\nAll these things\n\nIn this part of my life, I'm growing up and I- and I wanna, I wanna do this the right way, go, go out of it, grow out of it, in the best way possible, so thank you guys who's been there thus far, and it's only gonna get better...\n\nI don't care bout, they don't mean a thing\nAll these fancy things\nI'll tell you that all, my weight in gold (All that glitters, glitters)\nAll I know, I know (Is not gold, Igh!)\nAll these things (All that matters)\nAll these things (All, all that matters)\nAll these things (You are all that matters)"}}, {"title": "Family Matters Tour Dates", "album":

that Laffy Taffy, jolly raunchy rapper\nDang, dang, dang - skeet, skeet, skeet\nShe do that thing for three retweets\nThe album feel like '92\nNow take that ball 'fore he three-peat\nChance, ho, acid, cruising on that LSD\nAsked Joseph about my deal\nHe looked back said \"hell yeah, let's eat!\"\n\nThis shit my favorite song, you just don't know the words\nBut I still fuck with you, you just ain't

pack on hands\nWith young Cletus to pat my back\nReal nigga with a nose ring, that's right\nJust here to rap them songs\nRag on my hair, wrap weed in Vegas, rockin' Vagabonds\nSang a song, oh you

the things you said to me\nWho is this that got you all gassed up?\nChangin' your opinions on me\nI was only gone for the last two months\nBut you don't have the time to wait on me\n\nI tried with you\nThere's more to life than sleeping in and getting high with you\nI had to let go of us to show myself what I can do\nBut that just didn't sit right with you\nAnd now you're tryna make me feel a way, on purpose\nNow you're throwing it back in my face, on purpose\nNow you're throwing dirt on my name, on purpose\nAnd you don't feel no way, you think I deserve it\n\nFeel a way, feel a way, feel a way\nI've stopped listenin' to things you say\nCause you don't mean them anyway\nFeel a way, feel a way, feel a way\nMaybe we just should have did things my way\nInstead of the other way\n\nWe need to breathe\nThere's more to life than hearing stuff and being mean to me\nWe had to let go of us to show ourselves what we can be\nBut that just didn't sit well with me\nTryna make me feel a way, on purpose\nThrowing dirt on my name, in public\nYou don't feel no way, on purpose\nI'm messing up all of Drake's words, on purpose.. careful\nCareful\nBe careful\nBe careful\nYou could never be too careful\n(I'm not a singer but BBC got me up very early in the morning)\n\nKeep ya head away from windows\nKeep your arms inside the ride\nTrust me with ya body, trust me with ya life\nBanging on the windows, baby come inside\nCertainly in trouble, maybe you should hide\nI'mma tell you like\nDon't you look up to me, don't trust a word I say\nDon't you end up like me, if you learn one thing today\nDon't you look up to me, don't trust a word I say\nDon't you end up like me, if you learn one thing today\n\nFeel a way, feel a way, young nigga feel a way\nMaybe we just should have did things this way\nInstead of the other way\nInstead of the other way\nFeel a way, feel a way, young parents feel this way\nMaybe we just should have did things this way\nInstead of the other way\nInstead of the other way\n...Social Experiment"}}, {"title": "Finish Line / Drown", "album": "Coloring Book", "year": "2016-05-12", "lyrics": "Part 1: Finish

back, and we back\nDo-do-do-do-do-do-do\nDo-do-do-do-do-do-do\nDo-do-do-do-do-do-do\nDo-do-do-do-do\nAnd we back, and we back, and we back\n\nThey ain't teaching taxes in school\nIt don't even matter, I was acting a fool\nBut who would think the raps would turn into racks?\nDon't matter, matter fact, it could happen to you\nScars on my head, I'm the boy who lived\nThe boy love playing when the boy too sick\nReclining on a prayer, I'm declining to help\nI've been lying to my body can't rely on myself oh no\nLast year got addicted to Xans\nStarted forgetting my name and started missing my chance\nL.A. for four months, end up leaving right back\nI'm in love with my city, bitch I sleep in my hat\nI felt hogtied ever since my dog died\nHe lived to 84, damn, that's a long ride\nI know he up there he just sit and he wait\nI'll be racing up the stairs I'mma get to the gate singing\n\nDo-do-do-do-do-do-do\nDo-do-do-do-do-do-do\nDo-do-do-do-do-do-do\nDo-do-do-do-do\nDo-do-do-do-do-do-do\nDo-do-do-do-do-do-do\nDo-do-do-do-do-do-do\nDo-do-do-do-do\n\nOh!

about stone mattresses, thin blankets\nReally long winters spent in a windbreaker\nI'm a temptation door-knocker, down there on Lower Wacker\nI'm a rich excuse for a father, you just can't tour a toddler\nShe turnin' 2, she don't need diapers, she just need her papa\nI really need a break, could really use a nap\nMy daughter barely recognize me when I lose the hat\nYou go so far, you hit a point where you can't Uber back\nThe other day, I told a hummingbird he too relaxed\nI did my worst, I did the work, I had to skip the label\nI go to church, they want a flick, I want to flip the table\nI knew the worth before the birth when it was just a stable\nAnd now it's just a fable, and it's just as fatal\n\nFirst world problems that niggas make up\nHave a dream and then never wake up\nWhen so much turns to too much\nHave a dream and then never wake up\n\nThe day is on its way, it couldn't wait no more\nHere it comes, here it comes, yeah\nReady or not, ready or not\nThe day is on its way, it couldn't wait no more\nHere it comes, here it comes\nReady or not, here it comes\n\nHere it comes\nAlright\nSpirit's working now\n\nI think my little cousins want they cousin back\nThe automatic quarterback that doesn't rap\nThey know I used to drive to Hammond for the Roman candles\nLied about coming back, the last straw that broke the camel\nIt ain't really fun to hang out with me no more\nWe can't go to River East to hang at the beach no more\nIt's messed up, I made it this way, and my feet so sore\nBut it's all downhill from here, I could teach snowboards\nI miss my mom, I miss my time, I miss my prime\nIn high school, I missed my prom, I ditched my date, I missed my beat\nKissed my teeth, kicked my feet, hooped and hollered\nNow I just sip my tea, sit my ass on my ass\nSend my tweet, fold my arms, twist my weed\nIf I hadn't heard the news, I would've known what he say\nBut the recliner on my chair is like an emergency brake, you know\n\nFirst world problems that niggas make up\nHave a dream and then never wake up\nWhen so much turns to too much\nHave a dream and then never wake up\n\nThe day is on its way, it couldn't wait no more\nHere it comes, here it comes\nReady or not, ready or not\nThe day is on its way, it couldn't wait no more\nHere it comes\nReady or not, here it comes\n\nThree verses, hell yes\nI still ain't get my Grammys in the mail yet\nI just want my mama happy like a toy sale\nAnd to stay connected to the world like a long-ass voicemail\nI hear the seams snappin', and I'm the team captain\nNo more knee slappin' or shoe shinin' or shoe signin'\n'Til the dream happens, I'm just gon' keep rappin'\nAnd y'all just keep clappin' and keep actin' like\nFlint got clean water and y'all don't got teen daughters\nAnd black friends and gay cousins, y'all just gon' say nothin'\nKnow that the day comin', knees bowed, tongues confessin'\nThe last ones gettin' first dibs on blessings\n\nNow these the first world problems that niggas make up\nKeep on playin', we gon' shake this shit up\nKeep on tellin' us we makin' it up\nThe American Dream, may you never wake up\n\nThe day is on its way, it couldn't wait no more\nHere it comes,  ready or not, ready or not\nReady or not,  ready or not, ready or not\nThe day is on its way, it will not wait another day\nNo more, no more (it's on its way, way, yeah)\nThe day is on its way, I cannot wait, here it's to stay\nNo more, no more (it won't wait, yeah)\nThe day is on its way, it couldn't wait no more\nHere it is"}}, {"title": "For Marah, Juke Jam", "album": null, "year":

plot\nI am not royalty or giant, just a boy with a rock\nEmployer of lawyers, boy oh boy, it ain't no boy in me, ma\nThe work is over, you should sit back and enjoy your seat, ma\nI'm buyin' groceries and toys and baby toilet seats, ma\nI'm s'posed to teach 'em and feed 'em and give 'em help when they're readin'\nAnd give 'em hugs after beatings and give 'em love after love\nI'm Hallmark and Walmart just for you\nAnd if it fall apart or it's all dark, I'm a wall charger or a call card\nOr a cab co, or a golf cart just for you\nWe a ballpark, just the two\nYou're a Gamestop, I'm a Paul Blart, just not two\nThinkin' back on my rap shit, my mini afro black shit\nThat na-na-na-na bo squad got my back shit\nNathan, Peter, Nico on my tracks shit"}}, {"title": "Home Studio (Back Up In

like leaves in the autumn\nDidn't think you would get on, get gone, and just out 'em\nDoubt them and reroute them, not count 'em\nI'd never leave you for the chance of an album\nYour roots stay

qualify a spot on His side\nI cannot modify or ratify, my momma made me apple pies\nLullabies and alibis, the book don't end with Malachi\nDevil will win employee of the month by the dozen\n'Til one score and three years from the third when he doesn't\nMy village raised 'em a child, come through the crib and it's bustin'\nYou meet anyone from my city, they gon' say that we cousins\nShabach barak, edify\nElectrify the enemy like Hedwig till he petrified\nAny petty Peter Petigrew could get the pesticide, 79th, 79th\nI don't believe in science, I believe in signs\nDon't believe in signing, I seen dollar signs, color white collar crime\nGood God, the gift of freedom\nHosanna Santa invoked and woke up slaves from Southampton to Chatham Manor\nMy dream girl's behind me, feel like I'm James Early\nThe type of worship make Jesus come back a day early\nWith the faith of a pumpkin-seed-sized mustard seed\nHear, for I will speak noble things as entrusted me\nOnly righteous, I might just shrug at the skullduggery\nI couldn't stand to see another rapper lose custody\nExalt, exalt, glorify, descend upon the earth with swords\nAnd fortify the borders where your shortage lie\nI used to hide from God, ducked down in the slums like \"shhh\"\n\nI was lost in the jungle like Simba\nAfter the death of Mufasa, no hog, no meerkat\nHakuna matata by day\nBut I spent my night time fighting tears back\nI prayed and prayed and left messages\nBut never got no hear back, or so it seemed\nA mustard seed was all I needed to sow a dream\nI build the ark to gently, gently\nRow my boat down Noah's stream\nSometimes the path I took to reach\nMy petty goals was so extreme\nI was so far down in the mud\nCouldn't even let my light shine\nBut you was always there\nWhen I needed to phone a friend or use a life line\nFrom a lofty height we wage war\nOn the poltergeist with the exalted Christ\nSpark the dark with the pulse of light\nStrike a corpse with a pulse of life\nI spit on the Tidal, it's tidal waves\nI spit on the Apple and kill a worm\nA fire in Cali will swallow a valley\nFor every African village burned\nJay Elect would've never made it\nO' son of man, O' son of man\nWho was the angel in Revelations\nWith a foot on water and a foot on land?\nWho was the angel that rode a Harley\nFrom the project to the house of Parliament\nAnd opened the book in the Devil's chamber\nAnd put the true name of the Lord in it?\nOld Jerusalem, New Jerusalem\nComes like this beast with a ball of fire\nThey poisoned the scriptures\nAnd gave us the pictures of false messiahs, it was all a lie\nMystery babylon, tumbling down\nSatan's establishment crumbling down\nThis is the year that I come for the crown\nBury my enemies under the ground", "image":

best thing that the world has to offer\n\nMagnify, magnify, lift it on high\nSpit a Spotify to qualify a spot on His side\nI cannot modify or ratify, my momma made me apple pies\nLullabies and alibis, the book don't end with Malachi\nDevil will win employee of the month by the dozen\n'Til one score and three years from the third when he doesn't\nMy village raised 'em a child, come through the crib and it's bustin'\nYou meet anyone from my city, they gon' say that we cousins\nShabach barak, edify\nElectrify the enemy like Hedwig till he petrified\nAny petty Peter Petigrew could get the pesticide, 79th, 79th\nI don't believe in science, I believe in signs\nDon't believe in signing, I seen dollar signs, color white collar crime\nGood God, the gift of freedom\nHosanna Santa invoked and woke up slaves from Southampton to Chatham Manor\nMy dream girl's behind me, feel like I'm James Early\nThe type of worship make Jesus come back a day early\nWith the faith of a pumpkin-seed-sized mustard seed\nHear, for I will speak noble things as entrusted me\nOnly righteous, I might just shrug at the skullduggery\nI couldn't stand to see another rapper lose custody\nExalt, exalt, glorify, descend upon the earth with swords\nAnd fortify the borders where your shortage lie\nI used to hide from God, ducked down in the slums like \"shhh\"\n\nI was lost in the jungle like Simba\nAfter the death of Mufasa, no hog, no meerkat\nHakuna matata by day\nBut I spent my night time fighting tears back\nI prayed and prayed and left messages\nBut never got no hear back, or so it seemed\nA mustard seed was all I needed to sow a dream\nI build the ark to gently, gently\nRow my boat down Noah's stream\nSometimes the path I took to reach\nMy petty goals was so extreme\nI was so far down in the mud\nCouldn't even let my light shine\nBut you was always there\nWhen I needed to phone a friend or use a life line\nFrom a lofty height we wage war\nOn the poltergeist with the exalted Christ\nSpark the dark with the pulse of light\nStrike a corpse with a pulse of life\nI spit on the Tidal, it's tidal waves\nI spit on the Apple and kill a worm\nA fire in Cali will swallow a valley\nFor every African village burned\nJay Elect would've never made it\nO' son of man, O' son of man\nWho was the angel in Revelations\nWith a foot on water and a foot on land?\nWho was the angel that rode a Harley\nFrom the project to the house of Parliament\nAnd opened the book in the Devil's chamber\nAnd put the true name of the Lord in it?\nOld Jerusalem, New Jerusalem\nComes like this beast with a ball of fire\nThey poisoned the scriptures\nAnd gave us the pictures of false messiahs, it was all a lie\nMystery babylon, tumbling down\nSatan's establishment crumbling down\nThis is the year that I come for the crown\nBury my enemies under the ground"}}, {"title": "I Ain't Word", "album": null, "year": "2012-10-11", "lyrics": "You can look me in my face\nI ain't got no worries (I ain\u2019t

the club\nIs the first caveman pops with his son, ball and a club\nWhat's better than paper is ballin' it up\nWhat's better than followers is actually fallin' in love\nWhat's better than frolicking, follies, fallin' in mud\nRolling in green pastures, wanderin', followin' love\nWhat's better than eating is feeding your fam\nWhat's better than meetings is missing meetings to meet with your fam\nWhat's better than leaning and needing a Xan\nIs hitting your zan dreaming a dream could mean leaving the land\nWhat's better than yelling is hollerin' love\nWhat's better than rhymes, nickels, dimes and dollars and dubs\nIs dialing up your darling just for callin' her up\nIt ain't nothing better than fallin' in love\nIGH!\n\nI've seen it come back, back, back and forth\nYou hit the nail right on top of the head\nI know you've seen it all before\nBut when it looks you in the eyes, it ain't nothin' you could say but \"that's love\"\nThat's love\nThat's love\nThat's love\nSay that's love, ooh ooh\nThat's lo-o-ove\nThat's love\nThat's love, that's love, that's love\nI LOVE you! (Love you)\nI LOVE you! (Lo-o-ove!)\nI LOVE you! (Love you)\nI LOVE you! (Lo-o-ove!)\nI LOVE you! (Love you)\nI LOVE you! (Lo-o-ove!)\nI LOVE you! (Love you)\nI LOVE you! (Lo-o-ove!)\nI LOVE you!\nThat's love\nThat's loooo-o-o-ove, that's love\nSay that's love, ooh, ooh, that's love\nThat's love, that's love, that's love, that's love"}}, {"title": "Internet Explorer",

yo?\nTrust me being fresh, it opens new windows\nI'm always fresh and I'm always stuntin'\nYou're pissed cause I'm fresher than the F5 button\nI'm dressed fresh, at the click of a start\nAfter this song I'mma add a few Grammys to my cart\nWoah\n\nDon't do me I'm an Internet Explorer, Internet Explorer, Internet Explorer\nDon't do me I'm an Internet Explorer\n\nHey yo I'm straight off the Netscape\nHead to the internet\nLog on MySpace, ask the where the women at?\nI guess I'm just that type of dude\nWhen I'm at the rest you can catch me on the web like spider food\nA pair a nike shoes, nice and new\nI got it cuffin' and you other niggas feet bare, like blue\nPretty girls, I keep 'em in bed like the flu\nYou niggas following, instead we write the rules\nSayin' Mac's 90, and infrared like Sniper 2s\nInside the booth you're recyclin'\nIt's proof that you dudes can't handle, like unicycles\nWe fantasy ballin' I'm using Michael\nAnd I can't even call it, but if I had to choose a title\nI'd say don't do me I'm an internet explorer\n\nDon't do me I'm an Internet Explorer, Internet Explorer, Internet Explorer\nDon't do me I'm an Internet Explorer"}}, {"title": "Israel (Sparring)", "album": null, "year": "2015-08-12", "lyrics": "Sparring is training\nChain snatching the slaves\nBut a rap song is a match in a cave\nDim lit, wet wick, wicked wrath in its way\nDrunk off of light, lies, laughing\nClaiming asylum while shying in shade\nI can't stay silent, I go violent when my violets is gray\nAnd my roses is black\nFuck the pharaohs and pharisees, Moses is back\nI don't need to see a Sphinx to know they noses was black\nI don't know one temptation that had Otis' back\nSparring is training this a jumping jack\nI'm the scariest jack in the pumpkin patch\nFloat like my jumper wet, sting like a bumblebee\nI swing like a lumber jack, go back when I'm up at bat\nThey tried to label me a non-rapper\nI'm an independent contractor\nCard cracker, sparring is training without the training wheels\nYou made it, you made it, you made it, yeah, you made a deal\nYou played it straight, hated, graduated, waited, waited\nYou still a waiter still\nMice will always find out ways to steal\nPicture me, fifth of Hennessy and the swisher sweet\nFake identity, 'til a plug named Trinity shook me\n\"Wake up, wake up\" like remember me?\nSaid one plus one make three, and you finna see\nYou ain't as grown as you finna be\nYou got them young nigga tendencies\n\nSentimental energy\nI let the light in beside him, I stand like angel\nSparring is training for an apathetic halo\nApologetic, non religious, consequential fable\nLike good is good, the love in me is goodly or godly\nThe Bible say mistakes is necessary\nSo I Mississippi monologue to granny house\nMy soloist is sold out to attentive God\nCornbread on my table when I say my prayers\nOn airs, to stairs where shadiness is time to rest or manifest\nSparring is training, I know they think me bumblebee\nAfro-Americano Sunny D\nBut bet I sting, no die\n\nSparring is training\n\nJacob wrestled with God, in the desert 'til he broke him\nAnd he blessed him and he rescued his heart\nI struggle with love, I juggle my loves\nI cuddle and coddle, ship wreckin' bottle, I huddle in hugs\nSparring is training bra, Ramses watching raining frogs\nJigga watching Damon, Damon watching Wayans Bros\nA tandem unicycle with two pilots in different maps\n\nYou giving back?\n(I'm giving back)\nTit for tat\n\nSynagogue and bottle caps\nA body in the underpass says, where's my Jesus?\nPledge allegiance to the money now\nWe runnin down to kiddie parks where darker kids be casualty\nLike come with me, to the museum\n\nExcuse them, they know of what they do\n\nSparring is training,don't let Denzel Training Day you\nSensei could catch a fade too\nWe be onnat elegant hella melanin\nPelle Pelle's since they crayons and jelly pens\n\nAnd now you know Noname ain't never for none\n(Ayo, you know Chano ain't never for none)\nAnd now you know Noname ain't never for none\n(Ayo, you know Chano ain't never for none)\nAha, and you don't stop\nBoom bap, and you don't stop\nI told you that was gonna be fun though", "image": "https://images.rapgenius.com/9c9553c23366eefea89fc896c49e9303.500x500x1.jpg", "artist": "Chance The Rapper", "raw": {"annotation_count": 42, "api_path": "/songs/2280404",

way\nDrunk off of light, lies, laughing\nClaiming asylum while shying in shade\nI can't stay silent, I go violent when my violets is gray\nAnd my roses is black\nFuck the pharaohs and pharisees, Moses is back\nI don't need to see a Sphinx to know they noses was black\nI don't know one temptation that had Otis' back\nSparring is training this a jumping jack\nI'm the scariest jack in the pumpkin patch\nFloat like my jumper wet, sting like a bumblebee\nI swing like a lumber jack, go back when I'm up at bat\nThey tried to label me a non-rapper\nI'm an independent contractor\nCard cracker, sparring is training without the training wheels\nYou made it, you made it, you made it, yeah, you made a deal\nYou played it straight, hated, graduated, waited, waited\nYou still a waiter still\nMice will always find out ways to steal\nPicture me, fifth of Hennessy and the swisher sweet\nFake identity, 'til a plug named Trinity shook me\n\"Wake up, wake up\" like remember me?\nSaid one plus one make three, and you finna see\nYou ain't as grown as you finna be\nYou got them young nigga tendencies\n\nSentimental energy\nI let the light in beside him, I stand like angel\nSparring is training for an apathetic halo\nApologetic, non religious, consequential fable\nLike good is good, the love in me is goodly or godly\nThe Bible say mistakes is necessary\nSo I Mississippi monologue to granny house\nMy soloist is sold out to attentive God\nCornbread on my table when I say my prayers\nOn airs, to stairs where shadiness is time to rest or manifest\nSparring is training, I know they think me bumblebee\nAfro-Americano Sunny D\nBut bet I sting, no die\n\nSparring is training\n\nJacob wrestled with God, in the desert 'til he broke him\nAnd he blessed him and he rescued his heart\nI struggle with love, I juggle my loves\nI cuddle and coddle, ship wreckin' bottle, I huddle in hugs\nSparring is training bra, Ramses watching raining frogs\nJigga watching Damon, Damon watching Wayans Bros\nA tandem unicycle with two pilots in different maps\n\nYou giving back?\n(I'm giving back)\nTit for tat\n\nSynagogue and bottle caps\nA body in the underpass says, where's my Jesus?\nPledge allegiance to the money now\nWe runnin down to kiddie parks where darker kids be casualty\nLike come with me, to the museum\n\nExcuse them, they know of what they do\n\nSparring is training,don't let Denzel Training Day you\nSensei could catch a fade too\nWe be onnat elegant hella melanin\nPelle Pelle's since they crayons and jelly pens\n\nAnd now you know Noname ain't never for none\n(Ayo, you know Chano ain't never for none)\nAnd now you know Noname ain't never for none\n(Ayo, you know Chano ain't never for none)\nAha, and you don't stop\nBoom bap, and you don't stop\nI told you that was gonna be fun though"}}, {"title": "I Was A Rock (Muhammad Ali ESPYs Tribute)", "album": null, "year": "2016-07-13", "lyrics": "Kid: \"I'd like to know what you're going to do when you retire from

Sosa!\nShout my nigga Fat Trel, shout my nigga Joseph\nPlaying Buenos Aires while they sleepin': buenas noches!\nWonder if I wrote this, 'cause it's so crisp\nThe most brokest cold stock broker,

Yo no s\u00e9\nI ain't really been myself since Rod passed\nI ain't even really need that shop class\nI ain't really been weak since pop's smashed\nI'm a genius, a mothafuckin pop smash\nHit sensei, master\nJack and Lindsey, Wiley, Kembe\nBeen paid, 10 Day been they FAFSA\n\nJuice!

yelling, \u201cCall his father\u201d\nBut people don\u2019t hear ghost, so how they gon' play me?\nMoney saved me, so I\u2019ma do the same thing\nYou droppin' pounds, gettin' small on some sick shit\nLike how you got the drive but don\u2019t know how to use a stick shift?\nYou better not miss this, overdose dope and mix this\nLet your throat close with a boatload of dope quotes within it\n\nLong time now since I seen you smile\nLong time long time now, since I seen you smile\nAnd it's been a long time, long time now\nSince I seen you smile\n\nDropping tapes 'till I lost the count\nCoughing out blood\nDropping weight like I lost an ounce\nThrowing words and tossing nouns\nNY traveling, I\u2019m Boston bound, bossing 'round homies\nAnd talking down to shorties while I\u2019m jotting down\nNotes to spit to Harlem crowds\nSurfing through the Harlem crowds\nAt the crib I\u2019m falling down\nI'm on the floor crawling 'round\nI\u2019m calling out to God, \"You\u2019re little angel's falling down\nSave me from my darkened cloud\nReach your hands and arms around\"\n\nLong time long time now, since I seen your smile\nWe miss you\n\n#10Day\nIt's been a really, really long time, long time\nSince a goof ass nigga done tried me\nLabel niggas wanna sign me\nAnd lame ol' nigga wanna buy me\nFood and weed and drink and shit\nJust as long as you inkin shit\nSometimes I can't pay for food\nCause sometimes I can't think of shit\nWhere's your head at? Where's your head at?\nSinging my shit like you just said that\nWanging my shit like where'd you hear that?\nYoung ass nigga where you headed?

the dress\nAnd the silver buttons fade away\nMiss Mary Mattress, geriatrics\nFuck me into open caskets, I wanna die with this\nI wanna stop seeing my psychiatrist\nShe said \"pill pop, baby girl 'cause I promise you, you tweaked\nThe empty bottled loneliness, this happiness you seek\"\nThe masochism that you preach\nPractice back flips, tragic actress\nOn a movie with no screen\nWhen the only

sleep with my eyes wide\nHoping that I find you\n(And now for something completely different)\nAnd I don't know why I sleep with my eyes wide\nHoping that I find you\nAnd hoping that I find you\nI been hoping that I find you\nI'm missing you\nI'm missing you\nI'm missing you\nI'm missing you\nI'm missing you\n(In the real world, we just people with ideas)\n(In the real world, we just people

Boat\nChance\nThugger!\nLil Boat\n\nAm I the only nigga still care about mixtapes?\nAm I the only nigga still care about mixtapes?\nI'm the only nigga still care about mixtapes\nBad little bitch, wanna know how lips taste\n(She curious, she curious)\nI swear I'm the only nigga still care about mixtapes\nBad little bitch, wanna know how the lips taste\n\nAll I can hear is the third, ayy\nAll I can hear is the third, ayy\nWe don't know none of your words, ayy\nWe don't know none of your words, ayy\nI love my women real tall, ayy\nType that can really play ball, ayy\nYou buy my hat at the park, ayy\nThink I might really play ball, ayy\nI got a link in my bio\nMy bitch do the salsa like pico de gallo\nThey gotta ask if they may, Cinco de Mayo\nHow can they call themselves bosses\nWhen they got so many bosses\nYou gotta see what your boss say\nI get it straight out the faucet\nI ain't felt like this since the third Drought, third Carter drop\nTold my momma third grade I'd be in the third Barbershop\nAnd yeah, my momma got real worried when she heard college drop\nBut now I call the shots\n\nI'm the only nigga still care about mixtapes\nBad little bitch wanna know how lips taste\nI swear I'm the only nigga still cares about mixtapes\nBad little bitch wanna know how lips taste\n\nBad little mama, she gettin' it Obama\nShe sting like a bumble bee, hot as the sauna\nShe shine like a Rollie, got that from her momma\nCan't see me, can't be me, I'm ridin' like a panda\nThat booty gon' roll and it's outta control\nAnd these bitches gon' fuck off respect and that loyalty\nAll my bitches lovin' me and they spoil me\nRub me down with that lotion, babe oil me\nDrinking Actavis, baby I'm showin' me\nIn that choppa I see your perimeter\nChange the culture, cause my ring is a solar\nWait one minute I told you\nYeah, I would like to know you\nYeah, you lucky like clovers\nYeah, the clothes no good\nMama I do it\nThe racks I pursue it\nJust look at me baby\nI came from the sewers\nThey love all the slime ball\nLike they fuck all these cats on your slime dog\nI got me some rings like I'm Bruce Bowen\nI'm ballin' on you like I'm Chris Paul\n\nI'm the only nigga still care about mixtapes\nBad little bitch wanna know how lips taste\nI swear I'm the only nigga still care about mixtapes\nBad little bitch wanna know how lips taste\n\nAm I the only one who really care about cover art?\nGrowing up I ain't have my brother\n'Cause he said the streets gave him a fresh start\nI ain't know what that mean\nI bumped heads with my dean\nDropped out and hit the scene\nNow I'm stunting like bling\nTime and time again, they told me no\nThey told me I wouldn't go\n'Cause in high school all I cared about was hoes\nWell, maybe that shit was my interest\nNow I spend more than they make at my dentist\nAfter 1Night the folks thought I was finished\nI pinned my name to the game like a seamstress\nOh, bitch I bite like a gator\nFuck them reviews that they put in the paper\nDid what I wanted, didn't care about a hater\nDelivered my tape to the world as a caterer\nOh, they fuck with me cause I'm different\nNew sound, new appearance\nBitch, it's Boat from the 6\nGive a fuck about a bitch\nWalk out, my hand on my dick, I'm the shit\n\nI'm the only nigga still care about mixtapes\nBad little bitch wanna know how lips taste\nI said am I the only nigga still care about mixtapes\nBad little bitch wanna know how lips taste"}}, {"title": "My Way*", "album": null, "year": null, "lyrics": "Lyrics will be available upon release.

devour\nHearts turning sour\nI want to put my twins in a tower\nSo I could hoop in my basement and swim in my shower\nChoke holding my wine glass\nPropose a toast to the noggin\nI got holes in my socks and coal in my stocking\nSanta was on dirt with all the poor kids in Chatham\nSo I rode to the north pole with a pole and I shot him\nBatman, Gotham\nAutumn\nI ought to start selling them\nBut I

'bout\nThe time I cracked my head open at Auntie Linda\u2019s House\nFrom diapers to outfits to castles to Elmos\nFrom Santas to Grandmas to Gameboys and cellphones\nRocked your world, fourth grade talent show\nJada and Justin\u2019s birthday magic show\nGames of tips taking niggas to school\nTwo quarters and I\u2019ll bust your ass at pool, on bull\nRound here we lose best friends like every week\nI like to think we playin a long game of hide and go seek\nAnd one day maybe I\u2019ma find Terrance and I could lead them\nKids of the Kingdom singing about freedom\n\nHeads down, eyes shut, time to play Seven Up\nHeads bowed, hands clutched, bottles gone, Heavens up\nSmiles come through, though my eyes might cry\nWhen they reminisce over you, my God\n\nLet\u2019s take it back like Indian givers\nTo Indian burns and Jiminy Crickets\nTo the smell of Pillsbury on biscuit mornings\nTo puffy wintercoats and Christmas mornings\nI used to chill with the kids next door\nAnd SpongeBob came around 'bout four\nAnd then I\u2019d hang with Bart\u2019s guys\nAround the bend was Smart Guy\nFlipping through the picture books\nChecking through my archives\nRemember the old days, the ones you\u2019ll never get back\nAt the end of parties, passing around gift bags\nNow we blow entire O's at one kick back\nMY$FITS and mismatch that get off like wrist slaps, uhh\n\nHeads down, eyes shut, time to play Seven Up\nHeads bowed, hands clutched, bottles gone, Heavens up\nSmiles come through, though my eyes might cry\nWhen they reminisce over you, my God\nWhen they reminisce over you, my God\n\nRemember Jeepers and Odyssey Fun World\nYoung pimpin' like you oughta see one girl\nMama Jann, mama Charlie, and my mama Lisa\nBooster seat used to boost my kitty, Connie's Pizza\nAnd every year we made a Christmas list\nAnd Auntie Linda cooked a Christmas dish\nAnd all of our grandparents made a Christmas wish\nLike \u201cLord, let me see another year like this\u201d, uhh\n\nHeads down, eyes shut, time to play Seven Up\nHeads bowed, hands clutched, bottles gone, Heavens up\nSmiles come through, though my eyes might cry\nWhen they reminisce over you, my God\nWhen they reminisce over you, my God"}}, {"title": "Not Sober (Freestyle)", "album": null, "year": null, "lyrics": "They say keep going\nHe said he came from Hawaii\nThen everybody done tried me, I can't go by me\n(I've never

neighborhood watch\nPray for a safer hood, when my paper good, watch\nCaptain save the hood, Hood Saviour\nBaby boy, still getting ID'ed for swishers\nMama still wash my clothes\nStill with the save money militia\nI'ma still watch my bros\nTrapped in the middle of the map\nWith a little bit of rock and little bit of rap\nThat with a literary knack and a little shitty Mac\nAnd like literally jack\n x 2\nI've been riding around with my blunt on my lips\nWith the sun in my eyes and my gun on my hip\nParanoia on my mind, got my mind on the fritz\nBut a lot of niggas dying, so my 9 with the shits\nThey murking kids, they murder kids here\nWhy you think they don't talk about it?\nThey deserted us here\nWhere the fuck is Matt Lauer at?\nSomebody get Katie Couric in here\nProlly scared all the refugees\nAway like we had a fucking hurricane in here\nAnd we shooting whether it's dark or not\nI mean the day is pretty dark a lot\nDown here it's easier to find a gun\nThan it is to find a fucking parking spot\nNo love for the opposition\nSpecifically a cop position\nCause they never been in our position\nGetting violations for the nation, correlating, you dry snitching\n\n x 2\nI'm riding around with my blunt on my lips\nWith the sun in my eyes and my gun on my hip\nParanoia on my mind, got my mind on the fritz\nBut a lot of niggas dying, so my 9 with the streets\nI know, you scared, you should ask us if we scared too\nI know, you scared, me too\nI know, you scared, you should ask us if we scared too\nI know, you scared, me too\n\nIt just got warm out\nIt's the shit I've been worrying bout\nI hope that it's storm in the morning\nI hope that it's pouring out\nI hate crowded beaches\nI hate the sound of fireworks\nAnd I ponder what's worse\nBetween knowing it's over and dying first\nCause everybody dies in the summer\nWanna say goodbye tell them while it's spring\nI heard everybody dying in the summer\nSo pray to god for a little more spring\nI know, you scared, you

Bender\nChance Bennett, a peculiar name\nGraduation night teachers Ferris Bueller'd my name\nYou made a mixtape? Good job, I hope you get a good job\nWe was all outcasts, only listened to Good Mob\nI performed at fun fair, fun fact\nI'm never going back to school, been there, done that\nThey see my little 10 Day tape and my dumb raps\nDon't call it impossible, if you really want that\nThey send my ass to summer school, don't call it a comeback\nI just came to beat a bully's ass and get my lunch back\nChano y tequila you know you know you don't want that\nI rap my songs in Spanglish, I wrap my weed in blunt wraps\nWrapped up in this one line I hope that shit get unwrapped\nAs if niggas was getting signed off of a line off one rap\nYo Vic, remember when they called us some freshmen niggas rapping?\nNow I ain't gonna be a freshman and I'm rapping\nI should've learned a lesson from all of this shit happening\nI just look over to Justin for refreshments of the Captain\nIt's sipping when it's weak sauce, it's shots if it's cracking\nSip it when we tear up, and chug it if we laughing\nFuck it if we're fucked up I never thought of Chatham\nUntil the day they said I would have to chat without em\nAnd I'm just in the studio hoping that it sounds right\nHere's a brighter bulb for your limelight\nAnd this is your night, homie, shine bright\nThis for everybody's fucking prom night\n\nAnd it's alright, and it's okay\nAnd we're all good, we're with homies\nAny problems, you can call us\nIt's all love, it's all love\nAnd it's alright, and it's okay\nAnd we're all good, we're with homies\nAny problems, you can call us\nIt's all love, it's all love\n\nUh, yo this prom shit feel like the Grammy's yo\nThese pictures Granny took gonna make me ask where'd Granny go\nSo pass the Sanyo to Auntie Jo\nAnd snap a couple candid's of the family, get some cameos\nYou can change the clocks but you can't change hours\nI'm waiting on the day, Spring can't bring flowers\nLet me ask for minutes from dad for those campaign hours\nAnd pour these thirsty hoes a couple champagne showers\nAnd hop up in that limo, the hood going dummy\nThe hood fucking love me, the hood think we lovely\nSo go and pop some bubbly, this right here's to loyalty\nThis to a moment's glimpse at royalty\nThis is for my momma Jan who spoiled me\nLook what we've accomplished\nTime flies, watches look like magnets on a compass\nBefore we dip, Gladys said a prayer over the limo\nBumping 10 Day with the Angels with Jesus shopping my demo\nAnd rode up out of Chatham, the whole hood clapping\nAnd damn it would be crazy if any of this shit had happened\nBut it didn't, I missed prom, I missed it to spin\nI did a show at AKIN and I would do it again\n\nAnd it's alright, and it's okay\nAnd we're all good, we're with homies\nAny problems, you can call us\nIt's all love, it's all love\nAnd it's alright, and it's okay\nAnd we're all good, we're with homies\nAny problems, you can call us\nIt's all love, it's all love\n\nLook at, look at your business tux, all night airplane\nGo and get your racist on, all white everything\nI'm on my paper now, put that on my heading\nI ain't even write this down I don't write errthing\nI know y'all don't like everything\nShe want a night she can call her wedding\nGiving Eskimo kisses, with some Eskimo bitches\nNose diving, going all night sledding\nCoked out like \"Don't change when you grow up\nI hope you get some change when you blow up\"\nCause honestly I've always loved the way that you could throw up\nRest up on my shoulder, float up flying lotus\n\"You deserve a warm towel, you deserve a soda\nYou deserve a quiet room, you deserve a sofa\nYou deserve a Ferrari and a matching tiara\nAnd a hand to wipe away all that running mascara\"\nBut I, I want to thank you for this prom night\nThank you for this prom night\nThank you for this prom night\nI really enjoyed my prom night\n\nAnd it's alright, and it's okay\nAnd we're all good, we're with homies\nAny problems, you can call us\nIt's all love, it's all love\n\nSo good, so right, hey baby\nSo good, so right\nYou know it feels so good\nSo good, so right\nTo be with you tonight\nSo good, so right\nTo be with you tonight\nSo good, so right\nTo be with you tonight", "image":

Bueller'd my name\nYou made a mixtape? Good job, I hope you get a good job\nWe was all outcasts, only listened to Good Mob\nI performed at fun fair, fun fact\nI'm never going back to school, been there, done that\nThey see my little 10 Day tape and my dumb raps\nDon't call it impossible, if you really want that\nThey send my ass to summer school, don't call it a comeback\nI just came to beat a bully's ass and get my lunch back\nChano y tequila you know you know you don't want that\nI rap my songs in Spanglish, I wrap my weed in blunt wraps\nWrapped up in this one line I hope that shit get unwrapped\nAs if niggas was getting signed off of a line off one rap\nYo Vic, remember when they called us some freshmen niggas rapping?\nNow I ain't gonna be a freshman and I'm rapping\nI should've learned a lesson from all of this shit happening\nI just look over to Justin for refreshments of the Captain\nIt's sipping when it's weak sauce, it's shots if it's cracking\nSip it when we tear up, and chug it if we laughing\nFuck it if we're fucked up I never thought of Chatham\nUntil the day they said I would have to chat without em\nAnd I'm just in the studio hoping that it sounds right\nHere's a brighter bulb for your limelight\nAnd this is your night, homie, shine bright\nThis for everybody's fucking prom night\n\nAnd it's alright, and it's okay\nAnd we're all good, we're with homies\nAny problems, you can call us\nIt's all love, it's all love\nAnd it's alright, and it's okay\nAnd we're all good, we're with homies\nAny problems, you can call us\nIt's all love, it's all love\n\nUh, yo this prom shit feel like the Grammy's yo\nThese pictures Granny took gonna make me ask where'd Granny go\nSo pass the Sanyo to Auntie Jo\nAnd snap a couple candid's of the family, get some cameos\nYou can change the clocks but you can't change hours\nI'm waiting on the day, Spring can't bring flowers\nLet me ask for minutes from dad for those campaign hours\nAnd pour these thirsty hoes a couple champagne showers\nAnd hop up in that limo, the hood going dummy\nThe hood fucking love me, the hood think we lovely\nSo go and pop some bubbly, this right here's to loyalty\nThis to a moment's glimpse at royalty\nThis is for my momma Jan who spoiled me\nLook what we've accomplished\nTime flies, watches look like magnets on a compass\nBefore we dip, Gladys said a prayer over the limo\nBumping 10 Day with the Angels with Jesus shopping my demo\nAnd rode up out of Chatham, the whole hood clapping\nAnd damn it would be crazy if any of this shit had happened\nBut it didn't, I missed prom, I missed it to spin\nI did a show at AKIN and I would do it again\n\nAnd it's alright, and it's okay\nAnd we're all good, we're with homies\nAny problems, you can call us\nIt's all love, it's all love\nAnd it's alright, and it's okay\nAnd we're all good, we're with homies\nAny problems, you can call us\nIt's all love, it's all love\n\nLook at, look at your business tux, all night airplane\nGo and get your racist on, all white everything\nI'm on my paper now, put that on my heading\nI ain't even write this down I don't write errthing\nI know y'all don't like everything\nShe want a night she can call her wedding\nGiving Eskimo kisses, with some Eskimo bitches\nNose diving, going all night sledding\nCoked out like \"Don't change when you grow up\nI hope you get some change when you blow up\"\nCause honestly I've always loved the way that you could throw up\nRest up on my shoulder, float up flying lotus\n\"You deserve a warm towel, you deserve a soda\nYou deserve a quiet room, you deserve a sofa\nYou deserve a Ferrari and a matching tiara\nAnd a hand to wipe away all that running mascara\"\nBut I, I want to thank you for this prom night\nThank you for this prom night\nThank you for this prom night\nI really enjoyed my prom night\n\nAnd it's alright, and it's okay\nAnd we're all good, we're with homies\nAny problems, you can call us\nIt's all love, it's all love\n\nSo good, so right, hey baby\nSo good, so right\nYou know it feels so good\nSo good, so right\nTo be with you tonight\nSo good, so right\nTo be with you tonight\nSo good, so right\nTo be with you tonight"}}, {"title":

Every day is a workday. It's hard to explain. When you're working on shit every day and it comes back full circle three months later, it doesn't hit you the same way. Cause it's something I knew I was working on.\nCan you gauge your increasing fame?\nDefinitely. I do recognize it all the time. But it's not like . . . I don't necessarily feed into the whole newfound-fame type shit, or feeling like a different person. If anything, it makes me realize how fleeting and unreal it all is. It's all just about perspective. I just feel like it's not real. It's real, but only in the way it affects those around you. Fame or perceived success \u2013 it all comes from groupthink.\n...\nHave you thought about signing with a label?\nThere's no reason to. It's a dead industry.\n\nIs it also because you like maintaining direct control over your career?\nI don't really have control over my direct impression on people anymore. I used to be the person putting my CD in people's hands. But I'm kind of a mainstream artist now. Not by choice. Not by what I make or anything. But just by that ripple-effect shit.\n\nWhen will we get an Acid Rap follow-up?\nThe whole point of Acid Rap was just to ask people a question: does the music business side of this dictate what type of project this is? If it's all original music and it's got this much emotion around it and it connects this way with this many people, is it a mixtape? What's an album these days, anyways? Cause I didn't sell it, does that mean it's not an official release? So I might not ever drop a for-sale project. Maybe I'll just make my money touring.", "image": "https://images.genius.com/d5771671554a8976b034671291d2bca7.527x527x1.jpg", "artist": "Chance The Rapper", "raw": {"annotation_count": 12, "api_path":

Every day is a workday. It's hard to explain. When you're working on shit every day and it comes back full circle three months later, it doesn't hit you the same way. Cause it's something I knew I was working on.\nCan you gauge your increasing fame?\nDefinitely. I do recognize it all the time. But it's not like . . . I don't necessarily feed into the whole newfound-fame type shit, or feeling like a different person. If anything, it makes me realize how fleeting and unreal it all is. It's all just about perspective. I just feel like it's not real. It's real, but only in the way it affects those around you. Fame or perceived success \u2013 it all comes from groupthink.\n...\nHave you thought about signing with a label?\nThere's no reason to. It's a dead industry.\n\nIs it also because you like maintaining direct control over your career?\nI don't really have control over my direct impression on people anymore. I used to be the person putting my CD in people's hands. But I'm kind of a mainstream artist now. Not by choice. Not by what I make or anything. But just by that ripple-effect shit.\n\nWhen will we get an Acid Rap follow-up?\nThe whole point of Acid Rap was just to ask people a question: does the music business side of this dictate what type of project this is? If it's all original music and it's got this much emotion around it and it connects this way with this many people, is it a mixtape? What's an album these days, anyways? Cause I didn't sell it, does that mean it's not an official release? So I might not ever drop a for-sale project. Maybe I'll just make my money touring."}}, {"title": "Run Up", "album": null, "year": null, "lyrics": "Chance The Rapper\nIGH\nY'all know where to find me\n102 nigga behind me\nY'all can't get that

up\nI was too late, I was too late\nA shadow of what I once was\n'Cause we don't, we don't do what we say we're gonna\nYou were always perfect, and I was only practice\nDon't you miss the days, stranger?\nDon't you miss the days?\nDon't you miss the danger?\n\nWe don't (we don't) do the same drugs no more (do the same drugs no more)\nWe don't do the, we don't do the same drugs, do the same drugs no more\nWe don't (we don't) do the same drugs no more (do the same drugs no more)\nWe don't do the, we don't do the same drugs, do the same drugs no more\nWe don't do the, we don't do the same drugs\n\n(Turn it around\nI remember when\nThis age of pathetics)\nDon't forget the happy thoughts\nAll you need is happy thoughts\nThe past tense, past bed time\nWay back then when everything we read was real\nAnd everything we said rhymed\nWide eyed kids being kids\nWhy did you stop?\nWhat did you do to your hair?\nWhere did you go to end up right back here?\nWhen did you start to forget how to fly?\n(It's so natural\nJust like Juicy Fruit\nWorks like a magic trick\nPlease give me half of that\nWe don't, we don't, we don't)\nDon't you color out\nDon't you bleed on out, oh\nStay in the line, stay in the line\nDandelion\n(Do the same drugs no more\nWe don't do the, we don't do the same drugs, do the same drugs no more\nWe don't, we don't, we don't....)\nDon't you color out\nDon't you bleed

never\nWindow closed, Wendy got old\nI was too late, I was too late\nA shadow of what I once was\n\n'Cause we don't do the same drugs no more\nWe don't do the, we don't do the same drugs, do the same drugs no more\nShe don't laugh the same way no more\nWe don't do the, we don't do the same drugs, do the same drugs no more\n\nWhere did you go?\nWhy would you stay?\nYou must have lost your marbles\nYou always were so forgetful\nIn a hurry, don't wait up\nI was too late, I was too late\nA shadow of what I once was\n'Cause we don't, we don't do what we say we're gonna\nYou were always perfect, and I was only practice\nDon't you miss the days, stranger?\nDon't you miss the days?\nDon't you miss the danger?\n\nWe don't (we don't) do the same drugs no more (do the same drugs no more)\nWe don't do the, we don't do the same drugs, do the same drugs no more\nWe don't (we don't) do the same drugs no more (do the same drugs no more)\nWe don't do the, we don't do the same drugs, do the same drugs no more\nWe don't do the, we don't do the same drugs\n\n(Turn it around\nI remember when\nThis age of pathetics)\nDon't forget the happy thoughts\nAll you need is happy thoughts\nThe past tense, past bed time\nWay back then when everything we read was real\nAnd everything we said rhymed\nWide eyed kids being kids\nWhy did you stop?\nWhat did you do to your hair?\nWhere did you go to end up right back here?\nWhen did you start to forget how to fly?\n(It's so natural\nJust like Juicy Fruit\nWorks like a magic trick\nPlease give me half of that\nWe don't, we don't, we don't)\nDon't you color out\nDon't you bleed on out, oh\nStay in the line, stay in the line\nDandelion\n(Do the same drugs no more\nWe don't do the, we don't do the same drugs, do the same drugs no more\nWe don't, we don't, we don't....)\nDon't you color out\nDon't you bleed on out, oh\nStay in the line, stay in the line\nDandelion"}}, {"title": "Save Yourself First", "album": null, "year":

wrap the purple, wrap that blunt under after\nSmoke all out the window, cops could eat a dick\nIf you ain't the hitter, you just might be the lick\nFlame on, flame on, I'm your bitch's ringtone\nShe like when I rap raps, but better when I sing songs\nNo Drake, but I get my Trey on, killin' in the hood like Trayvon\nShoppin' like I got a coupon, savin' like I got a cape on\nCookin' crack in my apron, dressed like a nigga had 8 proms\nTell shorty I may change and I made it and I napalm\nTrippy shit to watch drugs while on the clock\nAcid on the face that's a work of art\n\nI don't even talk to them on the phone again\nLeave in the AM, on the road again\nSo bitch, let's fuck so I can smoke again\nI gotta smoke again, I got shit to do\nI don't even talk to them on the phone again\nLeave in

let's fuck so I can smoke again\nI gotta smoke again, I got shit to do\nI don't even talk to them on the phone again\nLeave in the AM, on the road again\nSo bitch, let's fuck so I can smoke again\nI gotta smoke again, I got shit to do\n\nSoulo hoe hoe twerk somethin'\nThrow it back like you tryna hurt somethin'\nI'm so def, I ain't ever heard nothin'\nMy name Herb, take herb, smoke herb (say word?)\nHow 'bout you? No dap, but I'll take a pound or two\nNo doubt like Gwen Stefani's group\nLook, let me put my mouth where you potty, boo (IGH!)\nThem niggas pissed, need potty training\nThey movement shit, that's a potty train\nShe ain't left yet, but she probably came\nWe kicked it then I score, soccer game\nShe was a phony goalie, I got great aim though, don't insult me\nI'll give it to ya straight, this is what she told me\nMy name Soulo cause I'm the one and only\nShe only got you as a nigga on the side\nThat's a nigga on the side of a side bitch, homie\nThen we got out a Dodge, like them Dukes of Hazzard\nMusic and tabs of Lucy, take your chance with this rapper\n\nI don't even talk to them on the phone again\nLeave in the AM, on the road again\nSo bitch, let's fuck so I can smoke again\nI gotta smoke again, I got shit to do\nI don't even talk to them on the phone again\nLeave in the AM, on the road again\nSo bitch, let's fuck so I can smoke again\nI gotta smoke again, I got shit to

when I sing songs\nNo Drake, but I get my Trey on, killin' in the hood like Trayvon\nShoppin' like I got a coupon, savin' like I got a cape on\nCookin' crack in my apron, dressed like a nigga had 8 proms\nTell shorty I may change and I made it and I napalm\nTrippy shit to watch drugs while on the clock\nAcid on the face that's a work of art\n\nI don't even talk to them on the phone again\nLeave

No dap, but I'll take a pound or two\nNo doubt like Gwen Stefani's group\nLook, let me put my mouth where you potty, boo (IGH!)\nThem niggas pissed, need potty training\nThey movement shit, that's a potty train\nShe ain't left yet, but she probably came\nWe kicked it then I score, soccer game\nShe was a phony goalie, I got great aim though, don't insult me\nI'll give it to ya straight, this is what she told me\nMy name Soulo cause I'm the one and only\nShe only got you as a nigga on the side\nThat's a nigga on the side of a side bitch, homie\nThen we got out a Dodge, like them Dukes of Hazzard\nMusic and tabs of Lucy, take your chance with this rapper\n\nI don't even talk to them on the phone again\nLeave in the AM, on the road again\nSo bitch, let's fuck so I can smoke again\nI

just been smoking a bowl\nWe just been smoking a bowl\nWe just been smoking a, we just\nWhat the fuck is going on?\nWhen did we buy a bowl?\n\nWe just been smoking a bowl\nWe don't got no time to roll\nI'm always out on the road\nShe don't got time for a whole\nLittle bit of time that we have\nWe used to purchase a half\nIt don't be no time to smoke\nI'm always throwing on clothes\nShe always throwing a fit\nWe don't got no time for no sex\nI just put milk in the bowl\nShe don't be cooking at all\nShe just put weed in the bowl\nShe don't have time for herself\nShe putting points on the board, yes\nYou know she carry her own\nYou know she carry a child\nShe wake up at crack of dawn\nShe don't be cracking a smile\nSo when she packing the bowl\nI grab her, I tell her\n\nLet me crack this blunt\nSlow it down for a second\nBreak it down, ooh\nShe said, \"let me lick this blunt\"\nSlow it down for a second\nBreak it down, ooh\nWe deserve, we deserve\nWe deserve, a smoke break\nWe deserve, we deserve\nWe deserve, a smoke break\n\nTruth being told, we used to movies and bowl\nWe used to Netflix and roll\nI used to pass her the smoke\nShe used to laugh at my jokes\nYou pat my back when I choke\nWish we were stuck in our ways\nWe way too young to get old\nWe stuck together like oowops\nWe smoke to Fetty, sing ZooWap\nTraphouse 3, Guwop\nI shoulda knew when I grew up\nIt would be no time at all\nWe went from White Owls to Raws\nWe went from joints to a bowl\nShe need a second to breathe\nWe need an actual smoke sesh\n\nLet me crack your back\nSlow it down for a second\nTake it down, ooh\nLet me run this back\nSlow it down for a minute\nYou deserve, you deserve\nWe deserve, we deserve\nWe deserve, a smoke break\nWe deserve, we deserve\nWe deserve, a smoke break\n\nI don't have time to finesse\nI put some ice on your neck\nBut I ain't holding you back\nI spend my time on the road\nSuper ain't saving no hoes\nI don't have time to patrol\nLet me break these bales right down for a second\nWhen it touch down, ooh\nI got to lay back the roof\nI got her breakin' the new rules\nShe can't be taking no calls\nWhen she involved with a boss\nPlease don't get lost in the sauce\nPlease don't get lost in the sauce\nShe been like this from the door\nTold me her mom was a whore\nI gave her percs for myself\nI give her a perc for esteem\nI'm tryna crown me a queen\nYou hear the chains when they cling\nI take the molly its clean\nI push the whip with the wings\nI gotta be overseas\nI gotta be on the pedal\nI push it down to the floor\nI got designer galore\nI keep some Goyard and gars\nI smoke out all of my cars\nYou smell the weed in the air\nYou smell the smoke in the seats\nYou went and had our child\nYou didn't abandon the D\nYou got me twisted at least\nYou can\n\nLet me crack your back\nLet me rub you all over\nTake it down, ooh\nLet me make this blunt\nMake you dinner or somethin'\nYou deserve, you deserve\nWe deserve, we

I'm savin' my city, say I'm stayin' for good\nThey screamin', \"Chano for mayor,\" I'm thinkin' maybe I should\nFucked a few A&R's, told 'em, \"Bitch I can\u2019t wife you\"\nTold your ass since day one, I don't like labels or titles\nI'm a rascally rabbit, I know that tricks is for addicts\nThat need fixes for habits, in love with carrots and cabbage\nI'm a savage, established, bad bitch magnet, I'm magic\nYour majesty, I'm majestic, I think my message is massive\nThink you passive aggressive\nI think you passed up your prime\nThink you passed up your chance to be Chance\nNow pass it to A-Rap\nI should have rhymed it with rhyme\nAin't we been here before?\nAin't my principal told me that I can't rap at that show?\nThen I rapped at that show, simple as that\nGot a complex from Complex off of the simplest raps\nAnd it goes like...\n\nFannin' the fire, hands is up higher\nCannot believe it, damn I'm a rider\nRidin' on twenties, twenty years prior, I couldn't buy a\nForget it you get

walkin' with Jesus, I knew my feet wouldn't drown\nI been close to the edge, I been trippin' and stuff\nSomebody slipped me a mickey\nBut I ain't giving a fuck\nReally, a milli? How 'bout six billion more\nOr I'm outie like how'd he cut that umbilical cord?\nAs I smoke herb in this Uber suburban dressed in an Urban Outfitters\nShirt and burgundy pair of Jordans\nI asked the acid if words were worth worryin' over\nHer explanation seemed agitated\nShe said let me answer your question\nWith some questions questionin' yours\nLike why the devil can't get you?\nAnd why these labels can't catch you?\nAnd why'd he make you so special, why did he bless you?\nThink about it\nI woke up this mornin'\nI woke up this mornin'\nGotta smile when I say that shit, I woke up this mornin'\nGo!\n\nFannin' the fire, hands is up higher\nCannot believe it, damn I'm a rider\nRidin' on twenties, twenty years prior, I couldn't buy a\nForget it you get it\nGod is so awesome, devil's a liar\nTake 'em to church, but I need a choir\n\nI believe, I believe, there's somewhere out there for us all, there's a paradise (there is a paradise)\nI believe that if I die, I'll see my homies somewhere in paradise\n(I'll see 'em somewhere in paradise)\n\nFannin' the fire, hands is up higher\nCannot believe it, damn I'm a rider\nRidin' on twenties, twenty years prior, I couldn't buy a\nForget it you get it\nGod is so awesome, devil's a liar\nTake 'em to church, but I need a choir\n\nI believe, I believe, I believe\nSomewhere in paradise\nI believe, I believe, I believe\nSomewhere in paradise\nI believe, I believe, I believe", "image": "https://images.rapgenius.com/d4667e86f5d50bcc6761d46cdf50391f.1000x1000x1.jpg", "artist": "Chance The Rapper", "raw": {"annotation_count": 26, "api_path": "/songs/312496", "description": {"dom": {"tag": "root", "children": [{"tag": "p", "children": ["Officially premiered when he ", {"tag": "a", "attributes": {"href": "http://au.complex.com/music/2015/12/chance-the-rapper-jeremih-somewhere-in-paradise-saturday-night-live", "rel": "nofollow"}, "children": ["first performed on ", {"tag": "em", "children": ["SNL"]}, ","]}, " \u201cSomewhere in Paradise\u201d talks about Chance\u2019s mainstream fame, and how he feels about it when he reminisces his ", {"tag": "a", "attributes": {"href": "https://genius.com/albums/Chance-the-rapper/10-day"}, "data": {"api_path": "/albums/15144"}, "children": [{"tag": "em", "children": ["10 Day"]}]}, " era.

believe...\n\nSocks on concrete, Jolly Rancher kids\nI was talkin' back and now I gotta stay at grandma's crib\nBunch of tank-top, nappy headed bike-stealin' Chatham boys\nNone of my niggas ain't had no dad\nNone of my niggas ain't have no choice\nJJ, Mikey, Lil Derek and them\n79th street was America then\nIce cream truck and the beauty supply\nBlockbuster movies and Harold's again\nWe were still catchin' lightnin' bugs\nWhen the plague hit the backyard\nHad to come in at dark cause the big shortys act hard\nOkay now, day camp at Grand Crossing\nFirst day, nigga's shootin'\nSummer school get to losin' students\nBut the CPD getting new recruitment\nOur summer don't, our summer\nOur summer don't get no shine no more\nOur summer die, our summertime don't got no time no more\n\n'Cause you're my friend\nSummer friends don't stay\nYou're my friend\nSummer friends don't stay, stay around\nSummer friends, summer friends\nYou're my friend\nSummer friends don't stay\nSummer friends don't stay, hey\nStay around here\n\nOh I used to kill 'em with the long hair\nMama hair salon doin' perms out the armchair\nDad was workin' late, he treat the crib like it's a timeshare\nI would mow some lawns\nFold my ones like a lawn chair, hugh, hugh!\nNow I'm the same way, overtime all the time, every night, hey\nReady my blessin', now I'm ready how I wait\nNever let a friendship get in my way\nNever let a blog get in my way\nMake the whole song do whatever I say\n79th, 79th, 79th, hey\n79th, 79th, 79th, hey\nSome of my homegirls got lost in the paperwork\nThey was good friends but I faked the flirt\n'Cause if it ain't work, can't make it work\nIt's been a minute since I called on a friend\nFucked up and fucked all my friends\n\n'Cause you're my friend\nAll my friends\nYou're my friend\nAll my...\nStick around\n\nSummer friends, summer...\nYou're my friend...\nSummer friends don't stick around\nStick around, hey\nAnd some of us...\n79th, 79th, 79th, hey\n79th, 79th, 79th, hey\n79th, 79th, 79th, hey, hey, hey\nYou're my friend\n79th, 79th, 79th, hey, 79th\nSo put your head on my shoulder\nCitywide, citywide, citywide, hey\nCitywide, citywide, citywide, hey\nCitywide,

citywide....\nI will wait around for you\nI will wait around for you\nSo lay your head on my table\nLay your, lay your head on my table\n\nMay the Lord give your journey mercy\nMay you be successful, grant you favor\nAnd bring you back safely, I love you\n\nWhen I was so young before I could remember\nI would always treat my gang like family members\nEven when I changed, a nigga never changed up\nI always bring my friends, my friends, my friends, my friends up\nWhen I was so young before I could remember\nI would always treat my gang like family members\nEven when I changed, a nigga never

"Happy holidays Mr President\n\nShe can say in her voice, in her way that she love me\nWith her eyes, with her smile, with her belt, with her hands, with her money\nI am the thesis of her prayers\nHer nieces and her nephews are just pieces of the layers\nOnly ones she love as much as me is Jesus Christ and Taylor\nI got a feature so I'm singing for my grandma\nYou singing too, but your grandma ain't my grandma\nMine's is handmade, pan fried, sun-dried\nSouthside, and beat the devil by a landslide\nPraying with her hands tied, president of my fan club, saying to her\nSomething told me I should bring my butt to church\n\nYou gotta move slowly\nTake and eat my body like it's holy\nI've been waiting for you for this whole week\nI've been praying for you, you're my Sunday candy\nYou gotta move it slowly\nTake and eat my body like it's holy\nI've been waiting for you for this whole week\nI've been praying for you, you're my Sunday candy\n\nCome on in this house, it's gonna rain\n(Mama you know!)\nRain down Zion\n(Rain down)\nIt's gonna rain\n(Mama you know!)\nRain down Zion, it's gonna rain\n(Mama you know!)\n(Mama you know!)\n\nI come to church for the candy, your peppermints is the truth\nI'm pessimistic on Monday if I had tweaked and missed you\nYou look so good with that hat on, had to match with the shoes\nCame and dressed in the satin, I came and sat in your pew\nI come to Christmas for dinner, fifty rolls on my plate\nHella holes in my stocking holding your pockets in place\nI like my love with a budget\nI like my hugs with a scent\nYou smell like lights, gas, water, electricity, rent\nYou sound like why the gospel choir got so tired\nSingin' his praises daily basis so I gotta try it\nYou're my dreamcatcher, dream team, team captain\nMatter fact, I haven't seen you in a minute let me take my butt to church\n\nYou better come on in this house\n(Come on in this house)\nCause it's gonna rain\n(Mama you know it's gonna rain)\nRain down Zion\n(Rain down)\nIt's gonna rain\n(Mama you know it's gonna rain)\nCome on down in this house\nIt's gonna rain\n(Mama you know)\nRain down\n\nMama you know it's gon' rain\nFather you know\n(Rain down)\nPromise you said it would rain\nFinally I'm home\n(Rain down)\nYou left on the light\nWhen I left on a flight\nBut I made it alright\n(Rain down)\nI've been waiting all week\nI've been waiting all night\n(On me, rain down)\nBaby, saving my life\nHad to say something on Saturday\nSee you at church on Sunday\nOpen mic coming on Monday\nI wonder what the Internet gon' say\nWhen SNL end with the ending to the 3rd\nChance fly down the chimney\nMe and Kiersten, Kensley, Lisa, Kenny, Taylor, Wendy all should win the Emmy\nMomma should too!\n\nCome on in this house, cause it's gonna rain\nRain down Zion, it's gonna rain\nYou better come on in this house, cause it's gonna rain\nRain down Zion, it's gonna rain", "image":

your grandma ain't my grandma\nMine's is handmade, pan fried, sun-dried\nSouthside, and beat the devil by a landslide\nPraying with her hands tied, president of my fan club, saying to her\nSomething told me I should bring my butt to church\n\nYou gotta move slowly\nTake and eat my body like it's holy\nI've been waiting for you for this whole week\nI've been praying for you, you're my Sunday

gonna rain\n(Mama you know!)\nRain down Zion\n(Rain down)\nIt's gonna rain\n(Mama you know!)\nRain down Zion, it's gonna rain\n(Mama you know!)\n(Mama you know!)\n\nI come to church for the candy, your peppermints is the truth\nI'm pessimistic on Monday if I had tweaked and missed you\nYou look so good with that hat on, had to match with the shoes\nCame and dressed in the satin, I came and sat in your pew\nI come to Christmas for dinner, fifty rolls on my plate\nHella holes in my stocking holding your pockets in place\nI like my love with a budget\nI like my hugs with a scent\nYou smell like lights, gas, water, electricity, rent\nYou sound like why the gospel choir got so tired\nSingin' his praises daily basis so I gotta try it\nYou're my dreamcatcher, dream team, team captain\nMatter fact, I haven't seen you in a minute let me take my butt to church\n\nYou better come on in this house\n(Come on in this house)\nCause it's gonna rain\n(Mama you know it's gonna rain)\nRain down Zion\n(Rain down)\nIt's gonna rain\n(Mama you know it's gonna rain)\nCome on down in this house\nIt's gonna rain\n(Mama you know)\nRain down\n\nMama you know it's gon' rain\nFather you know\n(Rain down)\nPromise you said it would rain\nFinally I'm home\n(Rain down)\nYou left on the light\nWhen I left on a flight\nBut I made it alright\n(Rain down)\nI've been waiting all week\nI've been waiting all night\n(On me, rain down)\nBaby, saving my life\nHad to say something on Saturday\nSee you at church on Sunday\nOpen mic coming on Monday\nI wonder what the Internet gon' say\nWhen SNL end with the ending to the 3rd\nChance fly down the chimney\nMe and Kiersten, Kensley, Lisa, Kenny, Taylor, Wendy all should win the Emmy\nMomma should too!\n\nCome on in this house,

gonna rain\n(*Mama you know it's gonna rain*)\n\nMama you know, Mama you know its gonna rain\nFather you know\nPromised, you said it would rain, finally I'm home\nYou left on the light when I left on the flight, but I made it alright\nI've been waiting all week, I've been waiting all night\nJason Van Dyke\nHad to say something on Saturday\nSee you at Church on Sunday\nOpen Mike coming on Monday\nI wonder what the internet gonna say\nWhen SNL end with the Indie\nThen the third tape slide down the chimney\nVia Kirsten, Kinsley, Lisa, Kenny, Taylor, Wendy, Austin win the Emmy, Mama Jan too\n\nCome on in this house, cause it's gonna rain\n(*Momma you know it's gone rain*)\nRain down Zion, it's gonna rain", "image": "https://images.genius.com/752d6aaed3922b7bb14746b479a8c6e2.711x1000x1.jpg",

prayers\nHer nieces and her nephews are just pieces of the layers\nOnly ones she love as much as me is Jesus Christ and Taylor\nI got a future so I'm singing for my grandma\nYou singing too, but your grandma ain't my grandma\nMine's is hand made, pan fried, sun dried\nSouthside, and beat the devil by a landslide\nPraying with her hands tied, president of my fan club, saying to her\nSomething told me I should bring my butt to church\n\nYou gotta move it slowly\nTake and eat my body like it's holy\nI've been waiting for you for the whole week\nI've been praying for you, you're my Sunday candy\n\nCome on in this house, cause it's gonna rain\n(*Mama you know it's gonna rain*)\nRain down Zion, it's gonna rain\n(*Mama you know it's gonna rain*)\n\nI come to church for the candy, your peppermints is the truth\nI'm pessimistic on Monday if I had tweaked and missed you\nYou look so good with that hat on, had to match with the shoes\nCame and dressed in the satin, I came and sat in your pew\nI come to Christmas for dinner, fifty rolls on my plate\nHella holes in my stocking holding your pockets in place\nI like my love with a budget, I like my hugs with a scent\nYou smell like light, gas, water, electricity, rent\nYou sound like why the gospel choir got so tired\nSingin his praises daily basis so I gotta try it\nYou're my dreamcatcher, dream team, team captain\nMatter fact, I ain't seen you in a minute let me take my butt to church\n\nCome on in this house, cause it's gonna rain\n(*Mama you know it's gonna rain*)\nRain down Zion, it's gonna rain\n(*Mama you know it's gonna rain*)\n\nMama you know, Mama you know its gonna rain\nFather you know\nPromised, you said it would rain, finally I'm home\nYou left on the light when I left on the flight, but I made it alright\nI've been waiting all week, I've been waiting all night\nJason Van Dyke\nHad to say something on Saturday\nSee you at Church on Sunday\nOpen Mike coming on Monday\nI wonder what the internet gonna say\nWhen SNL end with the Indie\nThen the third tape slide down the chimney\nVia Kirsten, Kinsley, Lisa, Kenny, Taylor, Wendy, Austin win the Emmy, Mama Jan too\n\nCome on in this house, cause it's gonna rain\n(*Momma you know it's gone rain*)\nRain down Zion, it's gonna rain"}}, {"title": "The Other Side", "album": null, "year": "2017-07-05", "lyrics": "I still have keys that are of no use

quartet\nCurtain's up, but the whole room darkened up\nI know winter was callin' you\nMe baby, my baby\nHe Chris with the Kringle in rooms filled with ladies\nThey lovin' his presence, a blessin' a

narrative's pace\nPut on a show for us, float for us\nMake it easy, make some mo' for us\nSave the day\nWe want a W, we tired of picking different sides\nI got your jersey, just a different size\nWe all want you to be a buzzer beater\nFind us a leader far from Silent Bob's and Cousin Skeeter's\nThrough the perilous fight, want you to be brave\nWe want us a hero, we need a teammate\n x 2\nPeople,

probation music\nThis is steppin' on the beach\nWhen you're too drunk to feel a beat\nThis that laughing in a condo\nThrowin' shit down in the street\nThis that shouts to the Ave, shouts to the lab\nShouts to the clucks, shouts to the strags\nThis for every math class that I ever had\nSo fuck you if I failed, and fuck you if I passed!\nFor shitty summaries and bummers in the past\nCause some of our teachers act as if summer was for class\nSome of us is seeing summer, some of us have passed\nSome of us ain't seeing summer, some of us have passed\nSo I'm just glad to say I'm sippin' rum up out a glass\nCause some of us is only sippin' some up off the grav\nAnd heaven's gates look a lot like prison from the Ave\nWe on the ground yelling, \"Give my nigga back!\"\n\nAnd I just want to roll with my windows down\nAnd I just want to roll with my windows down\n\nAnother weekend full of blunts and brews\nToo comfortable, yelling \"Fuck a school\"\nAin't seen the world before noon in like a month or two\nBlunts to the face, bottles to the dome\nNiggas never need no cup\nLivin' out dreams, never givin' hopes up\nRidin' with them Vill niggas, never givin' no fucks\nIn the game tryna get our feel, tryna get a deal\nTryna get a million\nJust ridin' around with my niggas and them\nReal white nigga man mean real appeal\nWe go all out 'til we fall out\nNiggas get called out then hauled out\nWith the windows down we like to smoke all out\nDrink 'til I fall out, fuck is you tahm bout boy\nThe Village is my brothers\nIt's me, Mikey, Kembe trappin'\nHella love for Chance The Rapper\nWe know 10 Day is a classic, on God\n\nAnd I just want to roll with my windows down\nAnd I just want to roll with my windows down\n\nThis is for sand in my shoes, shout out to Oak Street\nFor the free train rides, shout out to Polk Street\nTo the ice cream man you just on hella dirt\nHow you don't see us can't hear us, you Helen Keller\nBut I'mma save my dollars for Mary Jane and embellish her\nInhalin' her, smellin' her, maybe sellin' her\nYou niggas got cold feet, shouts to Luke Helliker\nBut that's my homie, my dude be droppin' hella verses\nSo, shouts to D.O.C. and Nu Tribe too\nMan we out this jam, see how new guys do\nBut its still save money like a coupon\nSo you can catch me off of the Ave gettin' my stoop on\n\nAnd I just want to roll with my windows down\nAnd I just want to roll with my windows down", "image": "https://images.rapgenius.com/99a56c0263624351265f01b7e7c3ec32.500x500x1.jpg", "artist": "Chance The Rapper", "raw": {"annotation_count": 21, "api_path":

month probation music\nThis is steppin' on the beach\nWhen you're too drunk to feel a beat\nThis that laughing in a condo\nThrowin' shit down in the street\nThis that shouts to the Ave, shouts to the lab\nShouts to the clucks, shouts to the strags\nThis for every math class that I ever had\nSo fuck you if I failed, and fuck you if I passed!\nFor shitty summaries and bummers in the past\nCause some of our teachers act as if summer was for class\nSome of us is seeing summer, some of us have passed\nSome of us ain't seeing summer, some of us have passed\nSo I'm just glad to say I'm sippin' rum up out a glass\nCause some of us is only sippin' some up off the grav\nAnd heaven's gates look a lot like prison from the Ave\nWe on the ground yelling, \"Give my nigga back!\"\n\nAnd I just want to roll with my windows down\nAnd I just want to roll with my windows down\n\nAnother weekend full of blunts and brews\nToo comfortable, yelling \"Fuck a school\"\nAin't seen the world before noon in like a month or two\nBlunts to the face, bottles to the dome\nNiggas never need no cup\nLivin' out dreams, never givin' hopes up\nRidin' with them Vill niggas, never givin' no fucks\nIn the game tryna get our feel, tryna get a deal\nTryna get a million\nJust ridin' around with my niggas and them\nReal white nigga man mean real appeal\nWe go all out 'til we fall out\nNiggas get called out then hauled out\nWith the windows down we like to smoke all out\nDrink 'til I fall out, fuck is you tahm bout boy\nThe Village is my brothers\nIt's me, Mikey, Kembe trappin'\nHella love for Chance The Rapper\nWe know 10 Day is a classic, on God\n\nAnd I just want to roll with my windows down\nAnd I just want to roll with my windows down\n\nThis is for sand in my shoes, shout out to Oak Street\nFor the free train rides, shout out to Polk Street\nTo the ice cream man you just on hella dirt\nHow you don't see us can't hear us, you Helen Keller\nBut I'mma save my dollars for Mary Jane and embellish her\nInhalin' her, smellin' her, maybe sellin' her\nYou niggas got cold feet, shouts to Luke Helliker\nBut that's my homie, my dude be droppin' hella verses\nSo, shouts to D.O.C. and Nu Tribe too\nMan we out this jam, see how new guys do\nBut its still save money like a coupon\nSo you can catch me off of the Ave gettin' my stoop on\n\nAnd I just want to roll with my windows down\nAnd I just want to roll with my windows down"}}, {"title": "Wonderful Everyday: Arthur", "album": null, "year": "2014-07-30", "lyrics": "It could be (It could be, it could be everyday)\nEveryday (It could be
