front of ya\nI hear the snakes hiss, talkin reckless\nThought I'd let it go and I wouldn't stress it\nHaters in the street, y'all worse than the press is\nAnd they all wanna hang like the charm on my necklace\nI guess things just ain't the same for gangsters\nHow a snitch nigga make a record called \"Wankstas\"\nEverything these haters do just to degrade ya\nOnly made me strong, I say thanks for the favor\nNow the D.A., wanna give me time in the feds\nI'm from Brooklyn, I could do that time on my head\nCome down with my weave straight sittin on bread\nAt the gate, gettin picked up in a new Coupe {?}\n\n\"It's all good\" - If you drivin or ridin the bus\n\"It's all good\" - In the struggle and the times is tough\n\"It's all good\" - It don't matter you can ride with us\n\"It's all good\" - It's all good\n\"It's all good\" - If you hustlin and huggin the block\n\"It's all good\" - Workin 9 to 5, punchin the clock\n\"It's all good\" - It don't matter how you get that guap\n\"It's all good\" - It's all good\n\nSee I know how it feel to wake up fucked up\nPockets broke as hell, my nigga need bail\nIt's been a couple weeks and he been sittin' in a cell\nThe only way to reach him through phone calls and mail\nBalloons stuffed with luh up in the chocha\nNow my man in the can gettin' money and gettin' high\nHe used to keep my fly he had the 6 I had the 5\nSo you know a chick gon' ride or die for her guy\nAt age 14 I was puttin' on weight\nAt age 16 I was movin' the weight\nGettin paid for drivin' state to state\nSmugglin' weight, prayin I don't bump into Jake\nI travelled through a few places with the burners\nIn the suitcases, thank God for Big\nDamn right I love the life I live\nCause I went from negative to positive and it's all\n\n\"It's all good\" - Niggas run around stuntin and frontin\n\"It's all good\" - Talkin shit but ain't sayin nuttin\n\"It's all good\" - It's aight cause they time is comin\n\"It's all good\" - It's all good\n\"It's all good\" - They hatin on me but they copy my style\n\"It's all good\" - Cracked a smile when they saw me on trial\n\"It's all good\" - You know you can't keep a good bitch down\n\"It's all good\" - It's all good\n\nCowards huff and puff but won't blow shit down\nI come through like two airplanes in midtown\nNigga my get back's the get down\nHit the big nigga first and make the rest sit down\nThey all talk loud, when they see you they quiet down\nFaggots violated I wish they'd try now\nJust watch how they bitch up, story start to switch up\nPunks gettin left off right where I pick up\nPicture in Vogue, Spring/Summer issue\nShoot game official like a ref with a whistle\nYou know when I do it I'm doin it monumental\nLeave you speechless kinda like an instrumental\nThey ask me if I know what true happiness\nDo I ever feel regret for all the things I did?\nHell no I love the life I live\nCause I went from negative to positive and it's all", "image":

utter, I feel strictly gutter\nThat's why I touch more green than Tiger's putter\nSo you mad motherfuckers mutter what you wanna\nI ain't worried 'bout none of ya and I'll say it in front of ya\nI hear the snakes hiss, talkin reckless\nThought I'd let it go and I wouldn't stress it\nHaters in the street, y'all worse than the press is\nAnd they all wanna hang like the charm on my necklace\nI guess things just ain't the same for gangsters\nHow a snitch nigga make a record called \"Wankstas\"\nEverything these haters do just to degrade ya\nOnly made me strong, I say thanks for the favor\nNow the D.A., wanna give me time in the feds\nI'm from Brooklyn, I could do that time on my head\nCome down with my weave straight sittin on bread\nAt the gate, gettin picked up in a new Coupe {?}\n\n\"It's all good\" - If you drivin or ridin the bus\n\"It's all good\" - In the struggle and the times is tough\n\"It's all good\" - It don't matter you can ride with us\n\"It's all good\" - It's all good\n\"It's all good\" - If you hustlin and huggin the block\n\"It's all good\" - Workin 9 to 5, punchin the clock\n\"It's all good\" - It don't matter how you get that guap\n\"It's all good\" - It's all good\n\nSee I know how it feel to wake up fucked up\nPockets broke as hell, my nigga need bail\nIt's been a couple weeks and he been sittin' in a cell\nThe only way to reach him through phone calls and mail\nBalloons stuffed with luh up in the chocha\nNow my man in the can gettin' money and gettin' high\nHe used to keep my fly he had the 6 I had the 5\nSo you know a chick gon' ride or die for her guy\nAt age 14 I was puttin' on weight\nAt age 16 I was movin' the weight\nGettin paid for drivin' state to state\nSmugglin' weight, prayin I don't bump into Jake\nI travelled through a few places with the burners\nIn the suitcases, thank God for Big\nDamn right I love the life I live\nCause I went from negative to positive and it's all\n\n\"It's all good\" - Niggas run around stuntin and frontin\n\"It's all good\" - Talkin shit but ain't sayin nuttin\n\"It's all good\" - It's aight cause they time is comin\n\"It's all good\" - It's all good\n\"It's all good\" - They hatin on me but they copy my style\n\"It's all good\" - Cracked a smile when they saw me on trial\n\"It's all good\" - You know you can't keep a good bitch down\n\"It's all good\" - It's all good\n\nCowards huff and puff but won't blow shit down\nI come through like two airplanes in midtown\nNigga my get back's the get down\nHit the big nigga first and make the rest sit down\nThey all talk loud, when they see you they quiet down\nFaggots violated I wish they'd try now\nJust watch how they bitch up, story start to switch up\nPunks gettin left off right where I pick up\nPicture in Vogue, Spring/Summer issue\nShoot game official like a ref with a whistle\nYou know when I do it I'm doin it monumental\nLeave you speechless kinda like an instrumental\nThey ask me if I know what true happiness\nDo I ever feel regret for all the things I did?\nHell no I love the life I live\nCause I went from negative to positive and it's all"}}, {"title": "Answering Machine Skit 1", "album":

hit the streets\nEven though I'm her niece, she copped me a piece\nWack-ass caliber, nickel-plated with the silencer\nWhat? She don't know I like my guns pretty?\nLike my boy Castor Troy with the twin-glizzies\nI heard a knock at the door {*knock knock knock knock knock*}\nTo my surprise I saw these two familiar eyes\nWho are you?\nWhattup? I'm Shanice, don't remember me?\nShe called me by my government name, Kimberly\nWho sent you?\nMy mom sent me; her name is Dottie\nShe packed a note in my knapsack along with a shottie\nHmmph, she was cute; and mad fly\nShe had the Prada knapsack, with the hat to match\nBvlgari hiking boots, with the mink bubblegoose\nAnd I could see she was admiring my mink ski suit\nThen she handed me the note\nHere, read this\nI just stared her up and down\n'Cause I couldn't believe this, then I opened it\nIt said, \"Bitches is out to get you\nYour so-called friends, put a bomb in your Benz\nI'm on a mission now to do some harm to your friends\nThey know where you live, so evacuate the crib\nAnd oh, the little girl, that's your cousin Shanice\nSince I can't be with her, I need you to babysit her\nBesides she looks up to you, you're her idol\nAnd tomorrow is her first violin recital\nAnd she would be, more than happy if you could take her\nPeace, my number's on the back of the paper, hit me later\"\nDamn, what went wrong?\nCan't we all just get along, and make hit songs?\nBitches all up in my ass like a thong\nIf this was a show, y'all hoes would get \"gonged\"\n'Cause if it's on, then it's on, bring it on\nWhat the fuck you waitin' for? C'mon, let's get it on\nWhat? What's takin you so long? I got plans for the future\nTo bring back your head like Medusa\n\nGirls be actin' stink, and mad funny\nY'all bitches bleed like me, on the monthly\nCan't stand the pain then pop a \"Humphrey\"\nI know it hurts (I'm killin' ya)\nGirls be actin' stink, and mad funny\nY'all bitches bleed like me, on the monthly\nCan't stand the pain then pop a \"Humphrey\"\nI know it hurts (I'm killin' ya)\n\nUhh, we in the Range in this fucked up weather\nIt's snowin' and I'm tryin' to put the whole shit together\nHow Laverne, she always wanted to be like me\nAnd dress like me, and look like me\nAnd Nicole, it's like she lived in my house\nAskin me for money, day in - day out\nAnd last but not least the grimiest one Tayesha\nShe planned it all, come to find out her name is Keisha\nC'mon Shanice I'm takin' you to my house in L. Conn\n(I wanna go with you!) Uhh, be quiet, and we'll get along fine\nC'mon please, I wanna be just like you\n600 Mercedes, and 380's in my doll babies\nCrazy baguettes in my barettes and\nH-class rocks inside my Baby G Shock\nFuck Barney and Lambchops; I don't love them hoes!\nBut anything goes when it comes to bankrolls\nDiamonds on my toes, X-and-O's\nVersace hottie in designer clothes\nScoop Lil' Nique and Jus, then take 'em to Toys'R'Us\nMake em spend they cheese then kick 'em out and take the bus\nI'm the S-the-H-the-A-the-N-the-I-the-C-the-E\nBut all my friends call me Miss Little Queen Bee\nWhat what? I like the green, know what I mean?\nEver seen The Professional? (uh-huh) Well I can clean\nYou know what? I like you, little big person\nBut rule number one, no cursin'\nAnyway, what you know about that?\nYou too young for that, when I was your age\nI woulda got hung for that\nThen I picked up the phone, to call my Aunt Dot\nSo she could fill me in a little more about the plot\nHmm.. nine-one-seven, eight-five-eight, two-one-two-two\n\"Hello?\" Yo, what's the deal?\nWhy these bitches buggin' out;\nI mean, what's this all about?\n\"See it's sorta like what Tonya Harding did to Nancy\nThey don't want you to win no more\nSoul Train they don't want you to attend no more\nAnd I guess that's why, they ain't your friends no more\nThe other day, when I was comin' out the grocery store\nI saw the bitch Nicole in front of the salon next door\"\nFor real? \"Yup, then I choked the bitch out\nAt least one to the heart, tied up her hands and feet\nThrough her in my backseat\nThen I dumped her on a dead-end street\nThe other two? Yeah they still linger\nBut don't you lift a finger, I'ma get 'em\nSo just pray I come home\nAnd when we hang up, get rid of your phone\"\nWhoo! When Aunt Dot comes, oh brother\nIt's like five Bloody Mary's, one after another\nHmmph, she have you stressed, no wearin' white, no sex\nAnd when she get vexed, you guess what happens next\n'Cause them other two girls, that's still on the menu\nIs the reason why the story is to be continued\n\nGirls be actin' stink, and mad funny\nY'all bitches bleed like me, on the monthly\nCan't stand the pain then pop a \"Humphrey\"\nI know it hurts (I'm killin' ya)\nGirls be actin' stink, and mad funny\nY'all bitches bleed like me, on the monthly\nCan't stand the pain then pop a \"Humphrey\"\nI know it hurts (I'm killin' ya)"}}, {"title": "Bad Girls", "album": "The Notorious K.I.M.

shoutout to my girl Victoria Gotti and the whole family stay up\n\nThis time around I ain't takin no shit, this time around I never get bit\nThis time around I switched up my flow\nGot rid of the pits and put rotts by the do'\nThis time around it ain't like befo'\nThis time around I'm gon' crack ya jaw\nThe feds is watchin me so I can't do much\nSpeak the wrong words bitch and you will get touched\nI'm back on the scene my favorite color is green\nI'm buildin a empire got a whole new team\nPimp game is strong, raps is just harder than they ever been\nYou can never win\nMade my way through Hollywood fashion world adores me\nMusic's my first love a nine to five bores me\nLove me or hate me Lil Kim come through\nMy fans across the world I came back for you\n\nI came back for you\nAll incarcerated scarfaces gangstas with the fed cases\nI came back for you, all my fans across the world holla at your girl\nI came back for you\nEverybody's waitin on me all these bitches hatin on me\nI came back for you, the mink rockin Benz coppin keep the bottles poppin\n\nIt's the real hip hop mami check the facts\nI'm sick of all you acts with your bubble gum raps\nLike the sand in the hour glass you out of your time\nTried to go against the queen is you out of your mind?\nEven be at number two, your chances is slim\nCause when God made Adam, he should've made Kim\nI gave a few passes but I never forget\nIt's enough I got to put up with this Doo Doo Brown chick\nNow you and you wanna come at me from all sides\nI'm gettin money, don't think I just be lettin shit slide\nI'm very concerned with fashion ain't my fault y'all don't know how ta\nRock this Hollyhood thang y'all need to let me style ya\nCome back, to the light ma, I started the shit\nHow soon we forget I'm the heart of the shit\nSo keep your tacky ways and go back to your stripper days\nAs long as I'm around, you gon' bow down\n\nI came back for you\nAll incarcerated scarfaces gangstas with the fed cases\nI

thang\nCause I'm the best that ever done it, the best that lived it\nI ain't no overnight success goddamnit I was born with it\nThe Prada mama, the Dolce and Gabbana drippin\nThe Blue Hypnotic Martini Mimosa sippin\nY'all better team or get it together\nOr you, you and her can get it whenever\nHuh, I got a army y'all can't harm me\nIf the show was on the other foot you probably try to starve

Mafia\nOh, shoutout to my girl Victoria Gotti and the whole family stay up\n\nThis time around I ain't takin no shit, this time around I never get bit\nThis time around I switched up my flow\nGot rid of the pits and put rotts by the do'\nThis time around it ain't like befo'\nThis time around I'm gon' crack ya jaw\nThe feds is watchin me so I can't do much\nSpeak the wrong words bitch and you will get touched\nI'm back on the scene my favorite color is green\nI'm buildin a empire got a whole new team\nPimp game is strong, raps is just harder than they ever been\nYou can never win\nMade my way through Hollywood fashion world adores me\nMusic's my first love a nine to five bores me\nLove me or hate me Lil Kim come through\nMy fans across the world I came back for you\n\nI came back for you\nAll incarcerated scarfaces gangstas with the fed cases\nI came back for you, all my fans across the world holla at your girl\nI came back for you\nEverybody's waitin on me all these bitches hatin on me\nI came back for you, the mink rockin Benz coppin keep the bottles poppin\n\nIt's the real hip hop mami check the facts\nI'm sick of all you acts with your bubble gum raps\nLike the sand in the hour glass you out of your time\nTried to go against the queen is you out of your mind?\nEven be at number two, your chances is slim\nCause when God made Adam, he should've made Kim\nI gave a few passes but I never forget\nIt's enough I got to put up with this Doo Doo Brown chick\nNow you and you wanna come at me from all sides\nI'm gettin money, don't think I just be lettin shit slide\nI'm very concerned with fashion ain't my fault y'all don't know how ta\nRock this Hollyhood thang y'all need to let me style ya\nCome back, to the light ma, I started the shit\nHow soon we forget I'm the heart of the shit\nSo keep your tacky ways and go back to your stripper days\nAs long as I'm around, you gon' bow down\n\nI came back for you\nAll incarcerated scarfaces gangstas with the fed cases\nI came back for you, all my fans across the world holla at your girl\nI came back for you\nEverybody's waitin on me all these bitches hatin on me\nI came back for you, the mink rockin Benz coppin keep the bottles poppin\n\nThis time around either your in or your out\nThis time around you better watch your mouth\nThis time around you gon' hang or bang\nThis time around you better do your thang\nCause I'm the best that ever done it, the best that lived it\nI ain't no overnight success goddamnit I was born with it\nThe Prada mama, the Dolce and Gabbana drippin\nThe Blue Hypnotic Martini Mimosa sippin\nY'all better team or get it together\nOr you, you and her can get it whenever\nHuh, I got a army y'all can't harm me\nIf the show was on the other foot you probably try to starve me\nDon't get your life tooken I know I got you shooken\nThis Bed Stuy fly girl came back for Brooklyn"}}, {"title": "Can't Fuck With Queen Bee", "album": "La Bella Mafia", "year": "2003-03-04",

Gang}, I.R.S\nYou are now rocking with the best, yeah\n[Verse 1: Lil Kim}\nKeep the champagne coming all night, that's my motto\nTo everybody in the crowd got they own bottle\nNails done, hair done, manicured toes\nThey still on them pink bottles, we on that ice roll\nYeah, that's that new shit\nBottles all white, like Obama's crib\nAnd they still talking old gold\nI just netted half a mil' from some old gold\nRalph Lauren Polo, that be the logo\nDom P, Ace of Spades, Veuve Cliquot\nChampagne bath and a champagne glass\nI piss champagne, that's my campaign ad\nI.R.S we the M.V.P.s of the year\nSee them sparkles in the air, know they coming over here\nWe poppin' ros\u00e9, like it's Independence Day\nEven though it's more bottles on the way\n\nI'ma need more champagne\nTell the waitress grab a couple more bottles and bring 'em up\nWe got a bar for every nigga that came with us\nYou got some broads, then bring 'em up\nGrab a drink and get fucked up\nChampagne\nSee them bottles of ros\u00e9 when they think of us\nWe just all up in the club to spend paper up\nWhat you hating for, get the waitress bruh\nI'ma need --\n\nUh, and I'm still talkin' champagne\nGood weed, bad bitches and airplanes\nNiggas get extra like spare change\nLeave ya bitch 'round my gang, then she fair game\nGet so hot, you standing near a flame\n20 thousand on my wrist, 50 on my chain\nClub owners mad we drinkin' all the ros\u00e9\nAnd niggas hate but I just go off what the hoes say\nHe a skinny nigga, but he do it big\nYeah it's lookin' like a movie but it's how I live\nYoung boss, Taylor Gang general\nDrinkin' out the pink bottle, Ros\u00e9 Imperial\nAnd my bad bitch look like a centrefold\nCook like a chef, smoke like it's medicinal\nSmell the engine burnin', you hear my tyres murk\nWe be poppin' corks like fireworks\n(I'ma need more champagne)\nVIP is full of red bottles\nIn the city that I come from, I'm the head honcho\nOunces full of kush, bottles full of Mo\u00ebt\nSee me in my yellow car, she got so wet\nUsed to smoke blunts, now she roll planes\nQuit fuckin' with her nigga, he was so lame\nSays she love the taste, but she don't know the name\nDrinkin' by the case, I gon' need you to bring (more champagne)\nI'm with my goons gettin' liquored up\nMake this money then blow it, like I don't give a fuck\nShow up to the club, they brought them bottles out\nYou gettin' paper, you should know just what I'm talkin' 'bout\nUh, I live the life you write a song about\nBitches think I'm famous, favours come in large amounts\nStanding on the table, standing on the couch\nSomebody tell the waitress that we almost out\n\nI'ma need more champagne\nTell the waitress grab a couple more bottles and bring 'em up\nWe got a bar for every nigga that came with us\nYou got some broads, then bring 'em up\nGrab a drink and get fucked up\nChampagne\nSee them bottles of ros\u00e9 when they think of us\nWe just all up in the club to spend paper up\nWhat you hating for, get

eyein' Cease\nComin' backstage, dyin' to get pleased\nYou got me, I rock thee, Versace and linen\nWhile you stop your grinnin' wit' bunch of foxy women\nWhy you speed ball with cards, that's invalid\nI get clothes, custom made, from a stylist\nCruise in my Lexus Land with no mileage\nWhile you walk the street until your feet get calloused\nTake you on a natural high, like a pilot\nIt be all good, toss your clothes like a salad\nWhen it's all over, put your vote in my ballot\nIt's my diner, I'm Mel, and you're Alice\nSpend a night, in Lil' Cease palace\nIt be all good as long as you don't act childish\nWhile you standin' there with the Crist' in your cup\nIf worse come to worse keep this on the hush, uhh\n\nI know you seen me on the video (true)\nI know you heard me on the radio (true)\nBut you still don't pay me no attention\nListenin' to what your girlfriends mention\nHe's a slut, he's a ho, he's a freak\nGot a different girl every day of the week\nIt's cool, not tryin' to put a rush on you\nI had to let you know that I got a crush on you\n\nAyo shorty, won't you go get a bag of the lethal\nI'll be undressed in the bra all see through\nWhy you count your jewels thinkin' I'ma cheat you?\nThe only one thing I wanna do is freak you\nKeep your stone sets, I got my own baguettes\nAnd I'll be doin' things that you won't regret\nLil Kim, the Queen Bee, so you best take heed\nShall I proceed? (Yes indeed!)\nI'ma throw shade if I can't get paid\nBlow you up to your girl like the Army grenade\nYou can slide on my ice like the Escapade\nAnd itchy-gitchy-yaya with the marmalade\nWho me? Not you, oh yes, who's he?\nI even dig yo' man's style, but I love yo' profile\nWhisper in your ear and get you all shook up\nBut don't blush, just keep this on the hush\n\nI know you seen me on the video (true)\nI know you heard me on the radio (true)\nBut you still don't pay me no attention\nListenin' to what your girlfriends mention\nHe's a slut, he's a ho, he's a freak\nGot a different girl every day of the week\nIt's cool, not tryin' to put a rush on you\nI had to let you know that I got a crush on you\n\nWhile you tryin' to catch Sea Breeze, I'm in the PV's\nAll chrome D3's, decked out TV's\nCD's with crazy bass, keep my lady laced\nDon't be fooled by the baby face\nI hope ya not, 'cause your thighs got me hot\nOnly one plan, that's to rise to the top\nI told you before, when I first pursued\nI want a interlude, in the nude\n\nYou know I love the way you feel-a, sip my tequil-a\nWorks from the dealers, full-length chinchilla\nHeat up the clutch, seven-fifty deluxe\nThen we speed down the hutch, breakin' trees in the dutch\nI'm not the one you sleep wit', to eat quick\nWant a cheap trick, better go down to FreakNik\nYou got to hit me off, buy this girl gifts of course\nSo I look sick, in my six, with my Christian LaCroix\n\nI know you seen me on the video (true)\nI know you heard me on the radio (true)\nBut you still don't pay me no attention\nListenin' to what your girlfriends mention\nHe's a slut, he's a ho, he's a freak\nGot a different girl every day of the week\nIt's cool, not tryin' to put a rush on you\nI had to let you know that I got a crush on you\n\nI know you seen me on the video (true)\nI know you heard me on the radio (true)\nBut you still don't pay me no attention\nListenin' to what your girlfriends mention\nHe's a slut, he's a ho, he's a freak\nGot a different girl every day of the week\nIt's cool, not tryin' to put a rush on you\nI had to let you know that I got a crush on you\n\nI know you seen me on the video (true)\nI know you heard me on the radio (true)\nBut you still don't pay me no attention\nListenin' to what your girlfriends mention\nHe's a slut, he's a ho, he's a freak\nGot a different girl every day of the week\nIt's cool, not tryin' to put a rush on you\nI had to let you know that I got a crush on you\n\nI know you seen me on the video (true)\nI know you heard me on the radio (true)\nBut you still don't pay me no attention\nListenin' to what your girlfriends mention\nHe's a slut, he's a ho, he's a freak\nGot a different girl every day of the week\nIt's cool, not tryin' to put a rush on you\nI had to let you know that I got a crush on you"}}, {"title": "Custom Made (Give It to You)", "album": "The Notorious K.I.M.", "year": "2000-06-27", "lyrics": "Uh, uh\n\nI gets right to the point (no time to play around)\nWhen it comes to this cheddar (lay a nigga down)\nBust shots at his Rover if he dare come back around\nPay me on time or I gots to take mine\nAt first I seem friendly but that's just in me\nI warn you, when I blow, it gets a little windy\nYou make me wanna fight you, I ain't nothin' like you\nY'all paper thin, my shit recycled\nThey call me Lil' Kim a.k.a.

before you made me your wife\nShoppin' sprees and puttin' money in my pockets\nPictures of you inside my heart-shaped lockets\nAnd my girls, knew you wasn't no good\nThey told me 'bout them broads you was fuckin in the hood\nYou said I was a diamond, and you was like a pearl\nSo daddy how could you do this to your baby girl?\nMemories, is all it brings when I look at my rings\nAnd \"Heartbreaker\"

you wanna dump me?\nAnd just to think, I was about to have a baby for you\nAnd then some bitch you was fuckin said she was havin' one too?\nYou wrong!

that's that hiphop cop\nThese cheese eatin' rodents really got the game caught\nYou see when you on top, niggas want what you got\nEven though they idolize you, they still critisize you\nSo don't preach to me bout singing , I, I am just a woman\nYou've got your feelings I got mine, I'm only human\nAnd I gotta go down as a gyal who know how to get it on\nI've gotta go down as a gyal who know

pussy\nHe said he wanna hide all his racks in this pussy\nHe said he wanna put all his work in this pussy\nHe wanna put a kilo in this pussy, bitch\nI'm at the Fountain Bleu, bitch\nVen aqu\u00ed, ven aqu\u00ed to the Fountain Bleu, bitch\n\nI'm just chilling at the Fountain Bleu\nCounting chicken at the Fountain Bleu\nI'm vibing out the Fountain Bleu\nYou know I'm grinding out the Fountain Bleu

business, nigga\nA wealthy gutta bitch out of public housing\nWhere we scream fuck the other side, no arousement\nChanel lil boy 250 wildin', I'm talking $250,000\nSpent a wraith off in Neiman Marcus\nI should get paid to shop at Neiman Marcus\nAnd my closet's a Givenchy jungle\nExotic Animals, that's Ferragamo\nI got a ostrich I named her Birkin\nI know it's hurtin', ya man made my last purchase\nRan off on ya nigga twice, he steady calling I ain't calling back\nI don't pick up my phone unless it's about them racks\nMajor key alert\nMake sure you secure them bags\nHe texted my phone and said he got a bag\nI picked my best friend up and hit the nigga back\nHe pulled a ring out, couple chains out\nI fucked his brains out, at his mane's house\nThen went and gave the jewelry to my young niggas\nCause I just love to fuck\nI don't love niggas\nHe said that he proposed on his last album\nDamn, I never heard his last album\nFuck a shooter, I got army troopers\nHella ubers and they full of boosters\n\nI'm just chilling at the Fountain Bleu\nCounting chicken at the Fountain Bleu\nI'm vibing out the Fountain Bleu\nYou know I'm grinding out the Fountain Bleu (x2)"}}, {"title":

sometimes the danger taste delicious\nRule number three; don't take love from no bitches\nYou know what makes me much stronger than you\nI can take pain much longer than you\nSo what you gon' do when

get to gettin yours\nThrow your bottles in the sky if you're gettin yours\nIf that other bitch's ass ain't as big as yours\nYou gettin money what'chu hatin on my bitches for?\nHey get your mind off of mine and get to gettin yours\n\nBoss lady pull up in the back of the Maybach\nChaffeur behind the wheel, feet up, leaned back\nReadin the newspaper, honeygirl put a hurtin on 'em\nHaters like a bad act, I just close the curtain on 'em\nPlay all day on the Siruis, radio\nSatellite TV, who do it like me?\nIn designer outfits, while sellin the tag\nYves Saint Laurent boots, Yves Saint Laurent bag\nKeep the Pokeman in case a big bitch think I'm ass\nEatin through her stomach like a gastric, bypass\nBitch you better buy a pass and you better have the cash\nWhen you in my town you got to see me to buy a pass\nNumber one rule, think B.I.G\n50 grand for the girl to sit in V.I.P\nThe spotlight is on me, I'm the one they wanna see\nThey give they money to Kim like I'm H.S.B.C\n\nYeah, well it's young Dash to all those who don't know\nThe boy who stay hot when his jewels is so cold\nKiller screwface and he cockin that fo'-fo'\nWanna ice grill? Better holla at Paul Wall\nIs all that called for? Whole crew do it up\nChampagne, threw it up, 'til niggas threw it up\nCruisin up, tinted up, gotta be some star\nDon't know what to call it, they say it's a truck car\nYou been with a chump pah; like Ashton\nWas the first one to \"Punk\" y'all\nHave yo' ass holy and resemblin Spongebob\nLike an old album, you happen to come for us\nYou guys get dust off\nIt's the young boss, show you what the imp us for\nFamily and friends be the only ones missin boy\nSayin that you rich and all, tell me what'chu bitchin for\nMaybe cause I'm gettin mine - well is you gettin yours?\n\n\nYou don't really want it with the nigga right in front of Tip\nHave you duckin on the shit, wanna let the burner spit\nGet bucked bitch, give a fuck who you run and get\nKing of the South, Pimp Squad Clique runnin shit\nBricks in the pipeline, sold in the nighttime\nTake a lifetime to find a flow that's quite like mine\n40 cal's and 45 Glocks, I don't like nine\nMac-9 and automatic flatten niggas lifeline\nI'm already rich, use the rappin as a pasttime\nGrand Hustle bitch and I ain't settle for the last time\nOther niggas settle down cause I don't bag mine\nYou see me pull it I'mma blast, I don't flash mine\nYou niggas livin check to check but I don't cash mine\nDeposit it and let it sit cause all the cash mine\nBeen goin easy on you rappers I'mma mash now\nNiggas throw your bottles in the air and put the glass down"}}, {"title": "Gimme Brain", "album": "Black Friday", "year": "2011-02-14", "lyrics": "Yeah\nStep into my rainforest\nStep into my rainforest\nYeah only for the sexy people\nStep

too nasty\nClothes too tight and my ass too sassy\nI'm a love goddess haven't you heard?\nJehovah's my witness, spread the word\nAnd all scrubs get kicked to the curb\nBefore you holla at me throw a few dollars at me\nI see you got a brick in your pants\nWould you like a table dance?\nThe boss lady make you pay for the sex\nThen shake my ass like I'm at a Greekfest\nNo cash, I take Traveler's Checks\nFor an extra five g's you can have my address\nThe things I do I take a real risk\nA lot of people think that I'm a real bitch\nDon't judge me by the words of this song\nCause the media, they got me figured out wrong\n\nI don't want anybody to get the wrong idea about me\nI ain't got nothing to hide, my pussy ain't for free\nJust like the Benz I drive you out of your mind\nSome people think that I'm nasty, I just like having a good time\n\nYo, yo, yo\nYo that single life shit, that be me\nFront ass at the bar, where the chickens be?\nGot two hoes, Tonya and Tiffany\nFinger in the drawers and we downin' Henessy\nThen I hit the door slide to the ride\nNow I'm gettin' head in the Q-45\nThat's LV, minors is six and up\nWith the big atennas that be sittin' up\nI'm livin' it up, drink Cris, piss in the cup\nWith a bunch of birds that with it to fuck\nI love life (no doubt)\nSo fuck a ho and a wife\nPeace and love to all my sluts and my dikes\nCease never treat a bitch nice\nI wanna bitch that smoke and don't get an appetite\nI fuck to die cause my mom fucked for me\nThat's why my niggas never sling dick for free\nFeel me?\n\nI don't want anybody to get the wrong idea about Cease\nI have no love for hoes, my dick just ain't for free\nI keep a lot of pussy on my mind\nSome people think that I'm nasty\nI just like fucking all the time\n\nSee some niggas do, and some niggas don't\nPay for the pussy, some niggas won't\nSee, I ain't the type that can say \"I Don't\"\nOnce the bitch see the six, I ain't gotta do shit\n\nYou can be Cash and I'll be Tango\nBingo, you know just how this thang go\nNiggas wanna get with me without the ching-ching dough\nThe Green Bling flow, I don't think so\n\nI jumps out like \"Biotch! Who the fuck you with?\"\nOn some real Jigga shit, haters suck my dick\nIf you out for the ones then out come the guns\nOnce I call the duns, then out come the slugs\n\nI got an island name Queen Bee\nAnd a dog that's a Pickingese\nWhat you call romancing, don't tickle my fantasy\nPut your money where your mouth is, talk is cheap\nBuy me a country and a monkey, or don't even come to me\n\n\n\nQueen Bee\nLil' Cease"}}, {"title": "Grindin' Makin' Money", "album": "Black Friday", "year": "2011-02-14", "lyrics": "This my nine-to-five\nStill livin' all that I like (Shit was all good just a couple years ago)\nGrindin' makin' money (Haha)\nGrindin' makin' money (Birdman, featuring Lil Kim, Nicki Minaj)\nGrindin' makin' money (It's called Grindin' gettin' money)\nGrindin' makin' money (Let's go)\n\nI'm grindin' all day, gettin money\nDamn, it take all day to count the money\nI'm in the freezer, neck full of icicles\nI'm a dime, you other chicas need a nickel\nWho that in the Phantom?

Creator of all things\nI humble myself... As I bow to the throne\nI pray for love, joy, peace and happiness\n\nI pray for love... I pray for love...\nI pray for love, joy, peace and happiness\n\nThey say the closest ones to ya\nBe the ones that sneak up behind ya and stick the knife through ya\nThat's why now I keep my friends to a minimum\nCheck for the ones wit the venom on they tongue\n'Cuz niggas is snakes, they hugs be fake\nSteal from they best friend at his own wake\nI did all I can do and I took all I can take\nThis is it, crossin' me was ya biggest mistake\nAnd was it enough that I split 20% of what I make?\nWas it enough that I cut niggas half of what I bake?\nAin't enough that I almost lost all my bread\nBailin niggas out, keepin' a roof over our head\nEnough is enough I wash my hands I'm done wit it\nI ain't playin wit u motherfuckers come wit it\nKeep the fam together God knows I tried\nBut shit ain't been the same since B.I. died\n\n(I pray for love... I pray for love...\nI pray for love, joy, peace and happiness)\nEvery day... every night\nKeep the fam together God knows I tried\n(I pray for love... I pray for love...\nI pray for love, joy, peace and happiness)\nEvery day... and every night\nShit ain't been the same since B.I died\n\nLil' Kim the first rap bitch to shake up the charts\nAct like I ain't the leader of this Million Bitch March\nWho got y'all rockin' the Prada\nThe Gucci, Dior, Chanel, Versace and Louis\nPlease, I'm the reason this rap game is unisex\nI'm the reason bitches want bigger breasts\nShow some respect where respect is due\n(Without who?) Without me there'd be no you\nThese next few lines it to you women abusers\nLast nigga I was wit... straight fuckin' loser\nNiggas think 'cuz you give 'em ya heart\nThey can... dissect it and rip it apart\nMm-mm, not I, one nigga's in my eye\nPayback's a motherfucker, put that on the Stuy\nYou lost a good bitch nigga you can't front\nLil' Kim is EVERYthing a man could EVER want\nAnd that's real\n\n(I pray for love... I pray for love...\nI pray for love, joy, peace and happiness)\nEvery day... and every night\nMm-mm, not I, one nigga's in my eye\n(I pray for love... I pray for love...\nI pray for love, joy, peace and happiness)\nEvery day, yo... every night\nPayback's a motherfucker, put that on the Stuy\n\nWhen the... money is gone (So is ya friends)\nWhen the... gas runs out (there goes ya Benz)\nThey just don't make my breed no more\nNobody lives by the code of the street no more\nI don't deal wit the nonsense, I'm keepin' it real\nWanna do business wit me? Get in touch wit Hill\n\nThat's right any questions? No you can't ask me\nPut ya name and ya number on a letterhead and fax me\nU want Kim? Name the location\n75 grand and that's just for conversation\n\nI'mma remain loyal while y'all crumble like the foil\nIt's tradition to rock diamonds in my crown, I'm royal\nNiggas ain't believe in me, they thought it was over\nBaby girl risin' up like the early mornin' sun\nY'all think y'all know but y'all have no idea\nWhat the fuck I been goin' through these last 7 years\n\n(I pray for love... I pray for love...\nI pray for love, joy, peace and happiness)\nEvery day, yo... and every night\nThey just don't make my breed no more\nWord, that's it... (I pray for love... )(Every day, yo)\n(I pray for love) I'm the last of the Mohicans...\n(and every night) after me\nThere will be none... (I pray for love...)\n(I pray for love, joy, peace and happiness)... and every night\nNobody lives by the code of the street no more\n\nI'm sayin... I just wanna be happy, that's all I don't ask for much\nIt makes me happy to see my people smile you know what I'm sayin\nI ain't a hater, I don't even like sayin' the word\n(Nobody lives by the code of the street no more)\nI'd sacrifice everything I got right now to have my man Biggie here wit me\nYou see that's just how I am\n'Cuz I'm a rider (Keep the fam together god knows I tried)\nWhat good is it to have everything\nIf you can't share it with the one you love?\nIf you can't be wit the ones you love... then love the ones you wit\nDon't take nobody for granted\nYou ain't promised tomorrow\nKarma's a motherfucker\nI'm appreciative (Payback's a motherfucker, put that on the Stuy)\nLa Bella Mafia 2003...

big ass dick and a hurricane tongue\n\nSo, how many licks does it take 'til you get to the center of the?\n('Cause I've got to know)\nHow many licks does it take 'til you get to the center of

failure has not stopped her\nTake it from me, the queen of all queens\nWomen are taking over for the new millennium, haw!\nWhat the hell do you want from me?\nI'm just tryna be all that I can be\nI'm a god damn legacy\nThanks to B.I.G. and Puff Daddy\nThe first lady runs the world now\nThey impeached the president from his residence\nNo one drops bombs 'til I say so\nOne, two, one, two, three, go!\n\nI'm human, you're human\nSo they said but inside we're all animals\nI'm human, you're human\nSo they said but inside we're all animals\n\nHow dare you accuse me and my family\nFucking clones, leave us alone!\nMe and Puff is like Janet and Mike\nYou make us wanna (scream), know what I mean?\n(Yeah, yeah) I know y'all rather see us dead\nNo more platinum plaques certified lead\nWe got too many chips for y'all\nQueen Bee, Queen Bee make hits for y'all\nTake a deep breath\nInhale, exhale 'til there's no more left\nIn the name of the father, son, and daughter\nHere comes the new world order!\nYou can't stop it\nMother Earth this my universe\nWhen worse comes to worse (uh huh)\nI call the shots (uh huh), stack all the lots (uh huh)\nPack all the Glocks, take the safety off lock, fire!\n\nI'm human, you're human\nSo they said but inside we're all animals\nI'm human, you're human\nSo they said but inside we're all animals\n\nAh, la-la-lah\nThat la-lah, la-lah (sing!)\nAh, la-la-lah\nThat la-lah, la-lah (huh, huh!)\nAh, la-la-lah\nThat la-lah, la-lah\nWe love that la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-lah!\n\nCan I jingle it, baby? Go 'head, baby\nCan I jingle it, baby? Go 'head, baby (hmm)\nTake it out, let me sit on it\nYou can't make it wet, just spit on it\nAh don't stop 'til it rise to the top\nPromise you won't drop 'til the cherry go (pop)\nAnd if it doesn't fit then use your lips\nOh, here it comes, what's my name? Queen Bitch!\n\nI'm human, you're human\nSo they said but inside we're all animals\nI'm human, you're human\nSo they said but inside we're all animals\n\nAh, la-la-lah\nThat la-lah, la-lah (sing!)\nAh, la-la-lah\nThat la-lah, la-lah (huh, huh!)\nAh, la-la-lah\nThat la-lah, la-lah\nWe love that la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-lah!"}}, {"title": "In the Air Tonite", "album": "Urban Renewal:

real shit\nY'all just playin the greatest like Will Smith\nI kill 'em with kindness, blow a lil kiss\nLook like you gotta weak bladder, you a lil pissed\nUh, but it ain't my fault, the queen never left\nI don't know what y'all thought\nRight back to ballin'\nGettin' money is sport\nAnd i always tell the truth even when I'm in court\nNew York, it ain't New York\nGo on show off, drop the top on that Porsche\nIf everyday ya hustlin' like Rick Ross\nThen you get it like a boss\nNo matter what it cost\nLil Kim that's more than a lil bit\nTell a nigga quit\nGo 'head wit' ya lil dick\nWit' ya lil money, lil ice, and ya lil whip\nYou already know I'm in love with that big shit\nBut it ain't my fault, the queen never left\nI don't know what y'all thought\nRight back to ballin'\nGettin' money is

go 'head with that lil shit\nUh, I'm throwin' money in the crowd\nThe way I make it rain\nMake ya fuck around and drown\nNow them leaches ain't around\nI'm better off alone\nGot rid of the dead

start you gotta know your part\nYou can't miss me at night, I glow in the dark\nLook baby, I'm a rockstar, no guitar\nYoung, fly nigga shades on like Bret Hart\nShaMoney gets more than a lil dome\nQuick to tell a bitch go and kick it like a field goal\nI don't need a super woman, I just need a lil more\nLil cris, lil haze, and a lil dro\nAnd I'm cooler than an A/C breeze\nStill stomp a nigga out in my ACGs\nStill run up in ya crib through that ADT\nASAP where that money at\nIf I don't do nothing, I'ma ball\nI'ma go and get that duffle bag\nI ain't never ran from a nigga, I ain't a runnin' back\nMike Vick ya dog, ya better muzzle that\nDang nigga, you soak a nigga like a bubble bath\nYou don't want none of that\nWe be on that bullshit\nStill gettin' money man I'm good like I'm

block, get that money\nGet that money, get that money\nDon't stop huggin' the block, get that money\n\nCause I'm 'bout to own the charts\nWhen I pop my collar, man I'm extra heavy on the starch\nExtra heavy on the wheels, extra heavy on the watch\nJewelry like Henny, extra heavy on the rocks\nMy dudes on the grind, extra heavy on the block\nYou know I like my men extra heavy with the guap\nYou

coach\nYeah I came home, little meat on the thighs\nI'm eye candy, real sweet on the eyes\nYeah I fucked with Nas, hypnotized B.I\nDamn, they even thought I married Jay, like Blige\nBut nah, nah, Kim

\"Ain't Never Gon' Stop\"\nI'm always on that green light, tryna get my team right\nBack to back 5-50s, that cream white\nRed diamonds like a infrared beam light\nMy soldiers masked up like it's Halloween night\nYou know the apple-bottoms got the jeans fittin' tight\nMarciano bra got the titties sittin' right\nJT had a sexy track, but it's gon take Lil' Kim to bring sexy back\nIt's me the trendsetter, 24/7 Star sweater\n24 karat gold on Astar leather, best thing since Donetella\nWe in the club and our table's bottled up like a wine cellar\nLet's get this mozzarella, money is time fella\nThe Queen reign better get under my umbrella-ella-ella-aye-aye-aye\nIt's the Mafia La Bella-ella-ella, all day-aye, yeah\nKim still gutta mane\nAmerican Idol, before Ruben Studdard mane\nMy sex appeal make you stu-stu-stutter mane\nMy CD all in ya crib like brudda mane\nI'm seasoned with all the right spices\nI'm the whole pie, y'all just slices\nI'm hotter than Tabasco sauce\nWhen God make it rain. it's to cool me off\n\nGet that money, get that money\nDon't stop huggin' the block, get that money\nGet that money, get that money\nDon't stop huggin' the block, get that money\n\nCause I'm 'bout to own the charts\nWhen I pop my collar, man I'm extra heavy on the starch\nExtra heavy on the wheels, extra heavy on the watch\nJewelry like Henny, extra heavy on the rocks\nMy dudes on the grind, extra heavy on the block\nYou know I like my men extra heavy with the guap\nYou lookin' for the dude leavin' the club in the Gallardo\nI'm lookin' for the due leavin' in the helicopter\nSo we can toast, overlooking the coast\nJust think about that, next time you flyin' coach\nYeah I came home, little meat on the thighs\nI'm eye candy, real sweet on the eyes\nYeah I fucked with Nas, hypnotized B.I\nDamn, they even thought I married Jay, like Blige\nBut nah, nah, Kim keep two steppin'\nTwo-fo'-seven, is what I'm reppin'\nLil' Kim for mayor, fuck with a real bitch\nQueen Bee nigga, get with the real shit\nYou need a fix, I'm the one to holla at\nYa stocks went down, you can't get a dolla back"}}, {"title": "Jam It Up Some", "album": null, "year": null, "lyrics": "Listen, Its

day\n\nY'all better stand up or sit down, cause I'mma be here\nPull up a beach chair and pop you a Becks beer\nI'mma live it up, 'til I'm a hundred with gray hair\nGlass house in Bel-Air that's, high up in the mountain\nGolden gates, and the brass water fountain\n'Til my last day, I'm goin hard\nAnd I ain't slowin up, 'til the Heliport's in my back yard\n'Til my whole team sign they name on that black card\n'Til I bring New York back, 'til I show you where I'm from\n'Til I show you how it's done, show you why I'm number one\n'Til my peeps is out the hood, 'til I buy my moms a jet\n'Til I own my first island and cash a trillion dollar check\n'Til I'm at the top of Forbes' richest lookin kosher\nWith my name and my picture, right next to Oprah\nIn negotiations with Bill Gates and his broker\n'Til I'm with Jehovah it ain't over 'til it's over\n\n\nBesides God, what the fuck should I fear?\nThe only one could stop me is that chick in the mirror\nI built my career on, blood sweat and tears\nAnd I'm still here, gettin stronger each year\nCause what don't kill me, could only help build me\nI guess all that dirt just made me more filthy\nIf being loyal's a crime, then I'm so guilty\nIf you was missin a spine you'd still have to feel me\nSome came and went but your girl is everlasting\n'Til the day I'm gasping (gasping)\nAnd niggas droppin tears on my Versace casket\nAnd I'm, reunited with Big, like nigga what happened?\nShit got drastic, I missed you with a passion\nBy now they should realize I'm not the average rap chick\nAin't nuttin they could do now to stop my shine\nThis is God's plan homey, it ain't mine\n\n\nUntil my heartbeat stops, my flesh goes numb\nAnd the last breath leaves my lung, I'll be\nThe big Q.B., the problem in Prada\nThe bitch that these rap hoes wanna become\nI been hated on many times, adored and idolized\nCheck your stats, I'm all that, bottom line\nIt's all there in black and white, read it and weep\nI'm the, perfect example of keepin it street\nCause when it's all said and done and at the end of the day\nMy actions spoke louder than whatever they say\nYeah I'll rep the hood, stood the test of time\nSo a cell'll hold my body and never my mind\nSo, never mind any of y'all petty tactics\nI'm gettin fetty, movin through them tax brackets\nBitch you gotta be kiddin me, Kim's the epitome\nI'm the ghost of Big so you could

"When it's my last day, then it's my last day\nBut until that day, you can't take away\nHow they scream my name, how I pimp this game\nCritically acclaimed, until my last day\n\nY'all better stand up or sit down, cause I'mma be here\nPull up a beach chair and pop you a Becks beer\nI'mma live it up, 'til I'm a hundred with gray hair\nGlass house in Bel-Air that's, high up in the mountain\nGolden gates, and the brass water fountain\n'Til my last day, I'm goin hard\nAnd I ain't slowin up, 'til the Heliport's in my back yard\n'Til my whole team sign they name on that black card\n'Til I bring New York back, 'til I show you where I'm from\n'Til I show you how it's done, show you why I'm number one\n'Til my peeps is out the hood, 'til I buy my moms a jet\n'Til I own my first island and cash a trillion dollar check\n'Til I'm at the top of Forbes' richest lookin kosher\nWith my name and my picture, right next to Oprah\nIn negotiations with Bill Gates and his broker\n'Til I'm with Jehovah it ain't over 'til it's over\n\n\nBesides God, what the fuck should I fear?\nThe only one could stop me is that chick in the mirror\nI built my career on, blood sweat and tears\nAnd I'm still here, gettin stronger each year\nCause what don't kill me, could only help build me\nI guess all that dirt just made me more filthy\nIf being loyal's a crime, then I'm so guilty\nIf you was missin a spine you'd still have to feel me\nSome came and went but your girl is everlasting\n'Til the day I'm gasping (gasping)\nAnd niggas droppin tears on my Versace casket\nAnd I'm, reunited with Big, like nigga what happened?\nShit got drastic, I missed you with a passion\nBy now they should realize I'm not the average rap chick\nAin't nuttin they could do now to stop my shine\nThis is God's plan homey, it ain't mine\n\n\nUntil my heartbeat stops, my flesh goes numb\nAnd the last breath leaves my lung, I'll be\nThe big Q.B., the problem in Prada\nThe bitch that these rap hoes wanna become\nI been hated on many times, adored and idolized\nCheck your stats, I'm all that, bottom line\nIt's all there in black and white, read it and weep\nI'm the, perfect example of keepin it street\nCause when it's all said and done and at the end of the day\nMy actions spoke louder than whatever they say\nYeah I'll rep the hood, stood the test of time\nSo a cell'll hold my body and never my mind\nSo, never mind any of y'all petty tactics\nI'm gettin fetty, movin through them tax brackets\nBitch you gotta be kiddin me, Kim's the epitome\nI'm the ghost of Big so you could never get rid of me"}}, {"title":

get at you\nCome through shinin', they yap you\nIn broad daylight kidnap you\nFeds get clap too\nPolice stay on us like tattoos\nNiggas only grind 'cause we have to\nMoney is power\nSling crack, weed, and powder\nFiends come through every hour\nIt's all about that dollar\nAnd we no deal with cowards\nWeak lamb get devoured\nBy the lion in the concrete jungle\nThe strong stand and rumble\nThe weak fold and crumble\nIt's the land of trouble\nBrooklyn home of the greatest rappers\nBIG comes first then the queen comes after\n\nNow put your lighters up (Bed-Stuy)\nPut your lighters up (New York)\nPut your lighters up (D.C.)\nKeep putting your lighters up (Philadelphia)\nPut your lighters up (Detroit)\nPut your lighters up (Chi-Town)\nKeep putting them lighters up\nNo matter where you from, put your lighters up\n\nNow, let me give you a walk through\nShow you what to do and you don't do\nWhere it's not safe to go to\nThem boys approach you\nBetter say quick who you close to\nDon't come through if niggas don't know you\n'Cause people is talking\nThe streets is watching\nThe D's is lurking\nStash the nine in the garbage\nThe life of a hustler\nThe life of a gambler\nDice game, kill more niggas than cancer\nYou know who you fuck with\nBrooklyn don't run, we run shit\nRoll up and just bumrush shit\nWe don't play that\nOut in BK, not at all\nGor a pound leave your face on the wall\nR.I.P. in memory of\nNever show thy enemies love\nWe get it on where we live\nYou better have a pass when you cross that bridge\nWelcome to Brooklyn\n\n\nDamn homie I'm so tore\nAnd I don't think I'm ever gone smoke no more\nAnd I don't think I'm ever gone drink no more\nBut fuck it, bartender you can give me one more\n(We in the club like)\nDamn homie I'm so tore\n(Lighting the dutch like)\nAnd I don't think I'm ever gone smoke no more\n(Passing the bub like)\nAnd I don't think I'm ever gone drink no more\n(Back at the bar like)\nFuck it, bartender you can give me one more\n\nSee, BIG done told you\nI'm the hottest bitch on the planet\nBiggest sex symbol, since Janet\nThe Zanotti bandit\nLaying in the cut like a bandage\nCome through Fulton St. in the vanquish\nDoing them damage\nAnd if you don't understand it\nThen let me give it to you in Spanish\nSoy la senorita mas Linda del barrios\nY lo es abo tu eres despacio\nStill over in Brazil sipping Moscato\nYou must of forgot though\nSo I'mma take you back to the block yo\nPut you on to how we rock yo\nSome are boosting\n12-year-olds prostituting\nHit-men hired for execution\nThere's no solution\nNiggas still piss in the hallways\nFiends get high on em' all day\nThe youth them bang at the cops off the roof\nIf you don't know my town is the truth\nWelcome to Brooklyn"}}, {"title": "Lights Camera Action",

residing\nYour honor, Lil' Kim is a threat to society\nShe has shown a blatant disregard for the law\nAnd has killed six fine law enforcement agents in the line of duty\nFor the vicious acts, she should be punished to the fullest extent of the law\n\nPardon me your honor, may I address the bench?\nThey tryna assassinate me like they did to Larry Flynt\nExcuse my persona\nI may be hardcore but I'm not Jeffrey Dahmer\nEver since I killed 'em, I ain't been in trouble since\nIt wasn't my fault, I acted out of self-defense\nHe killed my best friend (Who's him?) I mean them\nThey was all dressed in blue and they want me dead too\nThey had real grenade bombs inside of their palms\nAnd a whole bunch of guns wrapped tight in their arms\nSee them bastards woke me up when they broke my alarm\nI was getting my ass licked by this cat named Tom\n(Stop!) I heard three guns cocked, that's when Tom dropped\nThey sent the bow and arrow right through his tank top\n(Oh, she's lying!) Lying? Blood was gushing on the floor\nFingerprints all on the door, need I say more?\nPulled out the remote can and shot blows after blow, ploom!\nQueen off her toes, they fell down like dominoes\nI think it was the Matrix, I mean it was the Matrix\nWhat was I to do? Sit back and just take this?\nYo, I'm tellin' you now If I lose this debate\nLike in Dead Presidents I'm going out like Larenz Tate\nSee I ain't gon be stupid, I'ma take all y'all to the shift\nI should be able to say what I want, what the fuck I plead the fifth?\n(Now Kim, Kim) Fuck that Cee-Lo, I got to save the world\nThe first female king and they mad 'cause I'm a girl\n\nUh, with all due respect your honor\nExcuse my client's temperament\nWho has had social intelligence?\nWith so much innocence we have to implement\nShe was slightly out of place\nBut if you grant us a grain of your grace\nI'll assure you it's only stress due to the severity of the case\nImagine for a minute, yourself in the same shoes\nThe same sense of survival and the same nothing to lose\nYour children, your lovely wife, I mean look at her\nThe only thing she's guilty of is having no choice in the matter\n\nLord I cry (I cry) from the things I've seen (that I've seen)\nAnd Lord I cry (I cry) from the things I've seen (ooh)\nIf you only knew (only knew) the things that I've been through\n(Oh yeah) you'd know why (you'd know why-y-y)\nYou'd know why I cry, I cry, I cry\n(Order! Order! Order!\nOrder! Order! Order!)\n\nOrder in the courts, I'm examining her thoughts\nAnd the notes on why you started slaughtering the fort\nThe men dressed in blue, they were undercover cops\nHungry to see another black motherfucker shot\nThey ran up in your spot and no one gave the orders\nEven Tom was tapped with a mic and a tape recorder\n(He was in on it too!)\nYeah\n(I guess I should've known)\nYeah\n(Objection your honor)\nYo objection overruled\nI know the news they tried to pay the grand jury\nTo give you life sentence with parole up in thirty\nNow that's dirty, surveillance and you debate\nFuck Will! Now you're the new Enemy of the State\nAngela Bobbett's cake compared to you\nAnd Junior Mafia, that clique ain't scared to move\nSo they took precautions\nGrenades from all force and\nProfessional marksman with four fours of war hymn\nBut you stopped, dropped, rolled and duck\nShot back other bitches would've folded up\nNow that's my kind of bitch\nI know I'm the judge\nBut I love that bitch\nAnd I'm coming with her\nCreme of crop, and me, I'ma hold her down\nResign with A-K's so we blowing the trial\nLook it's a setup\nYo, Kim come on\n(I'm right behind you, baby)\nYo, Kim, come on\n(I'm right here with you man)\n\nLord I cry, I cry\nFrom the things that I've seen\nThat I've seen...", "image": "https://images.genius.com/f86af706653439f87277522f8443e101.1000x1000x1.jpg",

"lyrics": "Will the court please rise?\nJudge Funk Doctor Spock residing\nYour honor, Lil' Kim is a threat to society\nShe has shown a blatant disregard for the law\nAnd has killed six fine law enforcement agents in the line of duty\nFor the vicious acts, she should be punished to the fullest extent of the law\n\nPardon me your honor, may I address the bench?\nThey tryna assassinate me like they did to Larry Flynt\nExcuse my persona\nI may be hardcore but I'm not Jeffrey Dahmer\nEver since I killed 'em, I ain't been in trouble since\nIt wasn't my fault, I acted out of self-defense\nHe killed my best friend (Who's him?) I mean them\nThey was all dressed in blue and they want me dead too\nThey had real grenade bombs inside of their palms\nAnd a whole bunch of guns wrapped tight in their arms\nSee them bastards woke me up when they broke my alarm\nI was getting my ass licked by this cat named Tom\n(Stop!) I heard three guns cocked, that's when Tom dropped\nThey sent the bow and arrow right through his tank top\n(Oh, she's lying!) Lying? Blood was gushing on the floor\nFingerprints all on the door, need I say more?\nPulled out the remote can and shot blows after blow, ploom!\nQueen off her toes, they fell down like dominoes\nI think it was the Matrix, I mean it was the Matrix\nWhat was I to do? Sit back and just take this?\nYo, I'm tellin' you now If I lose this debate\nLike in Dead Presidents I'm going out like Larenz Tate\nSee I ain't gon be stupid, I'ma take all y'all to the shift\nI should be able to say what I want, what the fuck I plead the fifth?\n(Now Kim, Kim) Fuck that Cee-Lo, I got to save the world\nThe first female king and they mad 'cause I'm a girl\n\nUh, with all due respect your honor\nExcuse my client's temperament\nWho has had social intelligence?\nWith so much innocence we have to implement\nShe was slightly out of place\nBut if you grant us a grain of your grace\nI'll assure you it's only stress due to the severity of the case\nImagine for a minute, yourself in the same shoes\nThe same sense of survival and the same nothing to lose\nYour children, your lovely wife, I mean look at her\nThe only thing she's guilty of is having no choice in the matter\n\nLord I cry (I cry) from the things I've seen (that I've seen)\nAnd Lord I cry (I cry) from the things I've seen (ooh)\nIf you only knew (only knew) the things that I've been through\n(Oh yeah) you'd know why (you'd know why-y-y)\nYou'd know why I cry, I cry, I cry\n(Order! Order! Order!\nOrder! Order! Order!)\n\nOrder in the courts, I'm examining her thoughts\nAnd the notes on why you started slaughtering the fort\nThe men dressed in blue, they were undercover cops\nHungry to see another black motherfucker shot\nThey ran up in your spot and no one gave the orders\nEven Tom was tapped with a mic and a tape recorder\n(He was in on it too!)\nYeah\n(I guess I should've known)\nYeah\n(Objection your honor)\nYo objection overruled\nI know the news they tried to pay the grand jury\nTo give you life sentence with parole up in thirty\nNow that's dirty, surveillance and you debate\nFuck Will! Now you're the new Enemy of the State\nAngela Bobbett's cake compared to you\nAnd Junior Mafia, that clique ain't scared to move\nSo they took precautions\nGrenades from all force and\nProfessional marksman with four fours of war hymn\nBut you stopped, dropped, rolled and duck\nShot back other bitches would've folded up\nNow that's my kind of bitch\nI know I'm the judge\nBut I love that bitch\nAnd I'm coming with her\nCreme of crop, and me, I'ma hold her down\nResign with A-K's so we blowing the trial\nLook it's a setup\nYo, Kim come on\n(I'm right behind you, baby)\nYo, Kim, come on\n(I'm right here with you man)\n\nLord I cry, I cry\nFrom the things that I've seen\nThat I've seen..."}}, {"title": "Lil' Kim Free (Hood Newz)", "album": "Ms. G.O.A.T.", "year": "2008-06-03",

and one clan\nYes mans, they surround us like steaks in pans\nAll 'em wanna be the man, right hands wash the left hands\nLoyalty's priority in this fam\nWhere life's initiated, ain't no givin' it back\nOnce you in it, like Bennett, you'll soon be lieutenant\nLike me, the Don Juan, that's Yvonne\nThe sweat-a the money getter\nCoppin' mad cheddar\nStevie was Wondering how I got in this position\nOne day Frank was fishin' for competition, expedition\nNumber one, his name is Barry Madanno\nPush the phat Milano, '96 stick-shift 'cross the Verrazano\nI lay gently in the Bentley, through binoculars he seemed popular\nGivenchy socks, Cartier coolats\nH-class rocks and charms like Bohemians\nSick like leukemians, receding hairlines\nWatch how genuine this gold mine recline\nWhen Frank pops the wine, I cocks the nine\nNiggas peeped it from behind and slipped they clips in quick\nOne chick named Nick thought she was the shit\nTried to play Big Poppa, don't worry\nMinutes before I drop her, the *blow! blow! blow!*\nLike a parolee, the bitch violated\nSo how you like it: coffins or cremated?\n\nIt ain't a day of my life that rolls by\nThat I don't get high, sit back, and wan' cry\nI used to roll hard with tons of bitches\nNow, it's just me and my niggas\nIt ain't a day of my life that rolls by\nThat I don't get high, sit back, and wan' cry\nI used to roll hard with tons of bitches\nNow, it's just me and my niggas\n\nStreet murderers, thug parasites\nWe official, no fake gators\nCoppin' firearms with dud missles\nWe leavin' scar tissues\nThat nigga Barry still aggy about that slut\nMob nigga, what! threw the gang sign up\nThe nigga chuckles, just slip the loot\nOn my belt buckles and cracked his middle knuckles\nDamn! How could a deal for a couple mill\nResult to such violence\nAnd throw our whole shit off balance?\nBut still, they pat me down from all angles\nTrapped inside the Devil's triangle\nLike Bo I had the Jangles\nAnd movin' slow to slide up on these Mexicans\nOne cross-eyed and hunchbacked\nThe other must be mixed with Black\nThe third nigga had missin' teeth and tattoo teardrops\nLong hair, chest felt like a bag of rocks\nBefore this chops\nI grabbed the keys to locks, the jewels and the rocks\nThe cream in the box, et cetera, et cetera, and it don't stop\nI got away with everything, the cash and the stash\n\nIt ain't a day of my life that rolls by\nThat I don't get high, sit back, and wan' cry\nI used to roll hard with tons of bitches\nNow, it's just me and my niggas\nIt ain't a day of my life that rolls by\nThat I don't get high, sit back, and wan' cry\nI used to roll hard with tons of bitches\nNow, it's just me and my niggas\n\nSo now I'm titled, mission accomplished\nMy man was astonished\nHe looked as if there was a foul aroma in the air\nStinkin! I know this nigga's thinkin'\n\"Damn! She too little, too pretty, too quiet\nThe bitch is hired,\" mob's wife for life\nDiamond heist with Trife, contracts on your life\nWe increase the price, uhh\nSo guess who the bitch is?\nBut for now I be the mistress\n\nIt ain't a day of my life that rolls by\nThat I don't get high, sit back, and wan' cry\nI used to roll hard with tons of bitches\nNow, it's just me and my niggas\nIt ain't a day of my life that rolls by\nThat I don't get high, sit back, and wan' cry\nI used to roll hard with tons of bitches\nNow, it's just me and my niggas"}}, {"title": "Magic Stick", "album": "La Bella Mafia", "year": "2003-03-04", "lyrics": "I got the magic stick\nI know if I can hit once, I can hit twice\nI hit the baddest chicks\nShorty don't believe me, then come with me tonight\nAnd I'll show you maaagic\n(What?

the pink panther\nAsk Leon Ganther, (haha bout)\nHaha, he know\nThe rap Josephine Baker\nKeep her wrist looking like strobe lights\nWhen I bust my gun, niggas think I'm babylon (fer real)\nCause my rocks shine on jus' like dey sygon (boc boc boc boc..dun kno)\nDeceptive cons\nDeceptive nets\nFuck it\nWho you with\nBetta claim your sect\nCaution walkin' on me might break your neck\nI'm like water

may sound rude\nBut I don't love you dudes\nTape you eatin' my pussy and throw you on the interlude (scene)\nYou think I give a fuck cause you paid for my food?\nPut you out on the highway and make you strip nude, (hehe)\nThen drive away in your car with your wallet\nThought I was sweet meat\nLook what you done started \nYou ain't know about the,\"set it off queen bitch\"\nIn the Porsche, license plate read,\"filthy rich\"\nI spend money\nLend money\nI play niggas with money\nMatter fact I love money\nAnd I never borrow\nEven if the ones low\nCause if it cost ten, I give 'em 20 so I never owe (scene)\nAnd other women can't stand the way I'm livin'\nThey not my problem\nMy main concern is Kim (is all about)\n\nLast night i heard the screamin'\nBut it dont make no sense, fi call

club\nDJ rock rub-a-dub jams by Beenie Man (scene)\nMe sees P.Diddy and the fam\nIn the back by the rest rooms, shaking hands with the fans\nFunny style cats bump us while we dance\nYou know a broke nigga always fucks up the plans\nDJ switch the music to the Wu-tang clan\nD-Rock hit himm in the face with the Saint Ives can\nSecurity came through, broke it up, then he ran\nBe back at the bar again\nLaughin' and partyin'\nJerks showin off pullin 50s out they clothes (for real)\nPlease babe, bro we blow our nose with those ((you kno) dun kno)\nLinen crushed out\nEgyptian mushed out\nSome boy lookin' shot in the party rushed out\nMy niggas, they surround me like the pope\nYou should've seen the shit, one big joke\nAnd as usual, this cat with an afro\nSnitchin' for no dough\nInfo to popo\nFuckin' dodo\nSilly like the time I got you watched\nI hate cowards\nYa'll suckas needa blow cock (for real {scene})\n\nLast night i heard the screamin'\nBut it dont make no sense, fi call the

roll around in the streets\nWhen I get home it's going down in the sheets\nDon't mind you looking cause she's mine girl, she a big fine girl\nEverytime she whine, she move her body like a spider\nAnd everybody watching all that ass she got behind her\nMoney maker shine but I don't mind cause I'mma grinder\n\nYou know how we be moving\nMe and Kevin Gates\nI'm a star and I'mma keep shining\nLike the roof on the Wraith\nEat my pussy with his breakfast\nCause he love the way it tastes\nHe said that I stay on his mind\nHow I be sitting on his face\nI don't need nothing but bread\nI don't need niggas for nothing but head\nThey all fantasize being with Kim\nEvery night, I'm laying right next to him\nFuck my ex, you make me wetter\nFabulous, you make me better\nChanel sneakers, Chanel leather\nChanel bag in Chanel weather\nHundred grand on that PRG\nI don't hear what no peon say\nSee me with him, just know that's me\nTen carats scream fiance\nSee my pussy print all through my jeans\nI know you watch all this ass behind me\nShould be watchin' this nigga that's right beside me\n\nDon't mind you looking cause she mine girl, she for me\nFall off, she gon' hold it down, please

us take over, I'm a shooter with a shooter\nSays she down here from up north, college, she commuting\nShe my new professor, I'm learning, I'm a student\nHer momma hate me, say I'm too advanced, ask her how she's doing\nShe never say it to my face, I'm turnt up I'm a movie, yeah\nAt night she hear her daughter scream, Cassius Clay, I boom bye yae\nMy hand around her throat she naked, I bent her over on the dresser\nIt's too gangsta how I'm dressin', beat the pussy up, no question\nPull her hair ho, you for Kevin, hair red or blonde, or whatever\nI-I'm caressin' on her breastes, kissing on her, you a blessin'\nKnew I loved her when I met her, she love me, you looking for her\n\nDon't mind you looking cause she mine girl, she for me\nFall off, she gon' hold it down, please

body like a spider\nAnd everybody watching all that ass she got behind her\nMoney maker shine but I don't mind cause I'mma grind her\n\nYou pulled it out and now he's shookin' on it\nGrabbed my neck and now I'm choking on it\nHold it down if you go to prison\nConversate, conjugal visits\nKeep our love, I got the COD\nI'mma hold it down like P.O.P\nThat dope pussy that chronic\nThat DRE, so don't OD\nHold up baby, come here, give it to me\nI'm about to uh huh, lick the pussy\nIn the car, don't give a fuck who lookin'\nAnd stroking on it, hustle through this for you\nDick her full, don't know if you notice\nSay it ain't come here on a muscle\nLot of spit when you humming on it\nLegs shaking now you cumming on it\nQuiet babe, power coming on it\nUber coming, now you going home\nI know it's difficult dealing\nWith a nigga that's in my profession\nHold up babe, why you in your feelings?\nBreak it for me, gotta tell your nigga\n\"Fly a kite\" Michael Jackson, thriller\nYou say, \"don't nobody keep it realer\"\nReal one, I homicide the vision\nSay her name, they gon' get the business\nChris Brown, playing when I killed her\nHe could fuck you too cause that's my nigga\nHand cuffin' pussy, I ain't with it\nShe could be for you and treat her special\nYeah, she say she love me, you looking for her\n\nDon't mind you looking cause she mine girl, she for me\nFall off, she gon' hold it down, please believe\nFirearm, we roll around in the streets\nWhen I get home it's going down in the sheets\nDon't mind you looking cause she's mine girl, she a big fine girl\nEverytime she whine, she

Lil' Kim (na na nahh-nah)\nIt's Tim-baland, and Lil' Kim (uh, uh-huh, what)\nYo, yo yo yo, this joint is strictly for heavyweighters\nNot them playa haters, knahmsayin?\nCause in the Commission, you ask for permission to hit em, uhh\nVerse One: Lil' Kim\nMy man Blake flew me to the Erie Lake\nIntroduced me to this heavyweighter, called hisself Drake\nFirst mistake, Jesus piece was fake\nBut wait, he got singles in his cake, I ain't fuckin with him\nNumber one rule, always keep your cool, even though\nYou ain't a fool, and you see right through the nigga, how he figure?\nIf he holdin less than six\nHe gonna get the seven digits or visit, numbers in my Wizard?\nDuke ain't even worth the space\nGlass shoes and igloos put him dead in his place\nDamn Blake, can't tell this cat is a snake?\nI got 20/20 vision (uhh) funny money vision (uh-huh)\nNo dough, no show, dodo, that's a no-no\nJust some famous words from the late Frank White\nI blink right, if your bank tight\nDuke wanted me to work for him, even flirt for him\nWear a short skirt for him, he don't know\nI'mma end up hurtin him at the end of the day\nShit, I got bills to pay, and it ain't my fault\nIf money talk and bullshit walk, round one\nChorus: Andrea Martin\nI'm in love wit ta mon, nearly twice my age\nI want to give it up anyway, because it more pay\nMore time, more money, have it your way\n(repeat 2X)\nKnow de money and the lovin is my style\nMe a forget it tonight\nVerse Two: Lil' Kim\nMmm... uhh, UHH, uhh, uhh\nThe play starts at 8:00, let's hit the venue\nInvited his man, and some bitch named Kendall\nTried to style on em, shoes with the crocadile on em\nBut the nigga still was corny, he bore me\nHis preference was more sorta like soccer\nMe, I do operas with the Mali and the vodka\nOut in Cali gettin proper, and I, betcha fifty\nMy whole commitee stay shitty ask Smitty with the Desert E's\nOne glance at the Benz-y make ya freeze\nPlease, I got a mil on these, whatchu talkin? I...\nHate this nigga in the worst way\nAnd I didn't wanna be here in the first place\nBut uhh, It's just vendetta for my man\nDo anything for the fam, I'mma go along with the plan\nTryin hard not to throw him off\nAnd I know he soft, when I cough, it's to cover up a lie\nAnd the lie keep me full of empathy\nSo when I shit on this nigga, he gon' still pamper me\nI see, this nigga ain't about nuttin, cause he keep frontin\nHe must be up to somethin, round em up, here I come\nUhhh\nChorus\nVerse Three: Lil' Kim, Trife, Lil' Cease\nAs the evening winds down, I'm making sure\nThat my milli got rounds, plane ticket back to town, now\nI picked the place, Umberto's of course it's\nItalian where they confiscate, burners in they office\nMetamorphis anywhere, any year, who dare\nThey the mob and they don't care, and I swear, while I'm\nContemplatin thinkin about later\nHere come the waiter with the phone in the tray, anyways\n\"Is there a Queen in the house?\" How could he say this out his mouth?\nI'm the only black chick with diamonds this thick, hopin\nIt's my nigga Blake C\nCause sometimes these cat's like to fool you\nCheck it, let me school you\nRemember when I said those niggas robbed Leo\nRolled on him, stuck him up in the black Geo\nThey was creole, used to be a tight trio\nTil one fled with the dough, what's his name? (Rio!)\nI was a girlie lover, smooth undercover\nPlayed they hoes in tight clothes like they was no other\nDumbin like the Jungle Brothers, til they caught me for my gems\nAll I'm sayin is what he did to me, do it to him, is you straight?\n\nYou late, duct tape and cable rope\nOnce I wrap it round his throat it's all she wrote, uhhhwha (oh oh)\nNah nah nah nah (oh oh)\nWhookie whookie whooooo!

uh-huh, what)\nIt's Tim-baland, and Lil' Kim (na na nahh-nah)\nIt's Tim-baland, and Lil' Kim (uh, uh-huh, what)\nYo, yo yo yo, this joint is strictly for heavyweighters\nNot them playa haters, knahmsayin?\nCause in the Commission, you ask for permission to hit em, uhh\nVerse One: Lil' Kim\nMy man Blake flew me to the Erie Lake\nIntroduced me to this heavyweighter, called hisself Drake\nFirst mistake, Jesus piece was fake\nBut wait, he got singles in his cake, I ain't fuckin with him\nNumber one rule, always keep your cool, even though\nYou ain't a fool, and you see right through the nigga, how he figure?\nIf he holdin less than six\nHe gonna get the seven digits or visit, numbers in my Wizard?\nDuke ain't even worth the space\nGlass shoes and igloos put him dead in his place\nDamn Blake, can't tell this cat is a snake?\nI got 20/20 vision (uhh) funny money vision (uh-huh)\nNo dough, no show, dodo, that's a no-no\nJust some famous words from the late Frank White\nI blink right, if your bank tight\nDuke wanted me to work for him, even flirt for him\nWear a short skirt for him, he don't know\nI'mma end up hurtin him at the end of the day\nShit, I got bills to pay, and it ain't my fault\nIf money talk and bullshit walk, round one\nChorus: Andrea Martin\nI'm in love wit ta mon, nearly twice my age\nI want to give it up anyway, because it more pay\nMore time, more money, have it your way\n(repeat 2X)\nKnow de money and the lovin is my style\nMe a forget it tonight\nVerse Two: Lil' Kim\nMmm... uhh, UHH, uhh, uhh\nThe play starts at 8:00, let's hit the venue\nInvited his man, and some bitch named Kendall\nTried to style on em, shoes with the crocadile on em\nBut the nigga still was corny, he bore me\nHis preference was more sorta like soccer\nMe, I do operas with the Mali and the vodka\nOut in Cali gettin proper, and I, betcha fifty\nMy whole commitee stay shitty ask Smitty with the Desert E's\nOne glance at the Benz-y make ya freeze\nPlease, I got a mil on these, whatchu talkin? I...\nHate this nigga in the worst way\nAnd I didn't wanna be here in the first place\nBut uhh, It's just vendetta for my man\nDo anything for the fam, I'mma go along with the plan\nTryin hard not to throw him off\nAnd I know he soft, when I cough, it's to cover up a lie\nAnd the lie keep me full of empathy\nSo when I shit on this nigga, he gon' still pamper me\nI see, this nigga ain't about nuttin, cause he keep frontin\nHe must be up to somethin, round em up, here I come\nUhhh\nChorus\nVerse Three: Lil' Kim, Trife, Lil' Cease\nAs the evening winds down, I'm making sure\nThat my milli got rounds, plane ticket back to town, now\nI picked the place, Umberto's of course it's\nItalian where they confiscate, burners in they office\nMetamorphis anywhere, any year, who dare\nThey the mob and they don't care, and I swear, while I'm\nContemplatin thinkin about later\nHere come the waiter with the phone in the tray, anyways\n\"Is there a Queen in the house?\" How could he say this out his mouth?\nI'm the only black chick with diamonds this thick, hopin\nIt's my nigga Blake C\nCause sometimes these cat's like to fool you\nCheck it, let me school you\nRemember when I said those niggas robbed Leo\nRolled on him, stuck him up in the black Geo\nThey was creole, used to be a tight trio\nTil one fled with the dough, what's his name? (Rio!)\nI was a girlie lover, smooth undercover\nPlayed they hoes in tight clothes like they was no other\nDumbin like the Jungle Brothers, til they caught me for my gems\nAll I'm sayin is what he did to me, do it to him, is you straight?\n\nYou late, duct tape and cable rope\nOnce I wrap it round his throat it's all she wrote, uhhhwha (oh oh)\nNah nah nah nah (oh oh)\nWhookie whookie whooooo! (oh oh)\n(oh oh oh) nah nah nah nah\n(oh oh) wha!\n(oh oh oh) nah nah nah nah (oh oh)\n(oh oh oh) nah nah nah nah wha\n(oh oh oh) nah nah nah nah wha\n(oh oh oh) wha uh nah nah nah nah\n(oh oh oh) nah

Notorious K-I-M\nYour flow's got flaws like a chipped diamond\nOh yes, I've been watchin you, copy me\nMy spot's safe, got it on lock and key\nI'm who you wanna be, but you can't be who you're

mouth and not in your hands\nJust a bad girl always rockin' dimes\nWith the see-who's-stockin' skaters with the Lizzy's\nPurpose with the deadbeats\nUsually spited by my Goldilocks\nWhile first movin' flocks I'm movin' drops\nCop the Ferrari when I'm roomin' the range\nTwo of the same it ain't a thang pocket the change\nNow I'm just doin' my thing enjoyin' the fame\nWhy not ain't no other bitches

do that, baby)\nNo matter what people say\nWe got it going on\nWho cares about what they think\n(Shake your body to the rhythm)\nWe are the number one\n(If it drives you crazy)\n\nEverywhere I go red carpet\nGave the keys to valet tell 'em to park it\nThen I jumps out the Azure, a Lil' Kim aura\nGirls making faces like Ace Ventura\nAnd my B-A-D G-I-R-L-S is in the stretch LX\nAin't shit you can tell us\nEven got some of these niggas jealous\nBut tonight ain't about the fellas\nBvlgari perfume from a mile ya smell us\nModel agencies say it's easy to sell us\nWe got sex appeal, I'ma keep it real\nIf I didn't have a deal I'd still be worth a mill', uh\nDepending on how I feel I might go on a heist\nSo at my wedding I can throw ice instead of throwing rice\nWe fly like kites never gettin' into fights\nI got a whole bunch of dykes on ninja bikes\n\nNo matter what people say\nWe got it going on\nWho cares about what they think\n(Won't you come and)\nWe are the number one\n(Come and show me how you do that, baby)\nNo matter what people say\nWe got it going on\nWho cares about what they think\n(Shake your body to the rhythm)\nWe are the number one\n(If it drives you crazy)\n\nI'm just trying to be me, doing what I got to do\nSo why y'all keep hating on me and my crew?\nYo, I'm saying Q.B, look at them and look at you\nTrue, if I was you I'd hate me too\nLouis Vuitton shoes and a whole lot of booze\nEvery other week a different dude and other crews\nI make offers nobody can refuse\nYou might even see me on the channel nine news\nI get paid just for laying in the shade\nTo take pictures with a glass of lemonade\nMy rocks shine like it was dipped in Cascade\n(Uh-uh, Kim been fly since she was in the fifth grade)\nWake up in the morning to breakfast from a maid\nWanted me so bad you ain't copped or bootleg\nY'all niggas played like a high top fade\nSome of the shit I hear I don't know how it got played\nY'all rock Versace and y'all went out and bought it\nI rock Versace and y'all know I ain't paid for it\nMy fam deep with security in the jeep\nWhen the Queen come in town everything shut down\n\nNo matter what people say\nWe got it going on\nWho cares about what they think\n(Won't you come and)\nWe are the number one\n(Come and show me how you do that, baby)\nNo matter what people say\nWe got it going on\nWho cares about what they think\n(Shake your body to the rhythm)\nWe are the number one\n(If it drives you crazy)\n\nBreakdown, uh\nLet's dance come on\nLet's dance come on\nI see you, let's go\nYeah, Queen Bee, do it like this\n\nI'm the highest, your highest title, numero uno\nI'm not a Puerto Rican but I'm speakin' so that 'ju know\n*Rakim* \"This is how it should be done..\n'Cause this style, is identical to none\"\nThe hip, hop, the hippie, the hippie\nTo the hip hip-hop a ya don't stop\nTo rock it to the bang-bang boogie\nTo up jump the boogie\nTo the boogie to the boogedy beat\nNow what you hear is not a fake\nIt's the real Lil' Kim, Queen Bee (That's right)\nNow I know y'all heard other females rap\nBut they ain't got nothin' on me\n'Cause, y'all take to my rap cause my rap's the best\nA hundred and fifty thou, sixteen bars nothin less (Nothin less)\nSo to y'all haters, I paid y'all no mind\nIn fact I'ma give it to y'all one more time like..\n\nUh yeah, what?\nCome on, bounce, what?\n\nNo matter what people say\nWe got it going on\nWho cares about what they think\n(Won't you come and)\nWe are the number one\n(Come and show me how you do that, baby)\nNo matter what people say\nWe got it going on\nWho cares about what they

off the Henny and R\u00e9my\nI didn't mind it, when he fucked me from behind it\nFelt fine, 'specially when he used to grind it\nHe was a trick when I sucked his dick\nHe used to, pass me bricks, credit cards and shit\nSuck him to sleep, I took the keys to the Jeep\nTell him, \"I'll be back,\" go fuck with some other cats\nFlirtin', gettin' numbers, in the summer, ho hop\nRaw top in my man's drop\nThen this homie Jimmy, he's screamin', \"Gimme\"\nLay me on my back, bustin' nuts all in me\nAfter ten times we fucked, I think I bust twice\nHe was nice, kept my neck filled with ice\nPut me in Chanels, kept me out nice\nCalled suckin' his dick, \"rockin' the mic\"\nIt was somethin' about this dude I couldn't stand\nSomethin' that coulda made his ass a real man\nSomethin' I wanted, but I never was pushy\nThe motherfucker never ate my pussy\n\nI don't want dick tonight\nEat my pussy right\nUh, uh, uh, uh Lil' Kim, Lil' Kim, bring it to me now\n\nI know a dude named Ron Doo push a Q\nHad a wild crew on Flatbush & Avenue U\nHad a weed spot, used to pump African black\nHe used to, seal his bag so his workers wouldn't tap\nI used to see him, in The Tunnel, with fuckers at dawn\nWhisper in my ear he wanna get his fuck on\nI dug him, so I fucked him, it wasn't nuttin'\nHe wanted me to suck him, but I didn't, I ain't frontin'\nThe sex was wack, a four-stroke creep\nI jumped on the dick, rode his ass to sleep\nHe called next week, askin' why I ain't beep him\n\"I thought your ass was still sleepin'\"\nHe laughed, told me he bought a new Path\nCould he come over right fast and fuck my pretty ass?\n\"I'll pass, nigga, the dick was trash\nIf sex was record sales you would be double glass\nThe only way you seein' me is if you eatin' me\nDowntown, taste my love like Horace Brown\nTryin' to impress me with your 5 G stones\nI give you 10 G's, nigga, if ya leave me alone,\" screamin'\n\nI don't want dick tonight\nEat my pussy right\nI don't want dick tonight\nEat my pussy right\n\nThe moral of the story is this:\nYou ain't lickin' this, you ain't stickin' this\nAnd I got witnesses, ask any nigga I been with\nThey ain't hit shit till they stuck they tongue in this\nI ain't with that frontin' shit\nI got my own Benz, I got my own ends, immediate friends\nMe and my girls rock worlds, some big niggas\nFuck for car keys, and double-digit figures\nGood dick I cherish, I could be blunt\nI treat it like it's precious, I ain't gonna front\nFor limp-dick niggas, that's frontin' like they willy\nSuck my pussy till they kill me, you feel me?\n\nI don't want dick tonight\nEat my pussy right\nI don't want dick tonight\nEat my pussy right\nI don't want dick tonight"}}, {"title": "Not Tonight (Ladies Night Remix)", "album": "Hard Core",

got white, Hannah\nI feel like Tony Montana\nWhite diamonds, panda\n\nI got broads in Atlanta\nCouple broads that are scammers\nThey work hard to Atlanta\nTo hit the malls in Atlanta\nYSL, fly as hell\nParty like we just got out of jail\nCouple my shooters fresh out on bail\nI keep them bitches that's bad as hell\nI blew my money in aces\nI\u2019ve seen your woman crush naked\nFuck and forgot what her name is\nShe didn\u2019t even know what a wraith is\nHop out the rolly royce\nDiamonds all over my rolly boy\nYou fell in love with the bitch\nDid you think you was her only boy?\nI am the king of the streets\nNiggas you look up to cater to me\nAlways been full, with the k in the street\nI told \u2018em that I would be back with the queen\nYa done messed up, feel the pressure\nChain too big, can\u2019t lift my neck up\nJust one hand, I lift the tech up\nAt his head, case he vest up!

your Moms for her stocks and bonds\nI got that bomb ass cock, a good-ass shot\nWith hardcore flows to keep a nigga dick rock\nSipping Zinfandel, up in Chippendales\nShopping Bloomingdale's for Prada bags\nFemale Don Dada has\nNo problems splitting cream with my team\nShit's straight like nine fifteen, y'nahmean\nCruise the diamond district with my biscuit\nFlossing my Rolex wrist shit\nI'm rich,

pissin on cotton)\n\nDo you see what I see, can you hear what I hear\nAll these stu-di-o gangsters, year after year\nWith these gimicks I can't take it they ain't real so they fakin it\nHow did they make it in this game for so long\nI know what's right from what's wrong, I know what's soft from what's hard\nI know a federal case, from a publicity charge\nMan I fought tooth and nail to keep them punks out of jail\nBut hoes wanna go to court 'til I pay them for they nails\nWho you tryin to be? Man it couldn't be me\nMy man spent guap and bought me my Continental T\nYou spent your advance on your Continental T\nI know you sick when you clean your rims you still see a Bee\nAnd we see you a liar, tryin to deny her\nJackie O. proved you far from a fighter\nComin at me bitch you playin with fire\nI ain't gon' come back at you, I'm comin at your ghostwriters\n\n\nI hear 'em talkin like they gangster material\nBut I don't see it man their gangster's invisible\nThe hot iron's what them gangsters put into you\n'Til you laid up and your gangster's on critical\nShots get into you bleedin like my men-e-straul\nAnd if I don't like you then I will pretend to\nIt's the ones that befriend you that turn up against you\nIn the court of law and drop a dime like Sprint do\nSupposed to be tough huh? 'Til them boys touch ya\nChump muh'fuckers start confessin like Usher\nI cut you off cause I knew I couldn't trust ya\nLame ass bustas, backwards-ass hustlers\nYou fake phony, you always was lil' homey\nBig lil' son baby' boy like Jody\nI put you under my wing, bought you your first Roley\nNigga I helped raised you, why would I play you?\n\n\nYou see it always be them ones talkin this and that\nHow they knife game ill and they gun go clap\nThem niggas rats, they run and they trap\n'Til they run in a trap, and there's no comin back\nIt be the same ones talkin 'bout the guns they sparkin\nThe dogs never bite but do a whole lotta barkin\nA whole lotta growlin 'til the wolves start howlin\nThey pitbull shit, man them niggas straight cowards\nGot 'em scared to death, pissin in they trousers\nAlways was a bitch that's why I sent his ass flowers\nThanks to the queen he can share 'em with his team\nYou can run top speed but you can't dodge the\nGot a clean 16 and my spit game mean\nDon't be fooled and deceived, everything ain't what it seems\nYou act like you don't know what side of town this realer\nNiggas softer than chinchillas but on wax they killers\n - 1/2"}},

murderer, I'm servin' these haters like a waitress\nBack to the basics\nI got the game in a chokehold, better take a No-Doze\nSleepin' on Kim is a no-no (UGH)\nThe capital Q-B, now take it to the E-E\nI'm bringin' things to light but you still can't see me\nI flows like the monthly you can't cramp my style\nCan't take the pain here's a Motrin child\nYou already know it's Ms. G.O.A.T\nNumero U-N-O, now here we go\n(Chorus)\nI rock ruff n stuff though they put me in cuffs\nBut still I\n(Rock on with ya bad self)\nI rock ruff though these punk niggas talk too much\nBut still I\n(Rock on

YALL STUPID\nAin't no doubt about it I'm the UNDISPUTED\nLyrical champion, dough I stack it\nMy verse crazy I write with stray jackets\nYou can't hack it, some try to backstab\nI drive by them haters while they try to flag cabs\nHate to brag but fuck it why shouldn't I\n'Gini with the top off, why wouldn't I\nI was tought by the streets so how couldn't I\nSee right pass niggas like BIG's crooked eye\nBOOM! BAM! GOT DAYYMMM!\nI'm hittin' so hard I be shakin' the land\nKIM GET IT CRUNK\nLike the speakers in ya trunk, got you feelin' drunk\nOff the rhythm that I give 'em\nSpit that venom, in 'em, honey girl be killin 'em\nYea, I put that on my unborn kids\nKim run this shit, man you know what it is\n(Chorus)\nI rock ruff n stuff though they put me in cuffs\nBut still I\n(Rock on with ya bad self)\nI rock ruff though these punk niggas talk too much\nBut still I\n(Rock on with ya bad self)"}}, {"title": "Scheamin'", "album": "Hard Core", "year": "1996-11-12", "lyrics": "Damn, boo, you see honey right there?

chicky bum\n\nWe 'bout to crush all competition\nAin't no chance for ya'll\nLil' Kim and Shanice, we 'bout to dance on ya'll\nLike a flow in the club, it don't matter where you come from\nUSA to UK, shake ya bum bum\nSean Paul dime, keep my hair done all the time\nEven got a manicurist in the booth while I rhyme\nInitials on our jackets like Laverne and Sheryl\nKids rock my Queen Bee logo like a PowerPuff Girl\nWe stay on tour from summer to winter\nAnd we rockin' public schools and daycare centers\nUh, united we stand, divided you fall\nD flawless necklace look like a disco ball\nWhoa, ya'll don't really want it with the whole Beehive\nWe goin' down in history, the illest gangstas alive\nPut ya hands on your shoulders, push 'em up, push 'em up\nIf you feel it in your bones, shake it up, shake it up\n\n\nNow I know I ain't grown, but that don't stop me\nFrom shakin' my anus\nSee I'm 'bout to blow, I'm soon to be famous\nNow me and Lil' Kim on the same track is crazy\nMatter fact you can call that amazing\nBack to back, shakin' our bum bums\nPicture us in the war, back to back shakin' off dum-dums\nIn YO, that's where I come from\nMy talents official, act up, the hounds'll come get you\nYou can catch me on my toes in them D&G flip-flops\nHopin' outta mommy's new burgundy six drop\nWhat, I can't stop what I do for real\nIt's like for ya'll I just got to prove my skills\nOh, I got a ring filled with all baguettes\nNails done, fresh do, be no regrets\nAll I ask is that ya'll show respect\nWhile I do my thing\nAnd shake it up with the coolest Queen, uh\n(Uh)\n\n + (Lil' Shanice) or *BOTH*\nJack Be Nimble (Jack better be quick)\nIt's the Queen and the Princess (Jack ain't spit)\nLike that news van *There they go again*\n(On NBC to) *Nickelodeon*\nSophisticated bad girls (Ya'll them mad girls)\nYa'll them birds everybody done had girls\nWhile dudes sendin' me diamonds and pearl sweaters\n(They little brothers send me sneakers and love letters)\nNext to Bill Gates, I'm tryna be runner up\nLike the elevater shaft, baby girl is comin' up\n(It's the ill collaboration from the Brook to the Yonks)\nNo more franks for this ma, now it's lobster and conch\nTo my kids in the hood, this one's for you\n(Grown folks and grandmas can shake they bum bum too)\nSo come on (Come on) Come on\n*Come on with it now, get up, get up\nGet up and get down with the get

fuck you\nAnd I bet you she will never do, oh\nAll the things I'll do for you\n\nAnd I bet ya, and I bet ya, baby\nAnd I bet ya she don't fuck you\nAnd I bet ya, bet ya, bet ya, baby\nAnd I bet ya she don't fuck you, no, baby\n\nBet you she don't fuck you\nLike you know I fuck you\nAnd I bet you she will never do, oh\nAll the things I'll do for you"}}, {"title": "Shut Up Bitch", "album": "The Naked

Kim tracks\nYour career is on the rocks again\nYeah, I'm back on top, what?\nYou forgot Queen Bitch, W-W-W-dot-com\nRead the 27th Psalm, sing along\nThe Lord is the light of my salvation\nThou shall fear when He calls\nSo when you MC's come to eat up my flesh and blood\nYa'll all will stumble and fall (ha ha!)\nStill that's not all, bitches have the gaul\nTo be writin' my rhymes, said B.I.G.

Nimble\nYou can never be me, you can only resemble\nCopped the presidential suites for weeks, ya'll just a day out\nOne ass picture in a magazine, I gets a layout\nMy nigga gone now, so who writin' my rhymes?\nNo disrespect, ya'll bitches on them publishing checks\n\nIf I'll tell ya, I'll tell ya now\n(Queen Bee, Queen Bee)\nWould you keep, just keep on feelin' me\n(Wha?

I know you pissed, but take some advice from me\nIn five years, you'll be nice as me\nBut right now, nah, ya'll ain't ready\nI'm a single black female and this goes out to Heddy\n\nIf I'll tell ya, I'll tell ya now\n(Queen Bee, Queen Bee)\nWould you keep, just keep on feelin' me\n(Wha?

pressure\nHammer man, can't touch this\nFrozen pipes, watch me bust on 'em\nStep on heads like clutches\nWatch the pipes leave the dust on 'em\nToni Braxton with the flow, hoe\nUsher Raymond with the dance moves\nNino Brown with the dope quotes\nPussy get wetter than bottled water\nI took that dick out to Bora Bora\nHe ate the booty like mahi-mahi\nMai Tais with Tahitian hotties\nMob ties with the Legion\nProbably got me moving like I'm in a movie\nActing like he knew me\nI am too elusive\nLife is too exclusive to worry\nSo I'ma just live a little\n(Yeah) I need an Oscar nomination\nBitch, I'm a living motion picture\nRolling with you\nNeed to see you speeding with a smoking pistol\nThey honor me that's no Judicial\nZebra stripes Im so official\nIf it ain't mutually beneficial\nThen what the fuck am I doing with you?\nBaby niggas like price efficient\nCut it out like Eddie Scissors\nI got the bread on me\nPaparazzi got me paranoid\nBitch, I feel like the feds on me\nClose the curtains on the 600\nCity traffic give me time to think\nThink about when I was first fronted\nI live fast with no time to blink\nI need a nigga like Malcolm X\nSeven zeros on every check\n\nI been looking for some bands\nAll summer sixteen\nAll summer sixteen\nPlaying dirty not clean\nGot the whole BK out here like a football team\nWhat the fuck you mean?\nI been looking for some

money like Blow\nCatch a body, get a face lift, disappear like Pablo\nY'all niggas think I won't jump in the heap\nWell, let's dance, you lames are finished\nI serve all y'all cowards like a game of tennis\nAct like you want some of this and I'll give you the business\nYou see the yellow and black, you know what it's about\nWrinkled assed niggas gets ironed, to straighten you out\nI got thugs in the east, thugs in the south\nThat'll stick with the AIDS needle and piss in your mouth\nI kept 'em on a leash and now it's time to let 'em out\nBetter pray to Jehovah, the game is over\nDon't ever, ever, ever, ever underestimate\nLil' Kim the poster girl at 718\nRide outta town with my nigga, holdin' his weight\nAfter it's cooked, chopped in eights the size of plates\nYou bitches ain't been through shit, you just minors\nWhat you know about stuffin' half a bricks in your vagina\nIt's the dick licker, it's the baby sipper\nAin't a bitch alive can make a nigga cum quicker\nBaby girl's pussy get wetter than a shower cap\nGot my mans back like a Jansport napsack\nAnd Queen Bee gon' bring you nothin' but heat\nHomicide is lookin' for me for killin' these beats\nYou in the wrong department, this the upper class section\nYou hoes is startin' to irritate me like a yeast infection\nGood heavens, somebody get the Monostat 7\nAnd hit me why don'tcha, hit me why don'tcha\nThe boss lady, I hold it down for my babies\nRappers better run and hide 'cause here comes the Beehive\nIt's your boy, Money Cash, I get love in the streets\nBreathin' dro colored Benz's with dutch colored seats\nLay in the crib on Tuesdays, duckin' the sweep\nNigga jump off, then get pumped off your feet\nI'm like Rostein, low key and brilliant with numbers\nI'm tryna blow sticky in Brazil with the Hummer\nIf you spittin' and I'm grippin' this tech\nThen that's 32 shots, our throwback's like Mitchell and Ness\nMan, I'm a project nigga, still piss on the steps\nAnd keep the brim on my fitted a little twist to the left\nI play the block, fifth in my sweats, reppin' my set\nIt's Rossie from the pharmacy, get it correct\n(Beehive)\nFuckin' with the Teflon bitch from the Stuy\nFuckin' with the Teflon bitch\n(Beehive)\nFuckin' with the Teflon bitch from the Stuy\n(Now putcha hands around your mouth and holler out)\n(The Beehive)\nYo, it's Bunky S to the A, and my guns ain't warm\nBeatin' niggas close to death with my house slippers on\nYou ain't a thug cocksucka, you a coward to front\nFuck your project, your building got flowers in front\nEvery chick I roll with, OZ in the cunt\nI was OT in Mass, pushin' flower for months\nSprinklin' gun powder, oughta put a haze on my blunt\nI spit a hundred and fifty bars when I'm blazin' 'em out\n'Cause I can do that with razor blades stuck in my mouth\nForget a hotel, I'm fuckin' shorty right on the couch\nAny rap shit I ever barked on, to hot to handle\nAnd my rims bigger than lower Manhattan manholes\nListen up for 2003 tan rover\nStash box hold guns like Afgan soldiers\nWanna murda 16, well we the niggas you call\nQueen Bee and Gotti Kids, muthafuck all y'all\n(Beehive)\nFuckin' with the Teflon bitch from the

earned in the streets\n'Cause my bars so hot, it be burnin' the beats\nMeltin' my pen, I have slugs meltin' your chin\nWhen I throw you over the bridge, helpin' you swim\nYou better wear a metal hat when you rappin' on stage\nOr have my bullets like  packin' your waves\nOr snatch your face off like I'm Nicolas Cage\nAnd it could be five of y'all, puttin' eight in your grave\n'Cause niggas think they hard, but they softer than bread\nWhen them shells hit your throat, you be coughin' up lead\nThe next step is to off you, dead\nI'ma cut your fuckin' neck off and have Kim auction your head\n(Beehive)\nSee the kid don't rap for love, I rap for cheques\nEven if I know you, I demand respect\nAnd if I put you in the body bag, your man is next\nThe Advakid and Queen Bee gon' leave the game in a mess\n(Beehive)\nFuckin' with the Teflon bitch from the Stuy\nFuckin' with the Teflon bitch\n(Beehive)\nFuckin' with the Teflon bitch from the Stuy\n(Now putcha hands around your mouth and holler out)\n(The Beehive)\nIt's young Goldie, the Advakid, put you to rest\nI ride around with two 38's tucked in my sweats\nA pump in trunk and a nine under the seat\nEnough ammo to blow the earth from under your feet\n(Beehive)\nAnd we got cake for killas like Hyde and Jeckyl\nSnippers put red dots on your face like freckles\nDon't make me have to reach for the lead\nYou'll think the bullets was rain drops how they all hit your head\nI'm that slim kid that they say is probably hot\nShe only with me 'cause of what she think I probably got\nAm I gon' be with her for long, probably not\nUnless you're cute and suck a dick like a lollipop\nNiggas talk about guns and they just bust caps\nNiggas talk about ki's whey they just flip packs\nWhen it come to my money, suggest you gimmie that\n'Cause you know bullets fly in pairs like Petey Pab\n(Beehive)\nFuckin' with the Teflon bitch from the Stuy\nFuckin' with the Teflon bitch\n(Beehive)\nFuckin' with the Teflon bitch from the Stuy\n(Now putcha hands around your mouth and holler out)\n(The Beehive)\nNow putcha hands around your mouth and holler out\nThe Beehive", "image":

next\nThe Advakid and Queen Bee gon' leave the game in a mess\n(Beehive)\nFuckin' with the Teflon bitch from the Stuy\nFuckin' with the Teflon bitch\n(Beehive)\nFuckin' with the Teflon bitch from the Stuy\n(Now putcha hands around your mouth and holler out)\n(The Beehive)\nIt's young Goldie, the Advakid, put you to rest\nI ride around with two 38's tucked in my sweats\nA pump in trunk and a nine under the seat\nEnough ammo to blow the earth from under your feet\n(Beehive)\nAnd we got cake for killas like Hyde and Jeckyl\nSnippers put red dots on your face like freckles\nDon't make me have to reach for the lead\nYou'll think the bullets was rain drops how they all hit your head\nI'm that slim kid that they say is probably hot\nShe only with me 'cause of what she think I probably got\nAm I gon' be with her for long, probably not\nUnless you're cute and suck a dick like a lollipop\nNiggas talk about guns and they just bust caps\nNiggas talk about ki's whey they just flip packs\nWhen it come to my money, suggest you gimmie that\n'Cause you know bullets fly in pairs like Petey Pab\n(Beehive)\nFuckin' with the Teflon bitch from the Stuy\nFuckin' with the Teflon bitch\n(Beehive)\nFuckin' with the Teflon bitch from the Stuy\n(Now putcha hands around your mouth and holler out)\n(The Beehive)\nNow putcha hands around your mouth and holler out\nThe Beehive"}},

I'm a girl, couldn't make it alone\nTime to turn the heat up and get back in the zone\nOne day my hairs orange, the next day it's green\nThe trendsetter's back on your TV screen\n\nThis is who I am

titties than the lakes\nStill a sophisticated lady with millions in the safe\nSwitch up flows like I switch up my clothes\nMore than Wilt Chamberlain switched up his hoes\nI'm a profectionist, gotta stay on my toes\nAnything goes when you play with the pro's\nI got everybody rappin' about jewelry and cars\nLil' Kim give you a platinum sixteen bars\nI'm the real thing, ya'll kareokee stars\nThis is who I am\n\n\nI'd rather be dead and rich than broke and livin'\nWithout rap, I probably woulda been sellin' dope in prison\nWith some Vera Wang khakis and Nolteychucks\nSuckin' the warden's dick in the back of the bus\nBut God made me what I am today\nSo I say things ya'll afraid to say\nJust cause you got a head start that don't make you strongest\nHe who burns last, burns the longest\nFuck what they say about me\nFact is I'm the legacy of B.I.G\nThe Queen of New York, let's get this straight\nI'm about to be elected mayor of 718\n\n\nIf you in the club\nYou are listening to the sounds\nOf the *scratch* Queen Bee baby\nRide the bar, Queen Bee baby\nMashonda on the hook\nI go by the name of... the Monster\nSwizz Beatz\nYou are listening to the Queen Bee\nBee baby", "image":

locked, eight straight summers\nBank account hold eight straight numbers, ain't no room for you whack newcomers\nWe the people's choice because we kick that, Nasty \"Hardcore\" shit that you wanna hear\nCan't fuck with us, hands down we win best murder rap of the year\nPounds to the misters, hugs for the miss, bombs in the mail, sealed with a kiss\nAll my bitches pop that thing like this, all my niggas wave that bling on the wrist\nSome of the consequences when you dealin with a plug thug\nAnd I'm backed up by the Duke, we gon' take over the world, whatchu know about Thug Luv?\n\nYou can't fuck with us; do it like a hustler, gotta keep it gangsta, can't no one collide with us\nAll my true thugs and all my real bitches, won'tcha come and ride with us\nDo it like a hustler, gotta keep it gangsta, can't no one collide with us\nAll my true thugs and all my real bitches, won'tcha come and ride with us\n Well I think so\n Well I got 'dro, now baby we can roll\n\nDo it like a gangsta, creepin like a murderer, strapped while I roll on chrome\nLookin for the ones we at war with, when we see 'em we gon' aim for your dome\n\nHear me Ma we can run this Earth together, come up worse than ever\nHavin big dreams while we back up this work together\nLet's set up shop on the block now, takin over yo' tip, even if we gotta slang dubs\nGo to war because I love blood, with a Queen by my side, whatchu know about Thug Luv?\n\nDo it like a hustler, Lil' Kim and Twista, might as well ride with us\nMale groupies, girl groupies, they're all gon' side with us\nWhatcha gon' do, it's the Duke and the Duchess, you need to give it up\nWe gon' take over the world, whatchu know about Thug Luv?\n\nYou can't fuck with us; do it like a hustler, gotta keep it gangsta, can't no one collide with us\nAll my true thugs and all my real bitches, won'tcha come and ride with us\nDo it like a hustler, gotta keep it gangsta, can't no one collide with us\nAll my true thugs and all my real bitches, won'tcha come and ride with us\n\nDo it like a hustler, Lil' Kim and Twista, might as well ride with us\nMale groupies, girl groupies, they're all gon' side with us\nWhatcha gon' do, it's the Duke and

Chanel\nAll over my frame, judge is my game\nMy nigga, he eating me, I know he need an umbrella\nAdventurous fella\nHe's going down, down underneath\nJust like a cellar\nMy sneakers are Maison Margiela (what else?)\nCountin' up like a bank teller (what else?)\nShow me one bitch who do realer\nAlways catch me with gorillas\nPockets on sumo, no sit-ups\nOn my pussy he do chin-ups\nBlanco, I'm raisin' the bar\nBetter high jump like Olympics\n\n(Aye, I'm settin' trends)\nI'm trendin' (aye)\nNo album, no single (aye)\nJust ya girl (settin' trend)\n\nI'm a rendsetter\nI do what I want, I do what I like\nI know you hate, you don't\nWhy you hatin' though?\nNot good for your health\nYou mad that I'm up\nBe mad at yourself\n\nI'm trendin'\nI'm settin' trends\nBitch, I'm settin' trends\nI'm trendin'\nI'm settin' trends\nBitch, I'm settin' trends\n\nAy, ay, so you mean to tell me\nYa'll niggas mad at us?\n'Cause, 'cause we fly, nigga?\nFuck you mean, nigga?\nWe them trendsetters\nThat's

gonna find you, and take it slowly\n\nYou know I move in silence like them gangstas taught me\nPut money on the table, pass the pepper and salt please\nMoving too fast, take it slow like R&B\nBut aren't I resisting things out on South Beach\nBlanco, Kimmy B, Urs, the same thing\nAin't shit change, going hard for the whole team\nGot niggas on my line, I ain't hanging no clothing\nA bitch been crack, just living this dope dream\nI'm talking 'bout Bulgari on the charm, Piguet on the arm\nLimited edition Giuseppes\nYou know I got the shooters from the turf that'll pop you like Percs\nI suggest you muhfuckas don't test me\nWanna eat me out, can he pay all my bills?\nForeign G-Wagon in the house on Nut Hills\nPut this pussy on you like the sun in the morning\nBeat it up, beat it up, up\n\n\nThe money coming in, I been having a good year\nI wear Prada, Balenciaga the footwear\nIf I'm in the building then you know that the hood there\nI'm spitting fire till I retire like Goodyear\nPocket full of chicken, getting that poultry\nGot niggas mad cause I'm in my bag like groceries\nMy team wild, better watch how you approach me\nI get a OG to punch you right in your gold teeth\nYo, I'm wit' my girl Kim, girlfriend go harder than grown men\nShe bad wit' a Hermes bag bringing the chrome in\nI go hard but I make it look easy\nWhenever you see me, I'm ballin' like CP3\n\n\nYou can't run away, yeah\nFrom the truth, oh no no, baby, yeah baby\nIt's gonna catch up to you one day\nKim and Cassidy\nWe got these streets lit baby, yeah baby\nWe run shit from Brooklyn

in this motherfucker to get up out their seat)\nLadies and gentlemen, without further adieu\n(It's our time)\nI'd like to introduce to you, my bitch\n\nFuck that, bitches don't deserve to rap\nI'm back, and I'm about to murder cats\nTrying to take my crown, I ain't letting that go down\nI cop the four pound and go the whole twelve rounds, yeah\nYou broke hoes need to throw in the towel\nLife's a wheel of fortune and y'all can't buy a vowel\nWho me? That's none of your concern\nLike ashes in the urn, more money to burn\nDamn my ass is firm, stay away from germs\nPussy flawless, get wetter than worms\nIf you only knew like Aaliyah\nHow your man be hawking me and stalking me\nWhen he fucking you he see me\nEvery crack vial or record he sell I get a piecey\nEasy, believe me, my words is credible\nAsk Nat Cole huh, I'm unforgettable\nDon't let the QB get a hold of your guy\nSex him well, get him high, he might fuck around and die\n\nI guess you know by now who's number one\nBrooklyn, Brooklyn that's where I'm from\n(Number one)\nSo if you got beef, you better think again\n(Number one)\nCause you can't win\n(You can't win)\nI guess you know by now who's number one\nBrooklyn, Brooklyn that's where I'm from\n(Number one)\nSo if you got beef, you better think again\n(Number one)\nCause you can't win\n(You can't win)\n\nYour so-called vendetta was light like bird feathers\nEven with an umbrella, you can't stop my hurricane\nI moved on to bigger and better things\nY'all still making minimum wage\nFirst on stage, like the Ever I glazed\nLeave you amazed, and keep the fifth by the rib cage\nAll you jealous ass hoes', rebellious ass hoes'\nStill trying to recoup off the first album ass hoes'\nYou a gangster? Prove it. Wanna shoot me? Do it\nThat's word to Jerry McGuire, I'll set that ass on fire\nTie you up with barbed wire, carve my name in your face\nPour gasoline on you, drop you at the gas station\nY'all chicks ain't blind, I shine like polyurethane\nCocoa butter cream, vaseline and drugs baby like codeine\nLow self-esteem? Uh-uh, the flow is excellent\nYours is satisfactory, return them to the factory\nI mean practically, the shit is wack to me\nMama bear, finally out of hibernating\nHere to tell you chicks to stop tail-gating\n\nI guess you know by now who's number one\nBrooklyn, Brooklyn that's where I'm from\n(Number one)\nSo if you got beef, you better think again\n(Number one)\nCause you can't win\n(You can't win)\nI guess you know by now who's number one\nBrooklyn, Brooklyn that's where I'm from\n(Number one)\nSo if you got beef, you better think again\n(Number one)\nCause you can't win\n(You can't win)\n\nIt's the B-I-G-M-A-M-A\nOften tipsy, cabin in Poughkeepsie\nI've been in this shit since Biz hit the\nOne-two, nothing left to do\nMove it in there, cathedral ceilings\nDon't come to my house, it might hurt your feelings\nP.Diddy introduced me to the business side\nSpotted me a few mill and a couple of oil spills\nThat's how we do it, you chicks is no frills\nDoin' it Flinstones style, car with no wheels\nStealin' tricycles, ridin' bicycles\nOur diamonds be so white they look like icicles\nI'm getting sick and tired of hearing all these rough drafts\nOn the countdown (giggles) - don't make me laugh\nGot my own company, I'm chief of the staff\nThey say we twins, then I'm the better half\nI'm nasty! Worse than Howard Stern\nThis court is adjourned, and now it's your turn, bitch!\n\nI guess you know by now who's number one\nBrooklyn, Brooklyn that's where I'm from\n(Number one)\nSo if you got beef, you better think again\n(Number one)\nCause you can't win\n(You can't win)\nI guess you know by now who's number one\nBrooklyn, Brooklyn that's where I'm from\n(Number one)\nSo if you got beef, you better think again\n(Number one)\nCause you can't win\n(You can't win)\n\nCan you feel me?\nI just wanna know if y'all can feel me\nI just wanna know if y'all can feel me out there\nIt's not a game, we're back\nAnd this time we're not going anywhere\nNumber one, that's my bitch\nRecognize!

down\nBaby boy let me fill you in\nI can tell that you're built to win\nLet me \nChoke me \nI am oh so into you\nLet me fuck you slow\nPlease don't let me go\nI just might fall in love with you\n\nWhat'd you have for lunch today baby?\nWould you like dessert?\nGot my schoolgirl skirt on\nI'm about to give you brain like a nerd\nNow baby can you take me down\nCause I been out for way too long\nYou know these drinks got me too gone\nYou know this weed smoke got me on\n\n\nWhat you need work? I could give you that employment\nHalf a million dollar coupe just for my enjoyment\nBitch I got that work, el trabajo\nIf I run out I just hit Pablo\nMi no play no games, mi no come with console\nMi too wild in these streets, no control\nForty on me now and your nigga is the driver\nHe left you because your pussy was too dried up\nAnd I got him mind fucked\nG500 truck\nHundred thousand dollar shopping spree and I ain't bought him nothing\nRollies with the bezel on it\nPJ with the medal on me\nHop up out the jet in a Bugatti\nIt's the one and only Queen Bee nigga, if it's about my cheese\nI need a CC nigga if you sending that word out\nIt's like the cops raiding, how I'm sending them birds out\nTen toes down, I'm that bitch that you heard 'bout\nFucking with this pussy I could put you on the map\nFucking with this pussy I could take you out the trap\nYeah I rock Giusseppes, but Louboutins mi prefer\nLet him purr on my kitty and buy mami some furs"}}, {"title": "Work the Pole",

in my stash\nDudes dates girls who try to be like me\nMy pimp game so good make you leave wifey\nNew York's finest, call me Your Highness\nAnd know there's a method to my madness"}}], "artist": "Lil' Kim"}
