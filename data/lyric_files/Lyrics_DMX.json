It's four in the mornin!)\nSent him out of state with like half a brick down to my spot in VA\nCause the money comes quick\nHalf of that got fucked up before I even got the check in on him\nBut things happen so I really wasn't wreckin' on him\nGot him up out of there and sent him down a little further\nAin't heard from him in two months, murder, murder (aahhh!)\nAnd from the next flight thinking I might have to steal something\nThis hungry shit will make a nigga wanna kill something (fo-fo!)\nI gots to make a move and make it soon (uh-huh!)\nI gots to take a block and make it boom (come on!)\nI gots to make a move and make it soon (what?)\nI gots to take a block and make it boom (come on!)\nMan, listen, money is missing and shit is hectic\nFound the safe, checked it\nShit looks detected\nJust what I expected when I got no word from him\nAsked around but ain't nobody heard from him (cash long!)\nBut money talks and most niggas is snakes\nSo it wasn't long before his man was ready to take\nMe to where he was at, checked my gat\nThrew in a four clip, pumped myself up\nCause I can't go for that bullshit\nFuckin' with my last load of cash ain't the issue\nIt's just real fucked up when your man tries to diss you\nTakin' back for niggas in New York and how they told me so\nNow I got to knock his boots, he owes me dough\nLayin' up with a hoe, then he hit me with the sob story\nThe famous \"Oh you didn't know I got robbed!\" story\nTold it's to me he should be grateful to\nFuck that bitch! Look at what she made you do\nNow there's love lost and a double cross\nPointed at that bitch, turned her braids into sauce\nSo you wanna be with him (uh) and talk to me like I'm silly\nFive bottle of Mo on the floor, boxes of phillys\nTen g's in the shoebox under the bed\nAnd for every g I put a fuckin' slug in his head\nAnd from then, the moral of the story if you missed it\nIs the grand is always gonna be there (why nigga?)\nJust never go against it"}}, {"title": "Ain't No Way", "album": "Flesh of My Flesh, Blood of My Blood", "year": "1998-12-22", "lyrics": "Uhh\nSwizz beats (Uhh uhh)\nNigga, ryde or die (uhh uhh uhh)\nDMX what what (uhh uhh uhh)\n\nAin't no way you're gonna stop my flow\nAin't no way ya niggas you just don't know\nBut niggas is about to go oh no oh no\nAin't no way you're gonna stop my shine\nAin't no way you niggas wanna stop mine\nYa niggas must be out yo mind, I don't know why\nWhat the fuck is you niggas pressin me for\nI saw more ass than a ho and you stressin the raw\nIf I was testin your jaw, maybe then you would respect me\nBut you can't respect me cuz you dont even know me\nNigga check me (come on)\nI'm that motherfucker that'll put you to sleep, while you sleepin\nRed dot from a hundred feet, you just knew you was creepin\nBad decisions lead to last decisions\nFast collision, now yo ass is missin (what)\nTake it over there now you bring it back to the streets\nHave you forgotten what it means when a dog shows his teeth?\nLet me break it down for you he's about to attack you\nStill standin here faggot?

way you're gonna stop my flow\nAin't no way ya niggas you just don't know\nBut niggas is about to go oh no oh no\nAin't no way you're gonna stop my shine\nAin't no way you niggas wanna stop mine\nYa niggas must be out yo mind, I don't know why\nWhat the fuck is you niggas pressin me for\nI saw more ass than a ho and you stressin the raw\nIf I was testin your jaw, maybe then you would respect me\nBut you can't respect me cuz you dont even know me\nNigga check me (come on)\nI'm that motherfucker that'll put you to sleep, while you sleepin\nRed dot from a hundred feet, you just knew you was creepin\nBad decisions lead to last decisions\nFast collision, now yo ass is missin (what)\nTake it over there now you bring it back to the streets\nHave you forgotten what it means when a dog shows his teeth?\nLet me break it down for you he's about to attack you\nStill standin here faggot? You must want me to smack you\nYou ain't been there or done that, fuck is y'all niggas tellin me\nI'm the only nigga, walkin the streets with four felonies\nBut peep this, I see shit is hard, niggas is strugglin\nLeave rap alone for a little while, go back to hustlin\n\nGive it to niggas just how they give it to, me\nHit em in a rhyme because I'm a MC\nBeen a lot of places most niggas won't, see\nThat's why I'm at a level that y'all niggas won't, be\nLet your man hold somethin now he want, more\nYou ain't no fuckin killer what was the front, for\nIt was a time when the world was at your front, door\nNow they change places niggas want, raw\nNiggas laugh at me and was mad at me\nCuz the way life was goin had to be a, tragedy\nBut after me, it's over, I'mma take the whole verse\nI'm tryin to keep it real that's why I let y'all niggas go first\nBut you looked a gift horse right in the mouth\nDidn't appreciate what you got when you got it\nSo if I see it, I'mma dot it, where to hide it\nYou gotta car better drive it the fuck up outta here\nAnd hope and pray I don't pull up alongside it\nCOME ON\n\nNiggas don't know so I gotta flip\nIt seem they've forgotten how dark it could get\nBarks like a pit scratch when I hit\nWe both know you pussy but you stay talkin shit\nWhat I'mma have to do dog, run up in yo mess\nCatch you while you comfortable put one up in yo chest\nOne up in yo vest, of course they the hollows\nYou goin' away today, you just lost tomorrow\nI'mma go platinum (nah) you gots to be kiddin WHY\nMake it double platinum, no bullshittin\nAnd I'mma stay flippin flows, rippin shows\nStrippin ho's, gettin dough let me go\nAnd nigaz know, who the best is\nThe dog, DMX is the rest is or might as well be helpless\nI wreck this cuz when I wreck shit\nI might snatch a niggas necklace\nThen go from like midnight to breakfast\nCOME ON"}}, {"title": "Ain't Nowhere To Hide", "album": null, "year": null, "lyrics": "In progress...feel free to add lyrics",

bitch\nAlready\nWanna be gangsta and a snitch\nAlready\nWhat part of the game is this!?\nAlready\nY'all know how I get down\nAlready\nRing bells when I hit town (ding, ding, ding)\nStraight up I lay shit down\nAlready\nWhat bitch I lay shit now\nAlready\nDog off the leash again\nAlready\nAsk around in the streets I'mma win\nAlready\nCOME ON!"}}, {"title": "A Minute for Your Son", "album": "The

the process?\nGod loves you, yes he does, said you're alright with him\nI wonder\u2026\n\nI know you've never seen him\nBut don't fight with him\nYou're gonna make it through the night\nTo the light with him\nYou're alright with him\nI said you're alright with him\nI know you've never seen him\nBut don't fight with him\nYou're gonna make it through the night\nTo the light with him\nYou're alright with him\nI said you're alright with him\n\nI'm callin' out to you, Lord, because I need your help\nSee, once again I'm havin' difficulty savin' myself\nBehavin' myself, you told me what to do, and I do it\nBut every and now and then it gets a little harder to go through it\nLosin' friends day by day\nI'm in so much pain when I'm here, Lord, please take me away!\nI put you here to do a job, and your work ain't done\nTo live is to suffer, but you're still my son\nAnd there will be a time when you shine as bright as the stars\nBut there won't be a his or hers, just ours\nThen you'll see what I've been tryin' to show you all these years\nDo the right thing, 'cause after the tears come the cheers\nI will, my Lord, with my heart and my soul\nThat's gonna be how I roll, from now until I mold\nLead and I'll follow, you take away the sorrow\nI'ma sleep on what you said and holla back tomorrow\n\nI know you've never seen him\nBut don't fight with him\nYou're gonna make it through the night\nTo the light with him\nUhh, you're alright with him\nI said you're alright with him\nI know you've never seen him\nBut don't fight with him\nYou're gonna make it through the night\nTo the light with him\nUhh, you're alright with him\nI said you're alright with him\n\nI want you to know, Lord, that for what you given me I'm thankful\nSincerely, from the bottom of my heart, I'm grateful\nYou gave us power in our words, so I think before I speak\nAnd that way when I speak, they know I'm here to teach\nCan't tell 'em nothin' wrong, 'cause I love 'em too much\nI reach a lot of people, and Lord, I'm lovin' the touch\nBut deep inside, I've got somethin' that's workin' against\nEverything I know is right, what I know makes sense\nThat's when you must fight harder than you've ever fought before\n'Cause what you've got goin' on inside you is a war\nBetween good and evil, be careful of those who wanna be you\nThey smile but are not really happy when they see you\nBe careful of the ones that always wanna get you high\n'Cause when the time comes, that one'll let you die\nListen to me! I'm here, but I can only help you\nIf you want me to help, what do you want for yourself?\n\nI know you've never seen him\nBut don't fight with him\nYou're gonna make it through the night\nTo the light with him\nYou're alright with him\nI said you're alright with him\nI know you've never seen him\nBut don't fight with him\nYou're gonna make it through the night\nTo the light with him\nYou're alright with him\nI said you're alright with him\n\nMy Lord, my savior, don't judge my behavior, but instead\nTake what's in my heart and put it in my head\nSee, I guess I really never knew how proud I made you\nMy life is yours, my soul I gave you\nI don't know if I'll do good enough (He's by your side)\nAnd we both know the hood is rough (Right by your side)\nSometimes I don't know what to do (X, dry your eyes!)\nBut I know what I gotta do (It'll be alright)\nYou keep givin' me the word, and I'll put it to song\nTalk to me, I'll talk to them, and we can't go wrong\nThis is the start of somethin' strong, and this is just the start of it\nPraises to you, my Lord, for lettin' me be a part of it\nI was that kid that, been there, did that\nBecame ashamed so I hid that, but ain't no longer with that\nUse me as an example\u2014if I can do it, then they can too\nWith the Lord behind us, there ain't nothin' that we can't do\n\nI know you've never seen him\nBut don't fight with him\nYou're gonna make it through the night\nTo the light with him (The light with him)\nYou're alright with him ('Cause he loves you)\nI said you're alright with him\nI know you've never seen him\nBut don't fight with him\nYou're gonna make it through the night\nTo the light with him\nUhh, you're alright with him ('Cause he loves you)\nI said you're alright with him\n\nHe's by your side\nRight by your side\nX, dry your eyes!\n'Cause it'll be alright\nYeah, he's by your side\nRight by your side\nX, dry your eyes!\n'Cause, it's gonna be alright\nYeah yeah, yes it is!", "image": "https://images.genius.com/57efb548310ed90e73d9200fd01a3e59.630x630x1.jpg", "artist": "DMX", "raw": {"annotation_count": 11, "api_path": "/songs/17429", "description": {"dom": {"tag": "root", "children": [{"tag": "p", "children": ["The 2nd sequel to ", {"tag": "a", "attributes": {"href": "https://genius.com/Dmx-the-convo-lyrics"}, "data": {"api_path": "/songs/17467"}, "children": ["The Convo"]}, " , the 1st sequel being ", {"tag": "a", "attributes": {"href": "https://genius.com/Dmx-ready-to-meet-him-lyrics"}, "data": {"api_path": "/songs/17480"}, "children": ["Ready to Meet Him"]}, "."]}, "", {"tag": "p", "children": ["In all three tracks, DMX seems to have lost his way and calls out to his savior for guidance.

he does, said you're alright with him\nI wonder\u2026\n\nI know you've never seen him\nBut don't fight with him\nYou're gonna make it through the night\nTo the light with him\nYou're alright with him\nI said you're alright with him\nI know you've never seen him\nBut don't fight with him\nYou're gonna make it through the night\nTo the light with him\nYou're alright with him\nI said you're alright with him\n\nI'm callin' out to you, Lord, because I need your help\nSee, once again I'm havin' difficulty savin' myself\nBehavin' myself, you told me what to do, and I do it\nBut every and now and then it gets a little harder to go through it\nLosin' friends day by day\nI'm in so much pain when I'm here, Lord, please take me away!\nI put you here to do a job, and your work ain't done\nTo live is to suffer, but you're still my son\nAnd there will be a time when you shine as bright as the stars\nBut there won't be a his or hers, just ours\nThen you'll see what I've been tryin' to show you all these years\nDo the right thing, 'cause after the tears come the cheers\nI will, my Lord, with my heart and my soul\nThat's gonna be how I roll, from now until I mold\nLead and I'll follow, you take away the sorrow\nI'ma sleep on what you said and holla back tomorrow\n\nI know you've never seen him\nBut don't fight with him\nYou're gonna make it through the night\nTo the light with him\nUhh, you're alright with him\nI said you're alright with him\nI know you've never seen him\nBut don't fight with him\nYou're gonna make it through the night\nTo the light with him\nUhh, you're alright with him\nI said you're alright with him\n\nI want you to know, Lord, that for what you given me I'm thankful\nSincerely, from the bottom of my heart, I'm grateful\nYou gave us power in our words, so I think before I speak\nAnd that way when I speak, they know I'm here to teach\nCan't tell 'em nothin' wrong, 'cause I love 'em too much\nI reach a lot of people, and Lord, I'm lovin' the touch\nBut deep inside, I've got somethin' that's workin' against\nEverything I know is right, what I know makes sense\nThat's when you must fight harder than you've ever fought before\n'Cause what you've got goin' on inside you is a war\nBetween good and evil, be careful of those who wanna be you\nThey smile but are not really happy when they see you\nBe careful of the ones that always wanna get you high\n'Cause when the time comes, that one'll let you die\nListen to me! I'm here, but I can only help you\nIf you want me to help, what do you want for yourself?\n\nI know you've never seen him\nBut don't fight with him\nYou're gonna make it through the night\nTo the light with him\nYou're alright with him\nI said you're alright with him\nI know you've never seen him\nBut don't fight with him\nYou're gonna make it through the night\nTo the light with him\nYou're alright with him\nI said you're alright with him\n\nMy Lord, my savior, don't judge my behavior, but instead\nTake what's in my heart and put it in my head\nSee, I guess I really never knew how proud I made you\nMy life is yours, my soul I gave you\nI don't know if I'll do good enough (He's by your side)\nAnd we both know the hood is rough (Right by your side)\nSometimes I don't know what to do (X, dry your eyes!)\nBut I know what I gotta do (It'll be alright)\nYou keep givin' me the word, and I'll put it to song\nTalk to me, I'll talk to them, and we can't go wrong\nThis is the start of somethin' strong, and this is just the start of it\nPraises to you, my Lord, for lettin' me be a part of it\nI was that kid that, been there, did that\nBecame ashamed so I hid that, but ain't no longer with that\nUse me as an example\u2014if I can do it, then they can too\nWith the Lord behind us, there ain't nothin' that we can't do\n\nI know you've never seen him\nBut don't fight with him\nYou're gonna make it through the night\nTo the light with him (The light with him)\nYou're alright with him ('Cause he loves you)\nI said you're alright with him\nI know you've never seen him\nBut don't fight with him\nYou're gonna make it through the night\nTo the light with him\nUhh, you're alright with him ('Cause he loves you)\nI said you're alright with him\n\nHe's by your side\nRight by your side\nX, dry your eyes!\n'Cause it'll be alright\nYeah, he's by your side\nRight by your side\nX, dry your eyes!\n'Cause, it's gonna be alright\nYeah yeah, yes it is!"}}, {"title": "Any MC", "album": "Unleashed & Unreleased", "year": "1998-01-01", "lyrics": "Ayo, ayo, ayo, ayo!\nThere's wild MCs that day,  you knowmsayin\nI give props to, niggas is nice, you knowmsayin?\nBut on the real, y'all niggas know!\nThat them niggas is not fuckin with me\nYou knowmsayin?\nAny MC that disagree with me\nWave your motherfuckin arm\nCuz it can happen!\nIt ain't no secret 'bout how its going down once I put on the pressure\nIt ain't nothing but another nigga put on a stretcher\nWith a blanket over his face, take him to the morgue with the waste\n'Cuz he was in the wrong place at the wrong time\nSo I gave it to him in his chest\nIn his throat, in his head, in his back, through his vest, yes\nAin't a whole lot to braking a nigga down fast\nThey call me black 'cuz thats how I'm gon' be on that ass\nY'all pussy niggas think y'all sweet\nBut ain't a fuckin thing going down til I eat\nSo can I beef?

Get at me\nMy baby motha be buggin soon as I walked in the door\nGot me like \"Yo, I ain't fuckin with that bitch no more\"\nShe know i love her but I can't fuck with her\nShe thinkin cause we got a kid together, I'm stuck with her\nMy baby motha be buggin soon as I walked in the door\nGot me like \"Yo, I ain't fuckin with that bitch no more\"\nShe know i love her but I can't fuck with her\nShe

niggas know the story\nAnd that everything is lovely when it's all about the glory\nBut soon as shit hit the fan, honies be wanna take the kid and scram\nI'm having bad thoughts, don't like how dark it's getting man\nFrom the time I wake up and get dressed\nI get stressed, and hardly ever get rest\nIt's 96, so I'm on some different shit cousin\nShe ain't gon have me liftin through that riffin shit cousin\nI got moves to make and mad shit to do\nHer friends are looking good so I might hit the crew\nIt's like one and two that might get a nigga that big and happy\nAnd I know them bitches will fuck me cause when I see 'em, they be winkin at me\nYou listenin thinkin that's a crazy brother\nBut I'm gon have to be a father who ain't fuckin with his baby motha\nMy baby motha be buggin soon as I

stuck with her\nBitches be callin the cops, thinkin they callin the shots\nTakin the dude with the bag, baby it's all in the pops\nSo do yo thing, cause I'm doin mine boo\nA nigga just been chillin, I been doin fine, and you?\nI kicked it with my honey and she put me on to something\nYou gon think until you really see me gon, I'm frontin\nMaybe if you kept your friends of respectable distance\nOut of our business, I wouldn't have to come and visit\nI thought you knew, let the shit you like switchin clothes\nWhen them bitches through, ain't to co sure when they home\nBut that ain't never stopped yo ass from passin on the Guess\nAskin for that Cougie sweater, patten up the breast\nPatten up the butt, but you think niggas is stupid\nLast week yo shit was like the dog, look at it now, too big\nI ain't gon blow yo shit no more, I shouldn't be even did that\nCause you my baby motha, and I'ma always hit that\nMy baby motha be buggin soon as I walked in the door\nGot me like \"Yo, I ain't fuckin

the door\nGot me like \"Yo, I ain't fuckin with this bitch no more\"\nGive me a Puerto Rican honey that cook rice and beans\nAnd hair down to her ass, who looks nice in them jeans\nSo I can be like \"Damn, you looking good and I wanna fuck you\"\nBut you a chicken so when I'm finish, I got a duck you\nYou layin like up you don't wanna leave\nI told you I got a girl but you don't wanna believe\nMy baby's mother be buggin and if you wanna see what honey do\nBe here when she get back, she bless you with the twenty-two\nBut ain't even fuck with her like that\nCuz i know, this is the only thing that make her fight that\nIf you a schemin nigga, go head try your hand\nShe might give the number, but you'll never be the man\nEven if you get the pussy ???\nMy baby motha be buggin soon as I walked in the door\nGot me like \"Yo, I ain't fuckin with that bitch no more\"\nShe know i love her but I can't fuck with her\nShe thinkin cause we got a kid together, I'm stuck with her\nMy baby

kid with no gun and no mask\nCatch a nigga out the door slippin' that's yo ass\nDidn't laugh much cause I didn't have much\nLife was like a stick half gas half clutch\nMeaning half good and half bad\nIt was good if I caught a good vic if I didn't I was bad\nTook it out on my regulars\nI'd come through and if niggas was broke I took watches and cellulars\nWent to jail a few times but that didn't stop me\nAll it taught me was how not to be sloppy\nAn older cat robbed me when I was like 10\nIf anybody wanted to help they should've did it then\nBut they didn't and all it did was release the beast\nSo I'm a feast on whatever I come across in the streets\n (DMX)\nLike the wind (like the wind)\nGod will take (god will take)\nAll my sins (all of my sins)\nBlown away (will be blown

came thought with just me and my dog\nAnd clear out the whole fuck block cause we when hard\nI bag some niggas I knew and some niggas I didn't\nI ain't a fuck either way it was no bullshiting\nI'm a cruddy niggas out to get money\nAnd a couple of slugs is the only thing anybody took from me\nRun up on a cat smooth like put it in his left ear\nGive up the money the jewelry or get left here\nKeep thinking it's a game we'll play let's get popped\nSee how much fun you having when your heart beat stop\nShut 'em down open up shop oh-oh no-oh blow off a nigga top\nSomebody call the cops but it's to late\nCause I'm a hit you in the face\nAnd what will kill you will be something that you ate\n (DMX)\nLike the wind (like the wind)\nGod will take (god will take)\nAll my sins (all of my sins)\nBlown

days\nSame clothes, no soap or shave\nAnd I still got a gun on my hip for your open grave\nWe used to get robbery vics\nUntil my man got killed for his whip on some robbery shit\nThen I switched to the weed and start selling crack\nBut I will pull a steel and put a shell up in ya back\nI feel like all my life I was held up in a trap\nLike if I go to heaven maybe hell will want me back\nBut all I really want is (unknown)\nAnd a model bitch sitting with a head up in my lap\nBut since no dough don't spin\n(unkown)\nIt's obvious I live in a house of sin\nI wish I could open up the door and let

me \"homie\"\nUsed to have a family, now I'm out on my own\nHad to scrap with a pit because I tried to take his bone\nBitches don't like me, they don't kiss me or hug me\nThey call me \"kill pretty\" because I'm mad ugly\nI used to get pussy, but I busted off quick\nNow I gets none so I gotta beat my dick\nTimes are hard in the ghetto, I gotta steal for a living\nEating turkey-flavored Now & Laters for Thanksgiving\nIf that ain't enough, life is rough I swear\nI don't have an address so I can't get welfare\nThey kicked me out the shelter because they said I smelled a\nLittle like the living dead and looked like Helter Skelter\nMy clothes are so funky, they're bad for my health\nSometimes at night my pants go to the bathroom by themself\nEven when I was little nothing went my way\nI got beat up and chased home from school every day\nAnd despite the fact I want all the brothers bees\nOn my report card, I didn't get F's, I got C's\nBut for those who choose to snooze\nCause I was born with no hope, I got nothing to lose\n\nYoung man went out and made a name for himself\nYoung man went out and made a name for himself\nYoung man went out and made a name for himself\n\nThe born loser, a title I was branded with\nWent to Liberty Island, and got stranded with\nThe Statue of Liberty, but they didn't really have to\nLeave my black ass there until the day after\nNo time for laughter, this shit's for real\nRibs are showing through my back cause I haven't had a meal\nIn a week, you can see bones in my hands\nThe raccoons beat me to the garbage cans\nI'm starving Marvin, and it shouldn't be like that\nThe only thing that I'm carving is an alley cat\nBut sometimes in the daytimes I dream of a Manwich\nBut all I'm really eating is an oxygen sandwich\nFor those that don't know, that's two pieces of bread strapped together\nOr I'll have a rain sandwich, depending on the weather\nBorn Loser caught up in the game\nAnd I ain't even got nobody to blame\n\n\nThe Born Loser, yeah, that used to me my M-O\nWhen I couldn't get a soul to listen to my demo\nDoors shut in my face until I started jamming them\nI'm behind the doors now and I'm the one slamming them\nI did what I had to to get where I got\nThough I'll admit what I had to do was a lot\nI gave it a shot, and sometimes I had to shoot\nCatching vics just to get a little loot\nI thought it was cute and didn't care who knew\nMess around, get in my way and I'll bag you, too\nCause I was born to lose straight from the beginning\nIn the dugout because I struck out the first inning\nWinning was everything, that's why I had to\nAsk my man to find the loot, and he said \"I'd be glad to\"\nNow who needs a major label?

because I'm mad ugly\nI used to get pussy, but I busted off quick\nNow I gets none so I gotta beat my dick\nTimes are hard in the ghetto, I gotta steal for a living\nEating turkey-flavored Now & Laters for Thanksgiving\nIf that ain't enough, life is rough I swear\nI don't have an address so I can't get welfare\nThey kicked me out the shelter because they said I smelled a\nLittle like the living dead and looked like Helter Skelter\nMy clothes are so funky, they're bad for my health\nSometimes at night my pants go to the bathroom by themself\nEven when I was little nothing went my way\nI got beat up and chased home from school every day\nAnd despite the fact I want all the brothers bees\nOn my report card, I didn't get F's, I got C's\nBut for those who choose to snooze\nCause I was born with no hope, I got nothing to lose\n\nYoung man went out and made a name for himself\nYoung man went out and made a name for himself\nYoung man went out and made a name for himself\n\nThe born loser, a title I was branded with\nWent to Liberty Island, and got stranded with\nThe Statue of Liberty, but they didn't really have to\nLeave my black ass there until the day after\nNo time for laughter, this shit's for real\nRibs are showing through my back cause I haven't had a meal\nIn a week, you can see bones in my hands\nThe raccoons beat me to the garbage cans\nI'm starving Marvin, and it shouldn't be like that\nThe only thing that I'm carving is an alley cat\nBut sometimes in the daytimes I dream of a Manwich\nBut all I'm really eating is an oxygen sandwich\nFor those that don't know, that's two pieces of bread strapped together\nOr I'll have a rain sandwich, depending on the weather\nBorn Loser caught up in the game\nAnd I ain't even got nobody to blame\n\n\nThe Born Loser, yeah, that used to me my M-O\nWhen I couldn't get a soul to listen to my demo\nDoors shut in my face until I started jamming them\nI'm behind the doors now and I'm the one slamming them\nI did what I had to to get where I got\nThough I'll admit what I had to do was a lot\nI gave it a shot, and sometimes I had to shoot\nCatching vics just to get a little loot\nI thought it was cute and didn't care who knew\nMess around, get in my way and I'll bag you, too\nCause I was born to lose straight from the beginning\nIn the dugout because I struck out the first inning\nWinning was everything, that's why I had to\nAsk my man to find the loot, and he said \"I'd be glad to\"\nNow who needs a major label? We got our own\nI'm the Divine Master of the Unknown\nAin't nothing changed, I'm the same as before\nWhen opportunity knocked I just answered the door\nCriminal at heart even though I don't show it\nI

away we go (we go we go we go)\nSome old born loser type of shit (shit)\nOn the remix tip (tip, tip)\nDr. Seuss (Seuss Seuss Suess)\nThe Born Loser, not because I choose to be\nBut because all the bad shit happens to me\nI got kids, but their mothers don't want them to know me\nSisters use to like me, but now they call me homie\nUse to have a family now I'm out on my own\nHad to scrap with the Pitt, cause I tried to take his bone\nBitches don't like me, they don't kiss me or hug me\nThey call me Kill-pretty, because I'm mad ugly\nI use to get pussy, but I busted off quick\nNow I gets none, so I gotta beat my dick\nTime are hard in the ghetto, I steal for a living\nEatin turkey flavored Now or Laters for thanksgiving\nIf that ain't enough, life is rough, I swear\nI don't have an address so I can't get welfare\nThey kicked me out the shelter\nBecause they said I smelled a little like the living dead\nAnd look like helter skelter\nMy clothes are so funky, they bad for my health\nSometimes at night my pants go to the bathroom by their self\nEven when I was little nothin went my way\nI got beat up, and chased home from school every day\nAnd despite the fact I won all the spelling bees\nOn my report card, I didn't get F's, I got C's\nBut for those who choose to snooze\nSince I was born with no hope, I ain't got nothin to lose...\nYoung man went out and made a name for himself\nYoung man went out and made a name for himself\nYoung man went out and made a name for himself\nCheck check check it out\nVerse 2\nThe Born Loser, a title I was branded with\nWent to Liberty Island, and got stranded with\nThe Statue of Liberty, but they really didn't hafta\nLeave my black ass there till the day after\nNo time for laughter, this shit's for real\nRibs are showin through my back, cause I haven't had a meal\nIn about a week, you can see bones in my hands\nThe racoons, beat me to the garbage cans\nI'm Starvin Marvin, and it shouldn't be like that\nThe only thing that I'm carvin, is an alley cat\nBut sometimes in the daytime\nI daydream of a Manwich\nWhen all I'm really eatin is an oxygen sandwich\nFor those that don't know\nThats 2 peices of bread slapped together\nOr I'll have a rain sandwich, depending on the weather\nBorn loser, caught up in the game\nAnd I ain't even got nobody to blame..\nYoung man went out and made a name for himself\nYoung man went out and made a name for himself\nYoung man went out and made a name for himself\nThe Born Loser, yeah, that use to be my m o\nWhen I couldn't get a soul, to listen to my demo\nDoors shut in my face, until I started jammin 'em\nI'm behind the doors now, but I'm the one slammin 'em\nI did what I had to, to get where I got\nThough I'll admit, what I had to do was a lot\nI still gave it a shot, and sometimes I had to shoot\nCatchin vicks just to get a little loot\nI thought it was cute, and didn't care who knew\nMess around get in my way and I'd bag you too\nCause I was, born to lose, straight from the beginning\nHit the dugout, because I struck out the 1st inning\nWinning, was everything, thats why I had to ask\nMy man to front me the loot, and he said I'd be glad to\nNow, who needs a major label, we got our own\nI'm the divine master of the unknown\nAin't nothin changed, I'm the same as before\nWhen opportunity knocks, I'd just answer the door\nBut criminal at heart, even though I don't show it\nI was always a winner I just didn't know it (know it)\nYoung man went out and made a name for himself\nYoung man went out and made a name for himself\nYoung man went out and made a name for himself\nBorn Loser\nDMX the great"}}, {"title": "Bring the Noize", "album": "Grand Champ", "year": "2003-09-16", "lyrics": "I smell pussy!

sweet\nUh, uh, uh all you catz don't know\nRepeat 1\nYeah baby, shit's about to jump off and\nLookin' for the bus to bring in my man from up north\nBeen like three years since when got knocked\nSince he got caught\nPunked up like five new blocks, holding down for it\nKept a nigga straight with money in the books\nAnd them bitches is crooks who look out for other crooks\nTook him shopping, money in his pocket is straight\nDropped him off at the wife's crib after we ate\nOur estate was the next move for me\nHad to make that nigga chill for at least two to three months\nCause when it's on, it's on\nHe didn't care\nIt's like slow down baby\nThe money ain't going nowhere\nKeep in touch though and show how much your ass is with it\nThe dope flow is there and in a minute you can get it (come on)\nYou gotta watch a nigga just coming home in a game\nCause on the low we may just be trying to go against the grain\nRepeat 1 (2x)\nI never figured this nigga would pull this shit that he pulled\nWhat is strange is the change that niggas go through\nWhen they're locked down and really can't hack it\nA motherfucker like me handles a bid like a jacket\nStrap it on my back, niggas ain't built like me\nAnd by the end, niggas was like \"Yo, why you killed Mike, D?\"\nWasn't me, but yeah he had it coming to him\nUsed to be my dog, so I let my cousin do him\nSent him out of state with like half a brick down to my spot in VA\nCause the money comes quick\nHalf of that got fucked up before I even got the check in on him (damn)\nBut things happen so I really wasn't wreckin' on him (damn)\nGot him up out of there and sent him down a little further\nAin't heard from him in two months, murder, murder\nAnd from the next flight thinking I might have to steal something\nThis hungry shit will make a nigga wanna kill something (come on)\nRepeat 1 (2x)\nListen, money is missing and it's hectic (what?)\nFound the safe, checked it\nShit looks detected (what?)\nJust what I expected when I got no word from him\nAsked around but ain't nobody heard from him (uh-huh)\nBut money talks and most niggas is snakes\nSo it wasn't long before his man was ready to take\nMe to where he was at, checked my gat\nThrew in a four clip, pumped myself up\nCause I can't go for that bullshit (come on)\nFuckin' with my last load of cash ain't the issue\nIt's just real fucked up when your man tries to diss you\nTakin' back for niggas in New York and how they told me so\nNow I got to knock his boots, he owes me dough\nLayin' up with a ho, then he hit me with the sob story (come on)\nThe famous \"Oh you didn't know I got robbed!\" story (come on)\nTold it's to me he should be grateful to\nFuck that bitch! Look at what she made you do\nNow there's love lost and a double cross\nPointed at that bitch, turned her braids into sauce\nSo you wanna be with him (uh) and talk to me like I'm silly (yeah)\nFive bottle of Mo on the floor, boxes of phillys (uh)\nTen g's in the shoebox under the bed\nAnd for every g I put a fuckin' slug in his head\nAnd from then, the moral of the story if you missed it\nIs the grand is always gonna be there\nJust never go against it\nRepeat 1 (2x)\nYou cats must not know", "image": "https://images.genius.com/feee09d03a61305e2411309887ea4205.220x220x1.jpg", "artist": "DMX",

it's sweet\nUh, uh, uh all you catz don't know\nRepeat 1\nYeah baby, shit's about to jump off and\nLookin' for the bus to bring in my man from up north\nBeen like three years since when got knocked\nSince he got caught\nPunked up like five new blocks, holding down for it\nKept a nigga straight with money in the books\nAnd them bitches is crooks who look out for other crooks\nTook him shopping, money in his pocket is straight\nDropped him off at the wife's crib after we ate\nOur estate was the next move for me\nHad to make that nigga chill for at least two to three months\nCause when it's on, it's on\nHe didn't care\nIt's like slow down baby\nThe money ain't going nowhere\nKeep in touch though and show how much your ass is with it\nThe dope flow is there and in a minute you can get it (come on)\nYou gotta watch a nigga just coming home in a game\nCause on the low we may just be trying to go against the grain\nRepeat 1 (2x)\nI never figured this nigga would pull this shit that he pulled\nWhat is strange is the change that niggas go through\nWhen they're locked down and really can't hack it\nA motherfucker like me handles a bid like a jacket\nStrap it on my back, niggas ain't built like me\nAnd by the end, niggas was like \"Yo, why you killed Mike, D?\"\nWasn't me, but yeah he had it coming to him\nUsed to be my dog, so I let my cousin do him\nSent him out of state with like half a brick down to my spot in VA\nCause the money comes quick\nHalf of that got fucked up before I even got the check in on him (damn)\nBut things happen so I really wasn't wreckin' on him (damn)\nGot him up out of there and sent him down a little further\nAin't heard from him in two months, murder, murder\nAnd from the next flight thinking I might have to steal something\nThis hungry shit will make a nigga wanna kill something (come on)\nRepeat 1 (2x)\nListen, money is missing and it's hectic (what?)\nFound the safe, checked it\nShit looks detected (what?)\nJust what I expected when I got no word from him\nAsked around but ain't nobody heard from him (uh-huh)\nBut money talks and most niggas is snakes\nSo it wasn't long before his man was ready to take\nMe to where he was at, checked my gat\nThrew in a four clip, pumped myself up\nCause I can't go for that bullshit (come on)\nFuckin' with my last load of cash ain't the issue\nIt's just real fucked up when your man tries to diss you\nTakin' back for niggas in New York and how they told me so\nNow I got to knock his boots, he owes me dough\nLayin' up with a ho, then he hit me with the sob story (come on)\nThe famous \"Oh you didn't know I got robbed!\" story (come on)\nTold it's to me he should be grateful to\nFuck that bitch! Look at what she made you do\nNow there's love lost and a double cross\nPointed at that bitch, turned her braids into sauce\nSo you wanna be with him (uh) and talk to me like I'm silly (yeah)\nFive bottle of Mo on the floor, boxes of phillys (uh)\nTen g's in the shoebox under the bed\nAnd for every g I put a fuckin' slug in his head\nAnd from then, the moral of the story if you missed it\nIs the grand is always gonna be there\nJust never go against it\nRepeat 1 (2x)\nYou cats must not know"}}, {"title": "Change is gonna come", "album": null, "year": "2011-02-01", "lyrics": "I was born by the

water\nIf a man can say that he can recognize his own daughter\nAnd if hell is below would you pay the price to go\nThen I can make it to heaven for sure\n\nThis is a cold world (what), cold world\nWe make it this way, but we don't like it this way\nThis is a cold world (what), cold world\nWe make it this way, but we don't like it this way\n\nCats don't know what they say what they talkin'\nSo I just let a nigga say what he feel\nFuckin' with the kid they gon' end up in the coffin\n'Cause I'mma say what I gotta say with the steel\nNiggas hatin' 'cause I got a job\nI know it's they job to be hatin'\nI'm a dog so I don't fuck with cats\n'Cause they gon' have me livin' in a state pen\nIt's about time I reacted\nLook what y'all did to this rap shit\nKnowin' niggas is wrong, come on with the cat shit\nWack shit, get niggas torn down, slapped quick\nBlam, blam, blam, go down that quick\nActin' like the truth was gone\nAnd I'm sayin' gotta deal with the ruthless one\nIt's 2 piece, leave your faggot ass toothless son\nI go hard, dog don't do it, too late, it's done\nHold up, I'mma show you why dog is the illest, kill this\nYou might not catch it, but you'll feel this\nThe realest nigga to ever do it\nThe realest nigga to ever go through it and y'all gon' bring me back to it\nY'all gon' make me lose my mind\nMiddle name is grime, came from crime\nYou thought I'mma change with time, niggas don't know me\nLet your man hold somethin', you ain't got it, nigga show me\n\nThis is a cold world, cold world\nWe make it this way, but we don't like it this way\nThis is a cold world, cold world\nWe make it this way, but we don't like it this way\n\nThe tunnel looks bright up from behind but you gotta keep moving, moving, moving\nBecause if life stops spinning in the right direction whose losin', losin', losin', losin'\nSee in the night, I pray to keep me breathin'\nTo see another day to give them somethin' to believe in\n'Cause I know it won't always be this way\nWhen

lay somebody's else's head where you lay\nDo they find it easy to be hard\nAnd find it even harder to be easy\nYou know sometimes I close my eyes and I wonder\nIf I ever left how much you'd miss me\nOh, somebody told me blood was thicker than water\nIf a man can say that he can recognize his own daughter\nAnd if hell is below would you pay the price to go\nThen I can make it to heaven for sure\n\nThis is a cold world (what), cold world\nWe make it this way, but we don't like it this way\nThis is a cold world (what), cold world\nWe make it this way, but we don't like it this way\n\nCats don't know what they say what they talkin'\nSo I just let a nigga say what he feel\nFuckin' with the kid they gon' end up in the coffin\n'Cause I'mma say what I gotta say with the steel\nNiggas hatin' 'cause I got a job\nI know it's they job to be hatin'\nI'm a dog so I don't fuck with cats\n'Cause they gon' have me livin' in a state pen\nIt's about time I reacted\nLook what y'all did to this rap shit\nKnowin' niggas is wrong, come on with the cat shit\nWack shit, get niggas torn down, slapped quick\nBlam, blam, blam, go down that quick\nActin' like the truth was gone\nAnd I'm sayin' gotta deal with the ruthless one\nIt's 2 piece, leave your faggot ass toothless son\nI go hard, dog don't do it, too late, it's done\nHold up, I'mma show you why dog is the illest, kill this\nYou might not catch it, but you'll feel this\nThe realest nigga to ever do it\nThe realest nigga to ever go through it and y'all gon' bring me back to it\nY'all gon' make me lose my mind\nMiddle name is grime, came from crime\nYou thought I'mma change with time, niggas don't know me\nLet your man hold somethin', you ain't got it, nigga show me\n\nThis is a cold world, cold world\nWe make it this way, but we don't like it this way\nThis is a cold world, cold world\nWe make it this way, but we don't like it this way\n\nThe tunnel looks bright up from behind but you gotta keep moving, moving, moving\nBecause if life stops spinning in the right direction whose losin', losin', losin', losin'\nSee in the night, I pray to keep me breathin'\nTo see another day to give them somethin' to believe in\n'Cause I know it won't always be this way\nWhen you tryin' hard to make a change"}}, {"title": "Come Thru (Move)", "album": "Year of the Dog...

city\nNow you niggas know the flow less ain't controlin' the committee\nNothing' should be movin' unless my crew in it, you fell me\n (Swizz Beatz)\n\nIf there is money involved, I want half\nNiggas is funny to watch, go head laugh\nAin't nothing to smile about\nFor real dog, all niggas is wildin' out\nNiggas who pound you out\nWe found you out in distance\nLeg missin', head missin'\nSomething like 28 days missin'\nAnd you know how the dessert do a nigga\nBrake you down quick, residue a nigga\nCan't stop the flow, Niggas stop and go\nBut whenever I drop, a million out the door\nY'all niggas know, X is not to be fucked with\nY'all run around on some dumb shit with a slump dick\nFucking bitch, you niggas know I don't mind scrapping\nWhen I see you I see you what ever happens, happens\nThis ain't just rappin', niggas talk a good one\nYou know what let that go, see me in the hood son\n (Swizz Beatz)"}}, {"title": "Comin' For Ya", "album": "...And Then There Was X", "year": "1999-12-21",

"album": "Flesh of My Flesh, Blood of My Blood", "year": "1998-12-22", "lyrics": "Believe me, when I say\nBefore light, there was dark\n\nWhere you going, where you going?\nWhere you going, where you going?\nWhere you going?\nIf I don't know where I'm coming from\nWhere would I go?\nIf I don't know where I'm coming from\nWhere would I go?\nIf I don't know where I'm coming from\nWhere would I go?\nIf I don't know where I'm coming from\nWhere would I go?\n\nPlaces that I've have been, things that I have seen\nWhat you call a nightmare, are what I have as dreams\nBad as that may seem, I know is only going to get worse\nLove,or  a slug, which one am I gonna get first?\nMy journey's been a rough one, I'm not sure when it begins\nBut the way it's looking, I kind of know when it's gonna end\nHold me down baby, it's gonna be a rough ride\nNiggas give us plenty of room, cause I guess enough died\nLet me travel, cause my intentions are to travel in peace\nFuck around I lay you down, you hit the gravel and cease\nI could be a beast, or I could be a gentleman\nBut if you ain't my dog, you gonna be like 'Oh, it's him again'\nNiggas will never win, this whole rap game is mine\nHot as you ever been, I was that in eighty nine\nSeek and you shall find, look within and you will know\nWhere you coming from, and where you gotta go\nCome on!\n\nIf I don't know where I'm coming from\nWhere would I go?\nIf I don't know where I'm coming from\nWhere would I go?\n-Got to keep it real with me\nIf I don't know where I'm coming from\nWhere would I go?\n-So the hell with you\nIf I don't know where I'm coming from\nWhere would I go?\n-I think I'm going to the top\nMe and DMX\n\nI will spend mad time in one spot, plotting my next move\nTrying to figure out what is it, that X do what X do\nSome questions go unanswered, that's what I'm afraid of\nSometimes I can't show, but I know what I'm made of\nThey made love, or should I say they made lust\nBound, there didn't have to be love there, but they made us\nI got quite a few sisters, I was the only boy\nBut being with my dog, was my only joy\nLike a kid with a new toy, I forgot about the grime\nEscaped the misery, didn't think about the crime\nLost all track of time, was in another world\nEverybody knew Earl, but there was another Earl\nLighter side of the dark, fighting in the park but wouldn't want to\nWhen they jump me, became a good runner\nOne by one they all went under, so I had the last laugh\nThey all thought it all was a joke, but I had the last laugh\n\nHa ha ha ha ha ha\nCome on!\n\nIf I don't know where I'm coming from\nWhere would I go?\n-If I don't know, I don't know\nIf I don't know where I'm coming from\nWhere would I go?\n-But I know where I'm going\nIf I don't know where I'm coming from\nWhere would I go?\n-But I know where I'm going\nIf I don't know where I'm coming from\nWhere would I go?\n-Do you know, do you know\n\nI feel the ghost from within, coming back to haunt me\nStay love in my peoples, even though they don't want me\nWhen I was bad, I was forgotten, like I was dead and rotten\nShould've been getting love, but instead was plotting\nShit wasn't right, and it was all blamed on me\nDidn't know that I was special till this rap shit came to be\nGave me a way out, showed me it was better to teach\nThan bust niggas with the fo-fo, leave them dead in the streets\nOver beef that was worth less, than the cost of the slugs\nThat I bought to kill them\nAnd that's because I thought I ought to kill them\nLittle did I know, death wasn't right\nDidn't always show every breath was a life\nIt was to be captured in suspended animation\nTo be felt by all, understood by every nation\nWhat's the sense of hating, when I can show love\nWhat's the sense of faking, when I can show blood\n\nNow what's the moral to this story?\n\nCome on!\n\nIf I don't know where I'm coming from\nWhere would I go?\nIf I don't know where I'm coming from\nWhere would I go?\n-If I don't know, I

"Believe me, when I say\nBefore light, there was dark\n\nWhere you going, where you going?\nWhere you going, where you going?\nWhere you going?\nIf I don't know where I'm coming from\nWhere would I go?\nIf I don't know where I'm coming from\nWhere would I go?\nIf I don't know where I'm coming from\nWhere would I go?\nIf I don't know where I'm coming from\nWhere would I go?\n\nPlaces that I've have been, things that I have seen\nWhat you call a nightmare, are what I have as dreams\nBad as that may seem, I know is only going to get worse\nLove,or  a slug, which one am I gonna get first?\nMy journey's been a rough one, I'm not sure when it begins\nBut the way it's looking, I kind of know when it's gonna end\nHold me down baby, it's gonna be a rough ride\nNiggas give us plenty of room, cause I guess enough died\nLet me travel, cause my intentions are to travel in peace\nFuck around I lay you down, you hit the gravel and cease\nI could be a beast, or I could be a gentleman\nBut if you ain't my dog, you gonna be like 'Oh, it's him again'\nNiggas will never win, this whole rap game is mine\nHot as you ever been, I was that in eighty nine\nSeek and you shall find, look within and you will know\nWhere you coming from, and where you gotta go\nCome on!\n\nIf I don't know where I'm coming from\nWhere would I go?\nIf I don't know where I'm coming from\nWhere would I go?\n-Got to keep it real with me\nIf I don't know where I'm coming from\nWhere would I go?\n-So the hell with you\nIf I don't know where I'm coming from\nWhere would I go?\n-I think I'm going to the top\nMe and DMX\n\nI will spend mad time in one spot, plotting my next move\nTrying to figure out what is it, that X do what X do\nSome questions go unanswered, that's what I'm afraid of\nSometimes I can't show, but I know what I'm made of\nThey made love, or should I say they made lust\nBound, there didn't have to be love there, but they made us\nI got quite a few sisters, I was the only boy\nBut being with my dog, was my only joy\nLike a kid with a new toy, I forgot about the grime\nEscaped the misery, didn't think about the crime\nLost all track of time, was in another world\nEverybody knew Earl, but there was another Earl\nLighter side of the dark, fighting in the park but wouldn't want to\nWhen they jump me, became a good runner\nOne by one they all went under, so I had the last laugh\nThey all thought it all was a joke, but I had the last laugh\n\nHa ha ha ha ha ha\nCome on!\n\nIf I don't know where I'm coming from\nWhere would I go?\n-If I don't know, I don't know\nIf I don't know where I'm coming from\nWhere would I go?\n-But I know where I'm going\nIf I don't know where I'm coming from\nWhere would I go?\n-But I know where I'm going\nIf I don't know where I'm coming from\nWhere would I go?\n-Do you know, do you know\n\nI feel the ghost from within, coming back to haunt me\nStay love in my peoples, even though they don't want me\nWhen I was bad, I was forgotten, like I was dead and rotten\nShould've been getting love, but instead was plotting\nShit wasn't right, and it was all blamed on me\nDidn't know that I was special till this rap shit came to be\nGave me a way out, showed me it was better to teach\nThan bust niggas with the fo-fo, leave them dead in the streets\nOver beef that was worth less, than the cost of the slugs\nThat I bought to kill them\nAnd that's because I thought I ought to kill them\nLittle did I know, death wasn't right\nDidn't always show every breath was a life\nIt was to be captured in suspended animation\nTo be felt by all, understood by every nation\nWhat's the sense of hating, when I can show love\nWhat's the sense of faking, when I can show blood\n\nNow what's the moral to this story?\n\nCome on!\n\nIf I don't know where I'm coming from\nWhere would I go?\nIf I don't know where I'm coming from\nWhere would I go?\n-If I don't know, I don't know\nIf I don't know where I'm coming from\nWhere would I go?\n-But I know where I'm coming from\nIf I don't know where I'm coming from\nWhere would I go?\n-Do you know where you're coming from?\nYonkers is where we grew\nTrials we got through\nOn top is where we staying\nTill the

happen\nYa know\nIts crazy dog\nIts off the hook\nBut you know\nReal niggas survive\nNo regardless\nCause I'm heartless\n\nWho is this I see, coming through, its like 3 in the a.m\nI'ma rob this nigga, and when I'm done, I'ma slay him\nFor being stupid like, comin' through after 1 or 2\nAnd havin' a gun that he couldn't get to, yeah, that one'll do\nFoolish niggas learn the hard way, then I teach 'em\nBe in the wrong place at the wrong time, then I leach 'em\nLike Jigga said, niggas test you when your gun goes warm\nSo I keep 'em scattering like roaches, when the light turns off\nFrom night to dawn, right from wrong holds no weight\n3-57 slugs with a snub nose, dray eight\nSettin' all you bitches straight (what) squashing all beefs\nTo the point where the police be blockin' all streets\nGot me trapped up in the building, but you know how that go\nI stay fucking with the hood rats and I run up in the rab hole\nRun through the hallway, see police, face to face\nAnd being I'm telling you this story, means I caught another case\n\nIts either you or me\nAnd more than likely, its gonna be you, than me\nAiight? Feel me, O\n\nDay 2 of the saga, this fucking drama continues\nWaking up like every 2 hours, looking out my window\nPlus I keep the 4-4 pointed at the door just in case\nWhen they bust in, I bust them and I'm gunning for the face\n\"What a waste of potential\" is what my teachers used to tell me\n\"You can always get a job\" and cheap shit they tried to sell me\nGot me no where but broke and fucked up in the game\nBut now I got a name, and niggas know my name\nKnock of the door \"Police!

heartless\n\nWho is this I see, coming through, its like 3 in the a.m\nI'ma rob this nigga, and when I'm done, I'ma slay him\nFor being stupid like, comin' through after 1 or 2\nAnd havin' a gun that he couldn't get to, yeah, that one'll do\nFoolish niggas learn the hard way, then I teach 'em\nBe in the wrong place at the wrong time, then I leach 'em\nLike Jigga said, niggas test you when your gun goes warm\nSo I keep 'em scattering like roaches, when the light turns off\nFrom night to dawn, right from wrong holds no weight\n3-57 slugs with a snub nose, dray eight\nSettin' all you bitches straight (what) squashing all beefs\nTo the point where the police be blockin' all streets\nGot me trapped up in the building, but you know how that go\nI stay fucking with the hood rats and I run up in the rab hole\nRun through the hallway, see police, face to face\nAnd being I'm telling you this story, means I caught another case\n\nIts either you or me\nAnd more than likely, its gonna be you, than me\nAiight? Feel me, O\n\nDay 2 of the saga, this fucking drama continues\nWaking up like every 2 hours, looking out my window\nPlus I keep the 4-4 pointed at the door just in case\nWhen they bust in, I bust them and I'm gunning for the face\n\"What a waste of potential\" is what my teachers used to tell me\n\"You can always get a job\" and cheap shit they tried to sell me\nGot me no where but broke and fucked up in the game\nBut now I got a name, and niggas know my name\nKnock of the door \"Police! We're looking for a man\nKilled a couple of cops last night and the reward is ten grand\"\nI play like a bitch \"Its just me here, and I'm not dressed\nAnd that guy sounds kind of dangerous, I hope you make an arrest\"\nThat was a close one, now I know I gotta get outta the city\nCause I know I'm hotter than lava, I'm holla the mouth\nGot my dog on the horn, he like \"Fuck, you done did?!\nThey done ran up in my crib, nigga, patting down my kid!\"\n(dial tone)\n\nPut the harness on the dog, load up the weapons\nMurder's on my mind, no half steppin'\nMotherfuckers want war, you can get it\nCause I'm tired of running, remember me as the nigga that died gunning\nKamakaze mission, C-4 strapped to the chest\nRun up in that joint, raw dog; fuck the vest\nThey can keep theirs, cause it won't be the slugs that'll kill 'em\nIt'll be the roar of the C-4 as I'm bringing down the building\nWhen I go, taking a bunch of the motherfuckas with me\nI ain't sitting around waiting for them faggot niggas to come and get me\nI bring it to 'em, service with a smile; what nigga?\nDidn't know a dog with rabies was up in the cut, nigga?\nNow that you finally finding out what this shit means\nI'm at the precinct, 116th\nRun up in there, open up my jacket \"You motherfuckas looking for me?\"\n\"Well here I am!

I'm about to make it rappin'\nToday I met this cat, he said his name was Damien\nHe thinks that we're a lot alike and wants to be my friend\n(You mean like Chuckie?)

I coulda swore it was over a ho?\nNah, nah, that ain't my style \u2014 nigga, you stay frontin'\nBut you're still my man, and I ain't gonna say nothin'\nGot some weed? Go 'head, smoke it! Go 'head, drink it!\nGo 'head and fuck shorty! You know I can keep a secret (aight)\nI'm about to have you drivin', probably a Benz\nBut we gotta stay friends: blood out, blood in\nSounds good to me, fuck it, what I got to lose?\nHmm, nothin' I can think of, any nigga would choose\nGot me pushin' the whips, takin' trips across seas\nPockets stay laced, nigga, I floss G's\nFor that nigga I would bleed, give him my right hand\nNow that I think about it\u2026 yo, that's my man!\n\nThe snake, the rat, the cat, the dog\nHow you gonna see him if you livin' in the fog?\nThe snake, the rat, the cat, the dog\nHow you gonna see him if you livin' in the fog?\n\nYou like how everything is goin'? You like what I gave ya?\nYou know if you was goin' down I'd be the one to save ya\nBut yo, I need a favor, these cats across town hate me\nPlus their behavior hasn't been too good lately\nWhat?

it's dog love)\n\nI run with shorty, pass off the gun to shorty\nDo whatever gots to be done with shorty, straight like that\nWhen I hit her like \"I'll be right back\"\nYo, I'll be right back, ain't no bullshittin, I'll be right back\nShe got a nigga catchin feelings, I'm a street nigga hard body\nBut, she got me catchin feelings\nMan, those eyes, those lips\nBe like damn, those thighs, those hips\nShe like \"blam\", make a nigga have to touch somethin (For real)\nNot necessarily fuck somethin, as long as I touch somethin (For real)\nA nigga blood boil when I see another nigga holla (WHAT)\nDon't make me have to pop a nigga in his fuckin collar\n\n\nAiyyo, shit is goin to smooth (Uh)\nSince Stella got a new groove (Yeah) it's like we got somethin to prove\nWe gon' make it, rain or shine\nMy heart is yours and yours is mine\nLike Eve said, \"Love Is Blind\" (Come on), right about now\nI can't see shit cause you always on my mind\nBeen like that, since I met her, had to have her so I went to get her\nBut I'm a dog so I didn't sweat her\nAnd it wasn't bout the cheddar, I don't trick\nI got two things for bitches, couple of jokes and some dick\nYeah the kid talk slick but that's not what I'm about\nWe got dog love and me and shorty ridin it out, we out\n\n\nAll I want is you in my life\nAll I got is you in my life\nAll I need is you in my life\nSo I know I'm gonna be all right\n(Repeat)", "image": "https://images.genius.com/3843bd8bdb5f681116b197d8a9226af4.300x300x1.jpg", "artist": "DMX", "raw": {"annotation_count": 2, "api_path": "/songs/17525", "description":

thought this whole rap shit was yours?\nStop being greedy, when was the last time you gave to the needy\nBelieve me, I run through niggas like hallways with the cops behind\nGive it to a nigga all day cause I pops the nine\nMan listen, if you don't wanna see your man missin, man listen\nI get dough like a nigga in a up north flick\nAnd still roll like a nigga on some up north shit\nThe way dog flip out, cats'll never understand\nNiggas be like \"X I thought I was your man!\"\nNot!\n\nThis is dedicated to, this is dedicated to\nThe streets, this is dedicated to\n\nMy dogs is dogs that love to brawl\nBring as many as you got cause we gon fuck 'em all\nDicksucked in the hall\nThe same shorty thats puttin any work on her knees\nI'm duckin her call\nA dog is a dog is a dog for life, dog been a dog, dog in your wife\nI got kids this age\nBut let 'em keep talkin slick and I'm gon put somethin hot up in his ribcage\n\nWhen the dog is out, bitch ass niggas get bit or fucked\nOne or the two, and

niggas is crying, \"But I don't want anyone to blast\"\nSo from the roof I pick em off like a scab\nAnd watch the slug bust a thug like a watermelon\nHe shoulda thought about that before caught a terror\nAnd now another kid grows up without a daddy or a mommy\nCause at the funeral I hit up the caddy\nIt's the army for real niggas with nothing to lose\nCause when it's time to go you don't get to choose\nI make the muthafuckin rules and I enforce it\nShorty's people was loose hand so he lost it\nI took the joints and tossed them, in the river\nAt the same spot that I dumped\nThis kid that didn't wanna give a nigga the combo, to the safe in the crib\nLook, money, that's why I did what I did\n{2 niggas Talking.....}\n\nMad stressed and I'm about to have a breakdown\nIt's time for pops who got the store on the corner to have get a shakedown\nHe hasn't paid for protection in like two months\nSo I figured I'd leave him with like two fronts\nI break up shit to let him know that I'm real\nReminder, I know where you live so don't squeal\nTold him, next time I come, have some paper for me\nDon't fuck around and turn into another caper for me\nCause though he's cool all that cool shit stops\nAnd I be in the crowd talking bout, \"Yo who killed pops?\"\nIt's a shame, he was caught up in the game and couldn't play it\nSo I smoked him, I asked him \"who's the man\" and made him say it\nThree times, and that's how many times I hit him\nA nigga was acting like he didn't have to pay so I did him\nYo I think this shit is going to my head (for real)\nBut let that be a lesson, don't pay dues and you dead\n{2 niggas Talking.....}\n\nA little birdie told me that the feds were on to me\nAnd they wanted to do something real wrong to me\nSo I broke out, Blazed the L for a while\nChecked my sources and found my name was on file\nUnder gun for hire and extortion, but yo I never use\nThe same joint twice as a precaution and I heard this kid tried to set me up\nHe knew I knew so he tried to wet me up\nSee he was under investigation for drugs\nThey set up all types of phone taps and bugs\nThen when they bagged him, money went out, reprisent (he was my friend)\nSaid they'd let him go, all he had to do was snitch\nAnd I know now he wish they would have kept him\nCause it was sweet how I crept him, wet him up then left him\nAnd that's for muh'fuckas that don't know\nGo against the grain and you feel the pain\nAight yo?", "image": "https://images.genius.com/9f7195fb16451aa7abd2259bdb6bb54b.500x500x1.jpg", "artist": "DMX", "raw": {"annotation_count": 4,

shit\nBroad daylight, niggas is crying, \"But I don't want anyone to blast\"\nSo from the roof I pick em off like a scab\nAnd watch the slug bust a thug like a watermelon\nHe shoulda thought about that before caught a terror\nAnd now another kid grows up without a daddy or a mommy\nCause at the funeral I hit up the caddy\nIt's the army for real niggas with nothing to lose\nCause when it's time to go you don't get to choose\nI make the muthafuckin rules and I enforce it\nShorty's people was loose hand so he lost it\nI took the joints and tossed them, in the river\nAt the same spot that I dumped\nThis kid that didn't wanna give a nigga the combo, to the safe in the crib\nLook, money, that's why I did what I did\n{2 niggas Talking.....}\n\nMad stressed and I'm about to have a breakdown\nIt's time for pops who got the store on the corner to have get a shakedown\nHe hasn't paid for protection in like two months\nSo I figured I'd leave him with like two fronts\nI break up shit to let him know that I'm real\nReminder, I know where you live so don't squeal\nTold him, next time I come, have some paper for me\nDon't fuck around and turn into another caper for me\nCause though he's cool all that cool shit stops\nAnd I be in the crowd talking bout, \"Yo who killed pops?\"\nIt's a shame, he was caught up in the game and couldn't play it\nSo I smoked him, I asked him \"who's the man\" and made him say it\nThree times, and that's how many times I hit him\nA nigga was acting like he didn't have to pay so I did him\nYo I think this shit is going to my head (for real)\nBut let that be a lesson, don't pay dues and you dead\n{2 niggas Talking.....}\n\nA little birdie told me that the feds were on to me\nAnd they wanted to do something real wrong to me\nSo I broke out, Blazed the L for a while\nChecked my sources and found my name was on file\nUnder gun for hire and extortion, but yo I never use\nThe same joint twice as a precaution and I heard this kid tried to set me up\nHe knew I knew so he tried to wet me up\nSee he was under investigation for drugs\nThey set up all types of phone taps and bugs\nThen when they bagged him, money went out, reprisent (he was my friend)\nSaid they'd let him go, all he had to do was snitch\nAnd I know now he wish they would have kept him\nCause it was sweet how I crept him, wet him up then left him\nAnd that's for muh'fuckas that don't know\nGo against the grain and you feel the pain\nAight yo?"}}, {"title": "Don't You Ever", "album": "...And Then There Was X", "year": "1999-12-21", "lyrics": "Don't

whole party\nIt ain't about tryin' to follow or tryin' to be like\nBut if we all see it through the eyes of the lord, we can see a light (c'mon)\nJust let me get a hold of the mic, I'll teach you a little something\nNow the good things that go wrong because of a little frontin'\nExpress yourselves, be who you are, umm umm, you're a shining star\nYou don't even know what you got inside\nHow the

walk the streets, learn what you need to learn\nBetter have a cause but because you'll get burned\nYou got 15 years without ever coming out\nAnd beat your fist at the world and what they talkin' about\nThen get locked up every two years\nFor two years keep it real, hold back all tears, face your fears\nBecome a man before your time, rap but live out your rhymes\nLet 'em know what's on your mind, then you'll get your shine\nIn time, everything you hear will come true\nBut you won't be doin' me, you'll be doin' you\n\nDo you - 'cause what it boils down to it's true\nDo you - 'cause you are held accountable for you\nDo you - is that really what you want me to see\nDo you - 'cause I'mma do me, truley, woo-hee", "image":

man, ain't controlling shit\nTalk about holding bricks, but ain't holding dick\nNiggas talk real slick, but that's about it\nSoon as I see 'em headed my way, I cut them off quick\nMust you beat me in my head everytime I come through?\nIt's shit like, everybody tells me I sound just like you\nBut you got me, got me? and you can't live without me\nIf I wasn't dmx, you wouldn't give a f**k about me\nAin't about \"dog I wanna be just like you\"\nHow about you wanting to be just like you?\nYou can do what I do, just in your own way\nShit, I get niggas that ride big every f**kin' day (i-ight? )\nIf you got talent, talent is yours, it can't be mine\nAnd it take you where it's gon' take you, it'll be fine\nLet me hit 'em with the rewind\nDo you and I'll do me\nTo me you'll see how real you'll be\n\nDo you - 'cause what it boils down to it's true\nDo you - 'cause you are held accountable for you\nDo you - is that really what you want me to see\nDo you - 'cause I'mma do me, truley,

yo dog, I got lyrics\nHey yo dog, I got beats (word)\nDamn, is this the type of shit I gots to put up with in the streets?\nUsed to be able to walk, not have to talk to nobody\nEverywhere I go it's like I bring the whole party\nIt ain't about tryin' to follow or tryin' to be like\nBut if we all see it through the eyes of the lord, we can see a light (c'mon)\nJust let me get a hold of the mic, I'll teach you a little something\nNow the good things that go wrong because of a little frontin'\nExpress yourselves, be who you are, umm umm, you're a shining star\nYou don't even know what you got inside\nHow the fuck you gon' find out, you keep wanting to ride\nHey yo, I ain't gon' let it slide no more\nYou're best to good or what you know\nCan't do you, then what you flow for\nYou ain't gon' get there tryin' to be me, dog\nLook through your eyes, see what you see\n\nDo you - 'cause what it boils down to it's true\nDo you - 'cause you are held accountable for you\nDo you - is that really what you want me to see\nDo you - 'cause I'mma do me, truley, woo hee\n\nLike fuck it, you wanna be me? here's what you do\nGrow up neglected by both parents and still pull through\nYou gots to come up fucked up, get treated like shit\nThen have your mother's new boyfriend smack you like a bitch turn into a killer\nDon't carry shottie\n'cause the way it's goin' down right now, you gon' kill somebody\nGet a dog, walk the streets, learn what you need to learn\nBetter have a cause but because you'll get burned\nYou got 15 years without ever coming out\nAnd beat your fist at the world and what they talkin' about\nThen get locked up every two years\nFor two years keep it real, hold back all tears, face your fears\nBecome a man before your time, rap but live out your rhymes\nLet 'em know what's on your mind, then you'll get your shine\nIn time, everything you hear will come true\nBut you won't be doin' me, you'll be doin' you\n\nDo you - 'cause what it boils down to it's true\nDo you

Styles\nBitch, I get you shot in the head or shot in the neck\nIf I ain't gettin proper respect\nI don't care if you rap, I still spit in your grill\nI don't give a fuck, never have, never will\nIf it ain't on your hip, then you're lookin to die\nI ain't tryin to be the nigga that's gonna look at the sky\nAsk God why I'm broke, bitch, I'm cooking the pie\nWe all gon' die, sooner or later, matter of time\nMy niggas sell crack, with a package of dimes\nHundred or more, in front of the store, waitin to bubble\nBrand new nine, and an eight in a bubble\nI put sixteen above ya neck, I love my set\nNiggas think they a thug, then thug to death (uh-huh)\nCause the P gonna squeeze 'til no slugs is left (what)\nYou know I'm good with a hundred of 'dro, gun and an O\nYou think your shit butter? Hop in front of this toast\n\nYo, aiyyo, aiyyo\nI say what I want, fuck what y'all think is cool\nAnd I hate cops, cause most y'all was dicks in school\nNo pussy gettin niggas tryin to cuff the God\nPlay Sheik out in the yard, but that shit too hard\nMy dough too long, nowadays, my flow too strong\nWhat y'all make in a year, I kick that for a song\nCheck my car, I don't care, I don't play fair\nKeep some shit in the stash box, then get me the chair\nAnd it don't buck shot and the blast is hard to hear\nI'm a true thug nigga, bring it straight to your crew\nSmall yell when I rap, I'm basically talkin to you\nYou see the pain in my eye? Nigga, the flame in my eye?\nI'm tryin to leave my kids some real fuckin change when I die\nFrom rappin or tellin some cat to reach for the sky\nI'm that hunt down nigga, with the four pound nigga\nBounty hunt your whole crew til my bullets go through, WHAT?\n\nYo, yo, yo, yo\nAll I need is a big gun and a Coupe that's crazy quick\nA nice house with five rooms, maybe six\nA town where money is coming, eighty bricks\nBreak 'em down to all twenties, is a crazy flip\nBet you never even felt the heat\nTil I put the M1 next to your waves and melt the grease\nStreets help niggas; niggas don't help the streets\nY'all use beats for help; we help the beats\nWho want it with me? Who want it with Sheek? Who want it with P?\nIf I say so myself, it's a wonderful three\nBe in the hood with all your jewels in the glovebox\nSame niggas that-a rob you love L.O.X. (uh)\nAll types of burners, even snub Glocks (uh)\nNice size tecs you could carry in your sweats (uh)\nFind your man dead in the trunk of a car (uh)\nIt's Jada {*mwwaa*} responsible for breakin your heart (uh)\nUh\n\nCreep through the streets\nFor some of y'all rappers, that's mighty hard\nMe the Security? Protectin my body? I let my shotty guard\nPut chill pills in brains, bullets like Tylenol\nMake niggas drowsy from the blood loss, got em noddin off\nAnd take casket naps, fuck that\nYou shoulda never let this bastard rap\nAll I know is cold winter, hot slugs through your snorkel\nNo parents, tale from my horror's no morals\nRaised in the wrong era, with no guidance\nSo you dyin? It's no problem, no lyin\nDrag's fire; so ya hamburger beef? I french-fry 'em\nDrag done ate your food\nLike I know to raise your dukes so guard your chin up\nDrag barrels, but shit, I spit-bubble your skin up\nDrag scorch niggas for dinner but season 'em well\nI don't brag I let the streets tell\nPo'-po' now you see he fell\n {*overlapping last line*}\nUh, uh, now you motherfuckers\nKnow what my name means when you hear it in the streets (uh)\nY'all bitches fear it cause you weak\nYou wanna hear it? I make it speak (WHAT?)\nYou ain't ever bust a gun, but there's a lot of greasy talkin (uh-huh)\nWhat the science behind that son? (I don't know)\nA lot of easy walkin\nI bust shit down (uh) got down (uh) kick down (uh) shot down (uh)\nAin't tryin to talk about what I got now, but I got now (WHAT?)\nI ain't never sold a brick, I done stuck niggas up (c'mon)\nAnd for talkin too much shit? I done fucked niggas up (uh)\nIt can get \"Dark\" for real, and I think you already know that (uh-huh)\nWell think about it with the brick in your hand before you throw that\nNow don't act, cause actin might get you rollin\nWith what you ain't ready to handle (UHH)\nAll that's left of your memory, is a candle (WOO!)\nIt happens quick fast nigga, to bitch ass niggas\nTalkin reckless behind your back, them kiss ass niggas (uh)\nFrom the rap shit to the street shit, I keep shit tight\nLet them cats spit that weak shit (What!)\nI'm DOG FOR LIFE!

why I pat you on your head, smile\nLook in your eyes and thank the lord for my child\nMeanwhile, something I gotta show you an I hope you can take it\nGonna leave you in the desert, an I hope that you make it\nGotta put you on your ass to see what it does to you\nWhen you stand up an see that I'm just showin' love to you\nOther niggas would put a slug through you, over your ends\nCaps I fucked with are real, but hey\nThose are your friends\nIts just what you got coming sometimes you don't know\nWhat you asking for, did you ask for more?\nShould the casket door swing here, it is done\nAn thought you was a killer, you swore you'd never run\nNigga died with his gun still up in the holster\nIt is comin' in the air? Yeah its getting' closer\nI see life through many shades of grays and blacks\nI could take that an hit 'em with the blazin' tracks\nWhen I make that you fake cats have violent dreams\nTakes another dog to be able to hear my silent screams\nThe devil got a hold on me an he won't let go\nI can feel the lord pullin' but he movin' dead slow\nLet 'em know that amidst all this confusion\nSome of us may do the winnin'\nBut we all do the losin' its just who does the choosin'\nEasy goin up or down what have you been provin'?\nJus that you were fuckin' ground\nBitch seen the bullshit, but never spoke on it\nAn I know that deep down you really don't want it\nI woulda traded the chance of bein' the child with a father\nMovin' talent and bein' able to survive when its harder\nMy balance on the high beams of life, keep my dreams in strife\nThat's why I hit these motherfuckin' streets at night\nCome on!\nThere's a lotta shit that I let slide, cuz its outta my hands\nLotta niggas I let ride, but its not in my plans\nAn a lot of my mans is not seein' through the fog\nFamilies by the truckload, fleein' them to the morgue\nFull moon, arooooo, the howlin', grrrrrrr\nAn growlin', shhhhhh, an prowlin'\nDon't know love, can't show love\nThat means you gonna need more love\nThan on old thug, but hold up, roll up\nTalkin' out the side of your mouth is\nWhat's gonna is what's gonna let niggas know\nWhy you bad in your house, an they lie up to your spouse\nTold her it was suicide, but you an I\nBoth knew the truth, for we'd never die\nListen nigga, if you scared, get a dog, but be prepared, for the mob\nCuz you dead up in the fog, an that's your head by the log\nI can smell it in the air, I can tell when its there\nThis is hell an we both here\nCan you feel it?

(Y'KNOW?)\n..\nARF!\nUhh..\nTake it for what it's worth, my birth was a blessing\nSent to live and die, on earth as a lesson\nWe each have a star, all we have to do is find it\nOnce you do, everyone who sees it will be blinded (WHAT?)\nThey'll tell you that you're bright, and say you have a future\nWhen you turn your back, same cats'll try to shoot ya\nNiggas ain't shit, I can live on both sides of the fence\nForget what you do, when you talk, see what you really meant (aight?)\nThat's what I thought, them niggas was bluffin (uh)\nThey talk all day but say, nothin (uh)\nIt gets so dark (what?) the pain's so intense\nSince this first rain it's like it's rained ever since (WHAT?)\nNever got paid for a rhyme but I flow (whoo)\nNever got a plate on time but I grow (whoo)\nLive your life, STAY on the line but I go (UHH)\nWent from doin crime to bein kind cause I know\nChorus: DMX (repeat 2X)\nI'm gon' live forever, I'm never gon' die\nOnly thing I fear is that I'm never gon' fly\nCarry my weight but I'm never gon' cry\nShit I tell y'all niggas straight cause I'm never gon' lie\n\nWhat is about who I am that makes me unforgettable (HMM)\nWhat it is about what I've done that makes it so incredible (uhh)\n\"More money, more problems\" -- well the fame was worse (uh-huh)\nI reached out for love and what came back was thirst (WHAT?)\nBlessed with the curse (uh) niggas don't hear me\nNiggas don't hear me, Y'ALL NIGGAZ, don't hear me (uh)\nWhat'd I just say? \"Niggas don't hear you!\" See that?\nYou gots to FEEL ME to catch what I'm sayin, BELIEVE THAT (UHH!)\nBut leave that, alone (WHAT?)\nWe gon' make a nigga wanna be at, your home (WHAT?)\nOh you kinda quiet with the heat at, your dome (UHH!)\nIf the dog got he's gonna bring back a bone\nCause we got the chrome (C'MON!)\nThis is what I live for, or die for\nI'm the nigga with the high score, you try for\nWhat you niggas wanna lie for? It changes nothin\nI'm true for cats, yet some strangers bluffin\nChorus\n\nNow if I take what he gave me and I, use it right (uh-huh)\nIn other words if I listen and, use the light (uh-huh)\nThen what I say will remain here, after I'm gone\nStill here, on the strength of a song, I live on (HMM)\nNo second-guessin on what I stood for, I was good for\nStoppin niggas from killin each other in the hood war (UHH)\nComin through showin love, throwin up (UHH)\nThem cats not throwin love, you know whassup (WHAT?)\nDark Man baby, that's my name\nAnd I gots to be the realest nigga (UHH) up in this game\nCause ain't no shame, they don't make em like, this no more\nReal to the core, big heart but built for war\nI stand for what I believe in\nEven if what I believe in stops me from

(Y'KNOW?)\n..\nARF!\nUhh..\nTake it for what it's worth, my birth was a blessing\nSent to live and die, on earth as a lesson\nWe each have a star, all we have to do is find it\nOnce you do, everyone who sees it will be blinded (WHAT?)\nThey'll tell you that you're bright, and say you have a future\nWhen you turn your back, same cats'll try to shoot ya\nNiggas ain't shit, I can live on both sides of the fence\nForget what you do, when you talk, see what you really meant (aight?)\nThat's what I thought, them niggas was bluffin (uh)\nThey talk all day but say, nothin (uh)\nIt gets so dark (what?) the pain's so intense\nSince this first rain it's like it's rained ever since (WHAT?)\nNever got paid for a rhyme but I flow (whoo)\nNever got a plate on time but I grow (whoo)\nLive your life, STAY on the line but I go (UHH)\nWent from doin crime to bein kind cause I know\nChorus: DMX (repeat 2X)\nI'm gon' live forever, I'm never gon' die\nOnly thing I fear is that I'm never gon' fly\nCarry my weight but I'm never gon' cry\nShit I tell y'all niggas straight cause I'm never gon' lie\n\nWhat is about who I am that makes me unforgettable (HMM)\nWhat it is about what I've done that makes it so incredible (uhh)\n\"More money, more problems\" -- well the fame was worse (uh-huh)\nI reached out for love and what came back was thirst (WHAT?)\nBlessed with the curse (uh) niggas don't hear me\nNiggas don't hear me, Y'ALL NIGGAZ, don't hear me (uh)\nWhat'd I just say? \"Niggas don't hear you!\" See that?\nYou gots to FEEL ME to catch what I'm sayin, BELIEVE THAT (UHH!)\nBut leave that, alone (WHAT?)\nWe gon' make a nigga wanna be at, your home (WHAT?)\nOh you kinda quiet with the heat at, your dome (UHH!)\nIf the dog got he's gonna bring back a bone\nCause we got the chrome (C'MON!)\nThis is what I live for, or die for\nI'm the nigga with the high score, you try for\nWhat you niggas wanna lie for? It changes nothin\nI'm true for cats, yet some strangers bluffin\nChorus\n\nNow if I take what he gave me and I, use it right (uh-huh)\nIn other words if I listen and, use the light (uh-huh)\nThen what I say will remain here, after I'm gone\nStill here, on the strength of a song, I live on (HMM)\nNo second-guessin on what I stood for, I was good for\nStoppin niggas from killin each other in the hood war (UHH)\nComin through showin love, throwin up (UHH)\nThem cats not throwin love, you know whassup (WHAT?)\nDark Man baby, that's my name\nAnd I gots to be the realest nigga (UHH) up in this game\nCause ain't no shame, they don't make em like, this no more\nReal to the core, big heart but built for war\nI stand for what I believe in\nEven if what I believe in stops me from breathin\nRelatives grievin, but I ain't went nowhere\nListen to the song (C'MON) I'm right there\nChorus"}}, {"title": "Fire", "album": "Undisputed", "year": "2012-09-11", "lyrics": "Uh, uh, uh, uh, grrrrr\nGrrrrrr, WHAT!\nUh, uh, uh, uh, uh\n\nI love music cause it's somethin special\nI just have the words and when I'm done, I bet you\nIt'll make you easier to cope with the pressure\nIn dark, cause you think the light won't let ya\nRight now all I see is shapes and sounds\nYou snake you clown that's why I shake you down\nGot somethin I want, I'ma take it now\nIt is what it is, you cryin like \"How I'ma make it now?\"\nGet the FUCK off your knees, I don't swing like that!\nCause when I let it go I let it go, I throw that thing right back\nMan, I can smell pussy from a mile away\nNigga yo' style is shade so, put the smile away\nNiggas actin like I'm the only one with problems\nYou know somethin I don't?

Last thing he heard was \"Boom\"!\nCan I get some room or do I gots to, make me a path?\nBreak you in half, fake niggas make me laugh\nY'all niggas is funny, still talking 'bout money\nAnd ain't got none, get the shotgun 'cause you hungry\nIt's about to get ugly when the, lights is out\nOne, two, three, ho that's three strikes you out\nHis knife was out, I think they found it still in his hand\nHe in a bag and I'm over here, killing his man!\n\nFlesh of my flesh, blood of my blood\nAll my niggas get down like what\nFlesh of my flesh, blood of my blood\nAll my niggas get down like what\n\nI no longer see the shadows that once kept me strong\nAnd I'm starting to get that same feeling that kept me wrong\nCan't afford to trust niggas cause niggas lust figures\nPlus niggas is scared to bust niggas, rush niggas\nDueling with the heat, and ain't killing nothing but time\nFucking with the street, but you ain't feeling nothing but mine\nTired of hearing niggas rhyme that don't say shit\nFuck is on them niggas minds, why don't they quit?\nSucking my dick looking for something new\nLet your man hold something with your hold something crew\nYou know how niggas do, we don't forget shit\nIf you was there when it's thin, then you there when it's thick\nNo hitchhikers, fuck that, the Ryde was Ruff\nAnd every nigga that was wit us, that died was Ruff\nA lot of niggas that are wit us, ain't cried enough\nSo now when niggas come and get us, we fires em up\n\nFlesh of my flesh, blood of my blood\nAll my niggas get down like what\nFlesh of my flesh, blood of my blood\nAll my niggas get down like what\n\nMotherfuckers, thought that the, X would stop\nBut I got niggas like, \"Yo, who's the next to drop?\"\nFrom his camp, get the stamp, grand champ, it's official\nThink when you die how many's gon' miss you\nLean over in your casket and kiss you\nSend you on your way with a blessing\nAnd pray that another learned a lesson\nSmith and Wesson ended money's life, now money's wife's a widow\n(Gave it to him full blast?) Nah dog, just a little\nBeside rap I don't talk but make plenty of moves\nI'll murder, ten of you fools before you're ready to choose\nYou either, win or you lose, and I, love to win\nEven if it means I gotta shed blood again\nKeep the bank account doubling, but don't hate me\nReally thought that what you said would either, make me or break me?\nKnowin it don't take me long to write\nMatter of fact, I think I'll drop another, song tonight\n\nFlesh of my flesh, blood of my blood\nAll my niggas get down like what\nFlesh of my flesh, blood of my blood\nAll my niggas get down like what"}}, {"title": "For My Dogs", "album": "It's Dark and Hell is Hot", "year": "1998-05-19", "lyrics": "My niggas...\n\nThis is for my dog, this is for my dog\nThis is for my dog, this is for my dog\nThis is for my dog, this is for my dog\nThis is for my dog... my niggas\n\nMy dogs the beginning of this bloodline of mine\nThat spark this in a nigga's heart and cause him to shine\nBefore the rhyme lessons that I keep in my mind, I owe you\nAnd I give my right hand to show you\nWhether its fist or guns whatever it go to\nIts me they go through if ever they want to\nI'd light the flame, dead game and trying to scratch\nK-A-S I know where my dogs is at\n\nAnd I'm gonna be the one behind just to keep you on your toes\nI be your extra eyes and hold you down around your foes\nI be your extra gun, if you need me let me know\nFor my dogs I be the first to cock it back and let it go\nThey do it for the dough me I do it for the love\nYou're my nigga to the death so I treat you like my blood\nIf push comes to shove and they try to send you back to the streets\nI give my last to put you back on your feet, feel me\n\nThis is for my dog, this is for my dog\nThis is for my dog, this is for my dog\nThis is for my dog, this is for my dog\nThis is for my dog... my niggas\n\nYou my dog nigga I die for\nShit bust a five for see the judge and lie for\nYou the type of nigga I throw weight up on the block for\nJust go ahead and lock jaws, and your half?

that\nI bark like that, jet black, but I spark like that\nWhere are they at, when I get thirsty, shit\nAin't a nigga strong enough to stand the worst it gets\nBits, and pieces are all that's that left\nNiggas so scared to death, they hold they motherfucking breath\nTil I pass, cause they asked/ass, and I smelled 'em\nThe s-p-e-l-l-e-d t-h-e-m, I spelled em\nTo make me have to swell one, eye up, lump up one head\nCatch a body with the shotty, pump up one dead\nRed alert, niggas is about to get hurt, do work\nTo skirts, like a jag on the merk, arf\nNight time is the right time for creeping\nVandalize your crib, rape your wife while she's sleeping\nI been off the deep end, since I was semen\nThat's why now, I'm such a motherfucking demon!\nScreaming, my bloody head off, shit on my mind I gotsta get off\nCan't even hold a joint, lest I let off\nA couple of rounds, from the big three pound, seven\nThat's about eleven hundred as of

faggot\nFat loops leather jackets, I bag it, along with\nThe jewels smacking tools out the hands of fools\nOn the strength that they don't know what they holding\nNiggas caught me tail end cause the weight that I be sewing\nShit up cause I get up, off my ass and skate\nMaking more moves than u-haul, from state to state\nI speak the great, and if a nigga tells you different\nYou turn around you ask the nigga, \"the fuck is you be sniffing?\nCause when it come to riffing, I am the riff raffin\nGots to say nutting, niggas know they get had\nMotherfucker, Funk Flex, Vol. 3, The Final

That bitch with the crazy ass!\nAnother shorty, another party of your shady past!\n\n\nGod don't like ugly, all that love me, wanna plug me\nBut fuck me, it's about \"Is this really what you want G?\"\nThe more dirt you do, the more dirt you get\nMore fake niggas that ride, that'll jerk your dick\nThe more you think your slick, but somebody sees everything\nSometimes the thieves never hang\nThey remain, outlaws, wild dogs, outdoors\nStrippin' cats about yours, it's all about claws\nBeggin', scratchin', weighin' and matchin'\nYou stayin with the batch, and playin' with what you catchin'\nDo unto others, as you would have others do unto you, that's under you\nYou must first separate from, then connect with\nFuckin' with that X shit (WHAT), 'cos this the best shit (WHAT)\nMotherfuck the rest bitch (WHAT), it's all about this (WHAT)\nDo what you do, and you get what you get!\n\n\nSee what it boils down to, is that it all comes through\nRemember what you do, cause it's gon' come true\nA little harder than you did it, but that's the way it is\nI ain't know it be like this, but that's the way it is\nKeep fuckin' with them kids, cause they all get grown and shit\nWhen they get they own, what's gon' been that you shown 'em?\nFuck how to take a bone? How to rob a nigga of his throne?\nHow to be left standin' alone?\nGet a nigga gone, that ain't right\nDo it yourself, be a man and fight\nNigga earn your stripes, I damn sure earned mine\nI already know your language, now try to learn mine\nDig 'til you find, and when you find you keep\nI done spelled it out for you, but you niggas is still asleep\n6 feet deep, was just around the corner\nBe surprised how many niggas, wanna, wanna!\n X 2"}}, {"title": "Fuckin' wit' D", "album": "It's Dark and Hell is Hot", "year": "1998-05-19", "lyrics": "Grrrrrrrrrrrrrrr\n\nWhat's on y'all niggas minds, fucking with me\nY'all know somebody has told you about fucking with D\nStuck in a tree is what you will be like a cat\nAnother dog at the bottom looking up, now what's that?\nYour worst nightmare 'cause I take it right there\nYou got niggas coming?

games\nAnd don't ask me shit cuz I don't say no names\nSee what I know I'm taking to the fuckin' grave\nSo keep knockin cuz you ain't gettin a fuckin' thing\n\n\nAy yo\nWho we be was off the last joint\nBut now it's who we see and we forget the last joint\nCats ain't never walked like X\nEven before Kool G Rap talked like sex\nI've been around since at least 83\nSo ain't no sense in you motherfuckers hatin' me\nCuz I'm gon be here when you cats is gone\nAnd other cats is on, another batch is born\nDon't give a fuck about none of y'all\nFuck each and every one of y'all\nCuz I done done it all, been where ya at\nBeen where ya goin', then brought it back\nI tried to tell ya about it but you wouldn't listen\nNow I'm gonna take you to the hood cuz the hood will listen\nI wish you woulda listened cuz then you woulda known\nThat it's only right to give a dog a bone\nBitch\n\n\nAw Man\nThere are some things I can't stand\nWhen a nigga holla wanna shake my left hand\nWhen a nigga follow cuz he actin like my man\nNigga might as well swallow cuz he actin like a fan\nAnd I got balls like you do\nMan I got Paul to pull through you\nStan don't they know how we do\nEar to the streets with our hearts to the people\nGots to give a little to get somethin back\nAnd what you usually give see you ain't nothin black\nBut when you don't give then it won't last\nHis shit will disappear like wit a nigga that smoked fast\nYou'll get broke fast, that's the Lord's will\nHold up I think somebody's a the door, Shhh chill\nYou sit right there, I'm gonna answer that\nCuz when I finish poppin ain't nobody answerin back\n\n\nFuck it", "image": "https://images.genius.com/e730418bfaada4fc845d1179160af643.999x999x1.jpg", "artist": "DMX", "raw": {"annotation_count": 3, "api_path":

big dog baby gettin down like what\nSee I'm a thorough bread, I don't fuck wit much\nBloodline is where the pups at\nThey off the Grand Champ, yea what black\nDon't nothin move less, dog say so\nCats clueless about the way it go\nOff the chain I got at least 3 kills\nEven though my last album only did 3 mil\nI still give em chill cuz they feel dog\nI can't help what it is, shit is real dog\nYou must have thought that it was a joke or somethin'\nNow you done fucked around\nAnd got your man choked for frontin'\nNow hold up playa cuz I don't play those games\nAnd don't ask me shit cuz I don't say no names\nSee what I know I'm taking to the fuckin' grave\nSo keep knockin cuz you ain't gettin a fuckin' thing\n\n\nAy yo\nWho we be was off the last joint\nBut now it's who we see and we forget the last joint\nCats ain't never walked like X\nEven before Kool G Rap talked like sex\nI've been around since at least 83\nSo ain't no sense in you motherfuckers hatin' me\nCuz I'm gon be here when you cats is gone\nAnd other cats is on, another batch is born\nDon't give a fuck about none of y'all\nFuck each and every one of y'all\nCuz I done done it all, been where ya at\nBeen where ya goin', then brought it back\nI tried to tell ya about it but you wouldn't listen\nNow I'm gonna take you to the hood cuz the hood will listen\nI wish you woulda listened cuz then you woulda known\nThat it's only right to give a dog a bone\nBitch\n\n\nAw Man\nThere are some things I can't stand\nWhen a nigga holla wanna shake my left hand\nWhen a nigga follow cuz he actin like my man\nNigga might as well swallow cuz he actin like a fan\nAnd I got balls like you do\nMan I got Paul to pull through you\nStan don't they know how we do\nEar to the streets with our hearts to the people\nGots to give a little to get somethin back\nAnd what you usually give see you ain't nothin black\nBut when you don't give then it won't last\nHis shit will disappear like wit a nigga that smoked fast\nYou'll get broke fast, that's the Lord's will\nHold up I think somebody's a the door, Shhh chill\nYou sit right there, I'm gonna answer that\nCuz when I finish poppin ain't nobody answerin back\n\n\nFuck it"}},

for certain niggas, I'm hurting niggas\n(What you doing?) Robbing niggas, jerking niggas, sticking niggas\nCause they deserve it; when money got murdered\nThey know he died slow cause they heard it\nThe nigga ain't blew up the spot a while\nAnd the mother fucker ain't got shot in a while\nIt just takes a light up to fuck the night up\nBlow everything in sight up, fuck around and I'll have your ass right up\nWhen you mention some shit you wasn't able to stand\nI got shit that'll disable a man with the wave of a hand\nThe days are longer and seems like I'm facing time\nI've got a lot of dreams but I'm not really chasing mine\nI soak it all up like a sitting fly\nCause nowadays getting by, nothing more than an occasional meal and getting high\nI live to die, That's where I'm headed\nLet your man hold something, now it's all about you can get it\n\nYo, yo y'all niggas wanna be killers (get at me dog)\nY'all niggas wanna feel us (get at me dog)\nY'all niggas want the real (Get at me dog)\n(Rrrrrr arf arf, what the deal)\nYo, yo y'all niggas wanna be killers (get at me dog)\nY'all niggas wanna feel us (get at me dog)\nY'all niggas want the real (Get at me dog)\n(Rrrrrr arf arf, what the deal)\n\nWell in the back wit ya faggot ass face down\nLucky that you breathing, but you dead from the waist-down\nThe fuck is on your mind? Talking that shit that you be talking\nAnd I bet you wish you never got hit cause you be walking\nBut shit happens and fuck it, you done did your dirt\nNiggas is wondering how the fuck you hid your skirt\nRight under their eyes like a surprise to the guys\nThat one of their mans was a bitch in disguise\nFucking with cats that order more hits and slaughter more kids\nLet me holla at you yo Baltimore shit (ah-oh!)\nKnahmean? I'm just robbing to eat\nAnd there's at least a thousand of us like me mobbing the street\nWhen we're starving, we eat whatever's there\nCome on you know the code in the street; whatever's fair\nBlood stains and chalk, menas your man couldn't walk\nAfter the talk, about him not being 11-33 to New York\nTransforming-ass niggas'll get it quick\nAnd yo for real that nigga K can suck my dick\nAnd it's gon' take all these niggas in the rap game to barely move me\nCause when I blow shit up, I have niggas falling like white bitches in a scary movie\nAHHH! You know I don't know how to act\nGet too close to niggas it's like: \"Protected by Viper, stand back\"\nWhat's this? I thought you niggas was killers, demented\nThe fuck you want me to do with this coward?

fuck how niggas feel\nRob and I steal, not cause I want to cause I have to\nAnd don't make me show you what the MAC do\nIf you don't know by now then you slipping\nI'm on some bullshit that's got me jacking, niggas flipping\nLet my man and them stay pretty and I'ma stay shitty\nCruddy it's all for the money, is you wit' me?\nGet the bitches, and I'll commit the crime\nAnd when it's on we transform like Optimus Prime\nI'll form the head, roll out let's make it happen\nIf we ain't gonna get it wit them we'll take your cap\nBust it off dusting off the softest niggas\nMoney with the biggest mouth, yo let's off this nigga\nUp North this nigga never made a sound\nBreath too fucking hard and you're getting bust down\n\nYo, yo y'all niggas wanna be killers (get at me dog)\nY'all niggas wanna feel us (get at me dog)\nY'all niggas want the real (Get at me dog)\n(Rrrrrr arf arf, what the deal)\nYo, yo y'all niggas wanna be killers (get at me dog)\nY'all niggas wanna feel us (get at me dog)\nY'all niggas want the real (Get at me dog)\n(Rrrrrr arf arf, what the deal)\n\nNowadays it ain't looking too good for certain niggas, I'm hurting niggas\n(What you doing?) Robbing niggas, jerking niggas, sticking niggas\nCause they deserve it; when money got murdered\nThey know he died slow cause they heard it\nThe nigga ain't blew up the spot a while\nAnd the mother fucker ain't got shot in a while\nIt just takes a light up to fuck the night up\nBlow everything in sight up, fuck around and I'll have your ass right up\nWhen you mention some shit you wasn't able to stand\nI got shit that'll disable a man with the wave of a hand\nThe days are longer and seems like I'm facing time\nI've got a lot of dreams but I'm not really chasing mine\nI soak it all up like a sitting fly\nCause nowadays getting by, nothing more than an occasional meal and getting high\nI live to die, That's where I'm headed\nLet your man hold something, now it's all about you can get it\n\nYo, yo y'all niggas wanna be killers (get at me dog)\nY'all niggas wanna feel us (get at me dog)\nY'all niggas want the real (Get at me dog)\n(Rrrrrr arf arf, what the deal)\nYo, yo y'all niggas wanna be killers (get at me dog)\nY'all niggas wanna feel us (get at me dog)\nY'all niggas want the real (Get at me dog)\n(Rrrrrr arf arf, what the deal)\n\nWell in the back wit ya faggot ass face down\nLucky that you breathing, but you dead from the waist-down\nThe fuck is on your mind? Talking that shit that you be talking\nAnd I bet you wish you never got hit cause you be walking\nBut shit happens and fuck it, you done did your dirt\nNiggas is wondering how the fuck you hid your skirt\nRight under their eyes like a surprise to the guys\nThat one of their mans was a bitch in disguise\nFucking with cats that order more hits and slaughter more kids\nLet me holla at you yo Baltimore shit (ah-oh!)\nKnahmean? I'm just robbing to eat\nAnd there's at least a thousand of us like me mobbing the street\nWhen we're starving, we eat whatever's there\nCome on you know the code in the street; whatever's fair\nBlood stains and chalk, menas your man couldn't walk\nAfter the talk, about him not being 11-33 to New York\nTransforming-ass niggas'll get it quick\nAnd yo for real that nigga K can suck my dick\nAnd it's gon' take all these niggas in the rap game to barely move me\nCause when I blow shit up, I have niggas falling like white bitches in a scary movie\nAHHH! You know I don't know how to act\nGet too close to niggas it's like: \"Protected by Viper, stand back\"\nWhat's this? I thought you niggas was killers, demented\nThe fuck you want me to do with this coward? Finish him, it's ended\n(*EXPLOSION*)"}}, {"title": "Get At Me Dog (Bad Boy Remix)", "album": null, "year": "1998-02-10", "lyrics": "Intro: Styles:\nWhat! Niggas can't fuck with us\nDMX:\nGet at me dog. My niggas\nStyles:\nThat's my word!\nVerse One: DMX\nI'm the type to kick back and look at shit\n'cause crooked shit gets me amped\nAnd what you don't know, will get you locked in sleep away camp\nGrand champ and raise more hell, than a Sorrel\nSee you at the peephole, bustin' at the doorbell\nThough I wasn't coming without mine\nYou put me on the front line because you doubt mine\nBet your and lost yours, you come to get your I tossed yours\nAnd it cost yours, fuck y'all niggas stupid, I'm the boss dog\nWhat more dirt must I do, plus my crew\nBusts at you, and you be like \"What's that oooh\"\nWhat's that Clue, do I bring the noise what\nDestroy these mutts, is these niggas toys or what\nBring all the pretty niggas thinking they shitty, what a pity\nLemme show them niggas shitty some pity, but for fifty\nA motherfucker will get a bullet to hum to him, put the gun to him\nHit 'em with something that comes to him, bet it runs through him\nLook at what I done to him, no more smiles\nGot the whole top half of his head, running wild\nBut you don't hear me though, so I turn out the lights\nWe can take it to the streets dog, turn off the mics\nIf you want war, then you want more, than you can stand\nAnd this 44, will leave you with your dick in the sand\nWho the man, and now you cats know for real\nGet at me dog, (bark), what the deal\nVerse Two: Styles\nY'all niggas fucking with the L.O.X\nYour stuck on a rock\nGot that Alcatraz flow\nYou just don't know\nLifetime kid caged in blazin'\nAny type of rapper or federal agent\nPaniro the made man, blade man\nStand up type of guy, your living a lie\nNiggas wanna be pretty and fly but kiddies will die\nThe dogs run the city, bet fifty on mine\nTwo grams for you to sniff, how silly am I\nGot a lot of jokes don't, kill yo ass won't I\nMaybe not if the spot is filled up with po 9\nMany niggas get it confused, blame the rules\nOnly ask the how's not the who's\nBetter off busting your tool, then we might get the crew\nBut as far as rap goes, you a motherfucking fool\nIf you don't want chips, you should have stayed in school\nYou and 8-ball nigga, you wanna play pool\nI'll put you in the side pocket, look at the size of my rocket\nStyles don't lie, cop the work then clock it\nBoxes full of boots, jeans, suits and watches\nNiggas don't pump if they can't make a profit\nStop it, before we pull it back then cop it\nVacant lot niggas come through then we lock it\n(WHAT, WHAT, WHAT)\nVerse Three: Jadakiss\nWith no Glocks I'm in your town with five locks\nTake five blocks, come back with five trucks, with knots\nIt's the L.O.X, three niggas that listen and watch\nAnd nigga you know, whenever we spit, it's hot\nIt be that new flow, my niggas, fly niggas\nAlways high niggas, ready to die niggas\nAs far as I'm hearing, y'all doing a lot of comparing\nLemme get the one clearance like a sample\n'Kiss is the champ and I know that you don't wanna get stamped\nLeft somewhere cramp, so when it rains, you get damp\nNiggas is done, since poppy raised his son\nWhen bringing in drums, to bring all g's to bums\nWhether you can flow or not ain't the issue\nYou don't Jay to kiss you, his lyrics pierce the gristle\nTake a puff then a swig\nThink about how I'm gonna\nHold it down for Big, my motherfucking nig\nYour money is low, and your flow been late\nWhile I be coming through with new shit with tint plates\nThe only higher than money, is respect\nThe only thing hotter than my click, is a tek\nSo when I hit you with these last bars around your neck\nYou gonna know never to fuck around with L-O-X nigga\n(WHAT, YEAH)\nVerse Four: Sheek Luchion\nMy bank account be doubling\nWhile you niggas stay in trouble and\nL.O.X. stay fly\nThree niggas jig-I\nShit you never seen before, Feds hit the repo law\nKingpin, 10 mil. each of us popular\nIt's Sheek baby\nChicks hate to see me on the Soul Train\nWith Don Cornelius\nAnd all they got is alias\nTo work with\nTo catch Sheek, y'all niggas besta work quick\nNow that I'm eating right, plus living well\nSo nowadays when I burp, it's fettucini you smell\nAin't that right poppa-san, used to push a Nissan\nWith a black master full 850 full suspension\nWhile you collect your pension, I ain't worked in years\nMy stomach is fat from Puerto Rican food, while yours is scarce\nSmall black haired, chinky-eyed Puerto Rican mama\nKeep them laced in the scadda, half the closet on product\nI learn things, just by watching y'all niggas make the wrong moves\nNow I know what not to do, to make more than y'all fools\nY'all think we ignorant, 'cause we don't budge unless we benefit\nCats that take the light that's scarce and see what's at the end of it\nP.H. me, because a nigga wisks me up in Jake B\nYour shit be so-so, low pro\nOn a bus before the cars show\nOn some old joystick shit, no mirrors\nI can see behind me through the cameras\nFlip plates, make the whole block go bananas", "image":

Styles:\nWhat! Niggas can't fuck with us\nDMX:\nGet at me dog. My niggas\nStyles:\nThat's my word!\nVerse One: DMX\nI'm the type to kick back and look at shit\n'cause crooked shit gets me amped\nAnd what you don't know, will get you locked in sleep away camp\nGrand champ and raise more hell, than a Sorrel\nSee you at the peephole, bustin' at the doorbell\nThough I wasn't coming without mine\nYou put me on the front line because you doubt mine\nBet your and lost yours, you come to get your I tossed yours\nAnd it cost yours, fuck y'all niggas stupid, I'm the boss dog\nWhat more dirt must I do, plus my crew\nBusts at you, and you be like \"What's that oooh\"\nWhat's that Clue, do I bring the noise what\nDestroy these mutts, is these niggas toys or what\nBring all the pretty niggas thinking they shitty, what a pity\nLemme show them niggas shitty some pity, but for fifty\nA motherfucker will get a bullet to hum to him, put the gun to him\nHit 'em with something that comes to him, bet it runs through him\nLook at what I done to him, no more smiles\nGot the whole top half of his head, running wild\nBut you don't hear me though, so I turn out the lights\nWe can take it to the streets dog, turn off the mics\nIf you want war, then you want more, than you can stand\nAnd this 44, will leave you with your dick in the sand\nWho the man, and now you cats know for real\nGet at me dog, (bark), what the deal\nVerse Two: Styles\nY'all niggas fucking with the L.O.X\nYour stuck on a rock\nGot that Alcatraz flow\nYou just don't know\nLifetime kid caged in blazin'\nAny type of rapper or federal agent\nPaniro the made man, blade man\nStand up type of guy, your living a lie\nNiggas wanna be pretty and fly but kiddies will die\nThe dogs run the city, bet fifty on mine\nTwo grams for you to sniff, how silly am I\nGot a lot of jokes don't, kill yo ass won't I\nMaybe not if the spot is filled up with po 9\nMany niggas get it confused, blame the rules\nOnly ask the how's not the who's\nBetter off busting your tool, then we might get the crew\nBut as far as rap goes, you a motherfucking fool\nIf you don't want chips, you should have stayed in school\nYou and 8-ball nigga, you wanna play pool\nI'll put you in the side pocket, look at the size of my rocket\nStyles don't lie, cop the work then clock it\nBoxes full of boots, jeans, suits and watches\nNiggas don't pump if they can't make a profit\nStop it, before we pull it back then cop it\nVacant lot niggas come through then we lock it\n(WHAT, WHAT, WHAT)\nVerse Three: Jadakiss\nWith no Glocks I'm in your town with five locks\nTake five blocks, come back with five trucks, with knots\nIt's the L.O.X, three niggas that listen and watch\nAnd nigga you know, whenever we spit, it's hot\nIt be that new flow, my niggas, fly niggas\nAlways high niggas, ready to die niggas\nAs far as I'm hearing, y'all doing a lot of comparing\nLemme get the one clearance like a sample\n'Kiss is the champ and I know that you don't wanna get stamped\nLeft somewhere cramp, so when it rains, you get damp\nNiggas is done, since poppy raised his son\nWhen bringing in drums, to bring all g's to bums\nWhether you can flow or not ain't the issue\nYou don't Jay to kiss you, his lyrics pierce the gristle\nTake a puff then a swig\nThink about how I'm gonna\nHold it down for Big, my motherfucking nig\nYour money is low, and your flow been late\nWhile I be coming through with new shit with tint plates\nThe only higher than money, is respect\nThe only thing hotter than my click, is a tek\nSo when I hit you with these last bars around your neck\nYou gonna know never to fuck around with L-O-X nigga\n(WHAT, YEAH)\nVerse Four: Sheek Luchion\nMy bank account be doubling\nWhile you niggas stay in trouble and\nL.O.X. stay fly\nThree niggas jig-I\nShit you never seen before, Feds hit the repo law\nKingpin, 10 mil. each of us popular\nIt's Sheek baby\nChicks hate to see me on the Soul Train\nWith Don Cornelius\nAnd all they got is alias\nTo work with\nTo catch Sheek, y'all niggas besta work quick\nNow that I'm eating right, plus living well\nSo nowadays when I burp, it's fettucini you smell\nAin't that right poppa-san, used to push a Nissan\nWith a black master full 850 full suspension\nWhile you collect your pension, I ain't worked in years\nMy stomach is fat from Puerto Rican food, while yours is scarce\nSmall black haired, chinky-eyed Puerto Rican mama\nKeep them laced in the scadda, half the closet on product\nI learn things, just by watching y'all niggas make the wrong moves\nNow I know what not to do, to make more than y'all fools\nY'all think we ignorant, 'cause we don't budge unless we benefit\nCats that take the light that's scarce and see what's at the end of it\nP.H. me, because a nigga wisks me up in Jake B\nYour shit be so-so, low pro\nOn a bus before the cars show\nOn some old joystick shit, no mirrors\nI can see behind me through the cameras\nFlip plates, make the whole block go bananas"}}, {"title": "Get At Me Dog (Remix)", "album":

thirst I'll wet first\nNow wait a minute it gets worse\nI can't control what I own inside\nSo I take it out on the soul of that kid that died\nSpit fire, cross niggas like barbecues\nMobbin crews, strippin niggas, robbin crews\nAnd put him speechless, when I made him eat this\nHollow tip and you can follow grip\nYou be like Kim and ain't gon swallow shit\nDon't know the half, couldn't know the math\nTo understand the wrath of a man split in half\nBut he got what he wanted, shot for three hundred\nShit is tight and a nigga that's right gots to run it\nAin't no question, that's how I get down\nNiggas know gimme yo' dough and yo' hoe, and here take these fo'\nHot things I got things that make niggas spin\nPut niggas in the wind, where you never see niggas again\nBless a nigga with

popped, still I burn to hell\nCall the police and whatever they don't seize\nAnd put in they mouth, and catch freeze, tell em throw Drag some keys\nDon't care how many oyeas I gotta make believe\nIf you nervous, you don't deserve it poppi please\nCats stealin gats y'all probably will get hit\nWell I'm the future let's see y'all copy this, stopping this\nSince a tiny kid like, \"mommy buy me this\"\nSince she always told me no, started stealin on some grimy shit\nLike look at that, now look at that slide it in my bookbag\nI'm who, parents point they fingers at, \"get from that hoodrat\"\nAnd put it back, fuck tough, while y'all cook crack\nI'm cocaine, throw me in the pot, I rise to the top\nWith your 5.0, go 'head, look ma, I got four more pegs\nStil put them holes in yo' head, til it's mushy like dough bread\nCuz that vest only protects that chest\nAnd if I decide to get ice, don't get to fascinated\nOr it's my bullet, your brain, mashed potatoes\nDouble R got me

act on\nMessin with the team, its gon be a sad song\nX will bring the day and the night\nCuz we get it right, hit it right, get it right, spit it right\nMoves is made, niggas is paid, that's just how it is\nWhen my time is up I'ma be out but I'ma try to live\nI'm eatin day by day, ain't nothin sweet about it\nAct like you don't know what I'm sayin then you read about it\nBuilt for war like a armadillo\nSmother yo' ass with too good a pilllow\nHear my shit is brillo\nManic depressive and my head hurts\nSince theres a dead thirst I'll wet first\nNow wait a minute it gets worse\nI can't control what I own inside\nSo I take it out on the soul of that kid that died\nSpit fire, cross niggas like barbecues\nMobbin crews, strippin niggas, robbin crews\nAnd put him speechless, when I made him eat this\nHollow tip and you can follow grip\nYou be like Kim and ain't gon swallow shit\nDon't know the half, couldn't know the math\nTo understand the wrath of a man split in half\nBut he got what he wanted, shot for three hundred\nShit is tight and a nigga that's right gots to run it\nAin't no question, that's how I get down\nNiggas know gimme yo' dough and yo' hoe, and here take these fo'\nHot things I got things that make niggas spin\nPut niggas in the wind, where you never see niggas again\nBless a nigga with fifties the thin types\nAnd a straight blast that'll put pinstripes across your windpipe\nDrag-On, niggas act on\nMessin with the team, its gon be a sad song\nX will bring the day and the night\nCuz we get it right, hit it right, get it right, spit it right\nDrag-On, niggas act on\nMessin with the team, its gon be a sad song\nX will bring the day and the night\nCuz we get it right, hit it right, get it right, spit it right\nDrag opposite water more than a spot order\nMy flows cause fire then bring holes\nTakes more than a pump to out this little punk\n'less that pump is a twelve, and I get popped, still I burn to hell\nCall the police and whatever they don't seize\nAnd put in they mouth, and catch freeze, tell em throw Drag some keys\nDon't care how many oyeas I gotta make believe\nIf you nervous, you don't deserve it poppi please\nCats stealin gats y'all probably will get hit\nWell I'm the future let's see y'all copy this, stopping this\nSince a tiny kid like, \"mommy buy me this\"\nSince she always told me no, started stealin on some grimy shit\nLike look at that, now look at that slide it in my bookbag\nI'm who, parents point they fingers at, \"get from that hoodrat\"\nAnd put it back, fuck tough, while y'all cook crack\nI'm cocaine, throw me in the pot, I rise to the top\nWith your 5.0, go 'head, look ma, I got four more pegs\nStil put them holes in yo' head, til it's mushy like dough bread\nCuz that vest only protects that chest\nAnd if I decide to get ice, don't get to fascinated\nOr it's my bullet, your brain, mashed potatoes\nDouble R got me comin hard on you haters\nCuz we the streets black and y'all belong beneath that\nDrag-On, niggas act on\nMessin with the team, its gon be a sad song\nX will bring the day and the night\nCuz we get it right, hit it right, get it right, spit it right\nDrag-On, niggas act on\nMessin with the team, its gon be a sad song\nX will bring the day and the night\nCuz we get it right, hit it right, get it right, spit it right"}}, {"title": "Getting Down", "album": "Cradle 2 The

you don't want to war with me\n\nGetting down for what we stand for because it don't stop\nOnce the line's crossed\nGetting down for what we stand for cause it don't stop\nOnce the line's crossed\n\nI

figure\nNine to your tongue while I play with the trigger\nWill make you understand what I say a lot quicker\nDo we have an understanding, yeah, my nigga\nIn case I be fronting, know they really don't want it with me\nCome coming with them hollows and heaters - to put it, simply\nSo if your team don't follow its leader, then come, and get me\nBut all you cowards better believe it - you coming with me\n\nGetting down for what we stand for because it don't stop\nOnce the line's crossed\nGetting down for what we stand for cause it don't stop\nOnce the line's crossed\n\nI'm known for getting up in

for sure\nBecause once you cross the line, you already know we get dough\nThe quicker they slip, the quicker their ready\nHoles in your Pelle, body laid up in the back of the deli\nI thought you all already knew about me and these triggers\nGet touched if you ever fuck with me and these niggas\nThe bitch is loose, got niggas like 'Bitch you loose'\nI'm the realest bitch of them all\nBecause I get

there\nPut your man's brains in the motherfuckin air\nPop, pop, pop, you drop, drop, drop, stopping\nLook at what I've done to you niggas\nI don't want to be your father, tired of sonning you niggas\nAnd, I'm sick of being bothered, I'm confronting you niggas\nAnd take this And, run, in a minute, I'm hunting you nigga\n\nGetting down for what we stand for because it don't stop\nOnce the

momma\nPut that bitch in trauma, you don't want to war with me\n\nGetting down for what we stand for because it don't stop\nOnce the line's crossed\nGetting down for what we stand for cause it don't stop\nOnce the line's crossed\n\nI don't have to use the fifth to be a threat\nI stand six foot three, four thirty, any less\nMotherfuckers' want their shit split, I ain't the one to test\nUnderstand what I'm saying, if not, how I figure\nNine to your tongue while I play with the trigger\nWill make you understand what I say a lot quicker\nDo we have an understanding, yeah, my nigga\nIn case I be fronting, know they really don't want it with me\nCome coming with them hollows and heaters - to put it, simply\nSo if your team don't follow its leader, then come, and get me\nBut all you cowards better believe it - you coming with me\n\nGetting down for what we stand for because it don't stop\nOnce the line's crossed\nGetting down for what we stand for cause it don't stop\nOnce the line's crossed\n\nI'm known for getting up in these niggas' ass\nAnd they don't want to, fuck with the bitch of this shit\nBecause I position the hits, speak with the nine\nNiggas ain't ready for that shit that I spit\nOh no, get at these niggas for sure\nBecause once you cross the line, you already know we get dough\nThe quicker they slip, the quicker their ready\nHoles in your Pelle, body laid up in the back of the deli\nI thought you all already knew about me and these triggers\nGet touched if you ever fuck with me and these niggas\nThe bitch is loose, got niggas like 'Bitch you loose'\nI'm the realest bitch of them all\nBecause I get down for what I stand for\n\nGetting down for what we stand for because it don't stop\nOnce the line's crossed\nGetting down for what we stand for cause it don't stop\nOnce the line's crossed\n\nFuck I've got to say it for, you already know\nI was going dizzy, I get busy with the flow\nOh, it's like that, alright, aye yo\nNiggas coming through anytime, anywhere\nPop up and pop niggas, up right there\nPut your man's brains in the motherfuckin air\nPop, pop, pop, you drop, drop, drop, stopping\nLook at what I've done to you niggas\nI don't want to be your father, tired of sonning you niggas\nAnd, I'm sick of being bothered, I'm confronting you niggas\nAnd take this And, run, in a minute, I'm hunting you nigga\n\nGetting down for what we stand for because it don't stop\nOnce the line's crossed\nGetting down for what we stand for cause it don't stop\nOnce the line's crossed"}}, {"title": "Get Up and Try Again", "album": "Redemption of the

like\nMake sure you know what the rain is but its gonna be coming down like\nCats and dogs hold up it is cats and dogs\nKeep fucking with the dog its gonna be cats in the morgue\nTwenty- two million sold lets keep it real\nMost y'all killers ain't even twenty- two years old\nAin't never felt the cold wet behind the ears\nKnow what real pain is cried real tears\nI go hard bogard and stand my ground\nFuck y'all niggas it's how its goin down baby\n\n\nIt just don't look right\nBullshit coke don't cook right\nThe judge ain't throwin the book right\nShould thank the lord that you blew up softy\nDon't talk greasy, you grew up off me\nI ain't letting go of the block\nAnd if I get a good enough grip I ain't lettin go of the lock\nIf I happen to pinched I ain't goin to shock\nI'm gonna to get aquatinted with niggas in general pop\nStop but don't hate cause everybody got a lil blood to donate\nThugs'll go ape the women'll come around\nShortly after that is when the jealousy sets in then they'll shut it down\nIt's just raspy nothin on the neck wrist ware just classy\nNo way I'm letting this money just get past me\nWhen all I had to do in the first place from the beginning was get nasty\n\n\nNiggas been waitin' for that west coast shit I tell them to go fish\nBlowin purple in a purple Laker jersey wit the gold kicks\nBitches be like Toon you a mutha fuckin trip\nHop in the whip and lean til that mutha fucka flip\nAnd every club in Cali crackin' its gangsta town\nKeep a couple of niggas with me that'll bang you down\nNow lil mama put switches on and make it jump\nBefore me you needed Lil Jon to make it crunk\nNaw for real come to Cali player take ya pump\nMy New York niggas leave y'all wit razor bumps\nNow pappa raised a rolling stone I feel like pops\nIn the absence of Makaveli I feel like Pac\nEven though I got the deal I still might pop\nRight in front of the po-po you could feel my shots\nMan all my niggas carry bangers we feel like SWAT\nAnd that's the reason

crunk\nBitches bounce niggas bounce\nLet me give you that funk shit blunt shit\nWhile I make you bang it out your trunk\n\nYou cats, talk slick but walk quick when the dog hit\nThe dog hits coming back to the raw shit\nAww shit they done let me back out the gate\nBack out to tape back out to rape\nBack off the chains so please back out the way\nBefore I blow ya back out with this fuckin AK\nDon't give a fuck what a nigga say no matter who he sound like\nMake sure you know what the rain is but its gonna be coming down like\nCats and dogs hold up it is cats and dogs\nKeep fucking with the dog its gonna be cats in the morgue\nTwenty- two million sold lets keep it real\nMost y'all killers ain't even twenty- two years old\nAin't never felt the cold wet behind the ears\nKnow what real pain is cried real tears\nI go hard bogard and stand my ground\nFuck y'all niggas it's how its goin down baby\n\n\nIt just don't look right\nBullshit coke don't cook right\nThe judge ain't throwin the book right\nShould thank the lord that you blew up softy\nDon't talk greasy, you grew up off me\nI ain't letting go of the block\nAnd if I get a good enough grip I ain't lettin go of the lock\nIf I happen to pinched I ain't goin to shock\nI'm gonna to get aquatinted with niggas in general pop\nStop but don't hate cause everybody got a lil blood to donate\nThugs'll go ape the women'll come around\nShortly after that is when the jealousy sets in then they'll shut it down\nIt's just raspy nothin on the neck wrist ware just classy\nNo way I'm letting this money just get past me\nWhen all I had to do in the first place from the beginning was get nasty\n\n\nNiggas been waitin' for that west coast shit I tell them to go fish\nBlowin purple in a purple Laker jersey wit the gold kicks\nBitches be like Toon you a mutha fuckin trip\nHop in the whip and lean til that mutha fucka flip\nAnd every club in Cali crackin' its gangsta town\nKeep a couple of niggas with me that'll bang you down\nNow lil mama put switches on and make it jump\nBefore me you needed Lil Jon to make it crunk\nNaw for real come to Cali player take ya pump\nMy New York niggas leave y'all wit razor bumps\nNow pappa raised a rolling stone I feel like pops\nIn the absence of Makaveli I feel like Pac\nEven though I got the deal I still might pop\nRight in front of the po-po you could feel my shots\nMan all my niggas carry bangers we feel like SWAT\nAnd that's the reason why Rialto feel like Watts"}}, {"title": "Get Your Money Up", "album": "Undisputed", "year": "2012-09-11", "lyrics":

I'ma give you a try because I think your kinda fly and you're my type of guy,\"\nShe said her name was Crystal and she kept the pistol on her and if I ever cheated\nBelieve I be a goner, so I played the perfect gentleman ever time I was wit' her\nAnd when I wasn't wit her I was going to get her when I wasn't going to get her she was coming to get me\nThen when she wasn't coming to get me she was wit me\nSo for a while everything was smooth, I waited and contemplated my next move\nMy instinct had told that the time was right for us to get together\nFor a magical night so I called her, she said \"Hello\" I said \"Hey\"\nShe said \"Wait, I already know what you have to say,\" she said \"Baby, I know you're wondering\nWhy I won't go over to your place because I'm not too sure about how you feel\nSo I'd rather go at my own pace, Oh I don't know\nThe way that I feel I'm so afraid of a one night deal\nI--\" Hold up sweetheart, just chill, relax your telling me the answer\nAnd I didn't even ask don't you think that we should be alone this is not the type of thing to\nTalk about over the phone, why don't you \"Come on and go with me\nCome on over to my place.\" Where we can sit down and talk about it face to face\nWhy don't you \"Come on and go with me\nCome on over to my place\"\nWhere we can discuss the (?) of picking up the pace She said\n\"I thought about it and I think that your right but, my parents are home so\nIt won't be tonight but, um why don't you come over tomorrow at 8 my parents leave at 7:30 and won't be back until late.\"\nI said \"Then let me go and get set tomorrow will be a day that you will not forget\"\nSo the next day around 7:54 I picked up like 6 condoms and headed for the door stepped outside\nI was asked where was I going by detectives with nine millimetres that were showing\nI said \"To my girls house.\" They said \"No you aren't,\" I said \"Why not?\"\nThey said because they have a warrant\nI said \"That's impossible how can that be?\" They said \"It's right here\nRobbery, first degree.\" Well anyway to make a long story short I ended up in (?)\nGoing to court so I call Crystal the night around 8 I said \"It's just a mix up\"\nAnd blamed it on fate she told me that she loved me and promised to wait she said \"I'll see you in court\nOn your next court date.\" Despite being locked up things weren't bad\nI still had my girl and for that I was glad\nShe always came to visit didn't mind the (?) and every night I wrote a letter telling her things like\n{Bridge}\nI can't feel myself, I don't want nobody else to ever love me\nYou are my shining star, my guiding light, my love (?)\nThere's not a minute, hour, day or night that I don't love you\nYou're at the top of my lips cause I'm always thinking of you\nI still remember in the days when I was scared to touch you\nHow I spent my daydreaming learning how to say \"I love you\"\nYou must've known that I had feelings deep enough to swim in\nThat's when you opened up your heart and you told me to come in\nOh mama!\nA thousand kisses from you is never too much\nAnd I just don't wanna stop\n{Verse 2}\nDays turned into weeks, weeks into months\n10 days to 25th and I've only gotten mail once\nWhat had happened to my love life\nWhy do I feel like I've been stabbed in the back with a knife\nI tried to believe I said she loves me, she does but deep down\nI knew what the scoop really was you see\nJody had my girl and now she was gone\nJust thinking about it had me singing every love song\nI'm thinking to my self how could she do me wrong but it's not her fault\nI was away for too long I thought I had a girlfriend but now I know better\nShe told me that she wrote me but I never got the letter\nEvery time I tried to call her nobody was home\nAnd since I had to call collect she put a block on the phone\nShe told me she would visit but damn I haven't seen her\nYou wanna know why because Jody is in between her legs and getting busy\nHe even ate the coochie, yo I bought her everything from Fendi to Gucci\nBut (?) in something that I didn't even have to sweat her\nAnd if it doesn't happen by now it's gonna get her um\n{Bridge}\n\"Thrown up in the middle I don't know what to do\nWhat do you do when your girl is untrue\nThere's another man, another man\nIn my life, in my life\nOhh, another man is beating my time\nAnother man is loving mine\nOhh, another man is beating my time\nAnother man is loving mine\n{Verse 3}\nBeating my time\nAnother man was loving mine\nI was upset but there were other things on my mind\nI would start trial soon and was facing a lot of time\nAnd on the day of trial I was nervous for a while but when they said not guilty\nI stepped with a smile back to freedom, freedom on the streets again\nWhere I had to go and see what was up with my friend\nSo I called her just to make sure she was home I said \"Hello,\"\nAnd a man's voice answered the phone I was confused at first I didn't know what to do\nSaid who is this he said \"It's Jody and what is it to you?\"\nI turned up the receiver, picked up my gun, and straight for Crystal's crib\nI started running murder, murder my fingers on the trigger murder, murder\nI'ma murder this nigga. So then I thought why should I do him? He wouldn't have no pussy if she didn't give it to him\nI thought about killing him thought about it twice said \"Nah.\"\nWhy because it wouldn't be nice and for the sake of curiosity I had to go see Crystal\nAnd ask her why did it have to be me? I knocked on the door and just like before\nI heard a man's voice saying he couldn't take it any more the door opened up\nBut Jody (?) he looked me up and down and said I guess (?)\nNow here comes Crystal yelling and fussing, hollering screaming, shouting and cussing\nShe looked at me and (?) got quiet in the hall she (?) and why didn't you call\nI turned around to leave and she said \"Please don't go,\" I said \"You used to be my girl\nNow you're nothing but a ho I understand cause I'm a man but there's no (?) in stake\n\"So I spread my wings and fly away, yeah\"\n{Outro}\nYou know what

affection I place nothing above 'em\n(?) that I'm possessing I (?) truly love 'em\nShort ones tall ones big ones small ones\nWinter spring summer and fall yo I love 'em all\nEspecially the cuties with the smooth complexions and shapely booties\nWith the type of bodies that'll make you say \"Oh boy.\"\nYup but baby if you're ugly I ain't got nothing for ya\nI'm not conceited, I'm convinced that I've been naturally blessed\nTo (?) and irresistible with (?)\nAnd what's that get that breaks down (?) a cutie I bag 'em\nThe instant I see a cutie with a bootie wiggle it just like jello\nTo me being a player approach and say hello but she didn't hear me\nSo I tapped her softly, She turned around screaming on me \"Back up off me!\"\nI said \"Damn, there is no need for hostility, I'm a mellow type of fellow\"\nInstil the tranquillity, She said \"I recognize all of y'all are the same only after one thing\nAnd kinda swift with the game\" I said \"Come on now sweetheart do I look like a player?\"\nShe said \"Of course not, psych.\" (?) let me know the deal I wanna ask you\n\"Are you for real, are you really for real is this love that I can't believe the way you make me feel\nAre you for real?\" As real as it gets my name is not James Brown but I believe you in a cold sweat\nAnd I bet there's no if, ands, and maybes when I'm finished I will have you sayin' \"Do me baby.\"\nShe said, \"(?) I'ma give you a try because I think your kinda fly and you're my type of guy,\"\nShe said her name was Crystal and she kept the pistol on her and if I ever cheated\nBelieve I be a goner, so I played the perfect gentleman ever time I was wit' her\nAnd when I wasn't wit her I was going to get her when I wasn't going to get her she was coming to get me\nThen when she wasn't coming to get me she was wit me\nSo for a while everything was smooth, I waited and contemplated my next move\nMy instinct had told that the time was right for us to get together\nFor a magical night so I called her, she said \"Hello\" I said \"Hey\"\nShe said \"Wait, I already know what you have to say,\" she said \"Baby, I know you're wondering\nWhy I won't go over to your place because I'm not too sure about how you feel\nSo I'd rather go at my own pace, Oh I don't know\nThe way that I feel I'm so afraid of a one night deal\nI--\" Hold up sweetheart, just chill, relax your telling me the answer\nAnd I didn't even ask don't you think that we should be alone this is not the type of thing to\nTalk about over the phone, why don't you \"Come on and go with me\nCome on over to my place.\" Where we can sit down and talk about it face to face\nWhy don't you \"Come on and go with me\nCome on over to my place\"\nWhere we can discuss the (?) of picking up the pace She said\n\"I thought about it and I think that your right but, my parents are home so\nIt won't be tonight but, um why don't you come over tomorrow at 8 my parents leave at 7:30 and won't be back until late.\"\nI said \"Then let me go and get set tomorrow will be a day that you will not forget\"\nSo the next day around 7:54 I picked up like 6 condoms and headed for the door stepped outside\nI was asked where was I going by detectives with nine millimetres that were showing\nI said \"To my girls house.\" They said \"No you aren't,\" I said \"Why not?\"\nThey said because they have a warrant\nI said \"That's impossible how can that be?\" They said \"It's right here\nRobbery, first degree.\" Well anyway to make a long story short I ended up in (?)\nGoing to court so I call Crystal the night around 8 I said \"It's just a mix up\"\nAnd blamed it on fate she told me that she loved me and promised to wait she said \"I'll see you in court\nOn your next court date.\" Despite being locked up things weren't bad\nI still had my girl and for that I was glad\nShe always came to visit didn't mind the (?) and every night I wrote a letter telling her things like\n{Bridge}\nI can't feel myself, I don't want nobody else to ever love me\nYou are my shining star, my guiding light, my love (?)\nThere's not a minute, hour, day or night that I don't love you\nYou're at the top of my lips cause I'm always thinking of you\nI still remember in the days when I was scared to touch you\nHow I spent my daydreaming learning how to say \"I love you\"\nYou must've known that I had feelings deep enough to swim in\nThat's when you opened up your heart and you told me to come in\nOh mama!\nA thousand kisses from you is never too much\nAnd I just don't wanna stop\n{Verse 2}\nDays turned into weeks, weeks into months\n10 days to 25th and I've only gotten mail once\nWhat had happened to my love life\nWhy do I feel like I've been stabbed in the back with a knife\nI tried to believe I said she loves me, she does but deep down\nI knew what the scoop really was you see\nJody had my girl and now she was gone\nJust thinking about it had me singing every love song\nI'm thinking to my self how could she do me wrong but it's not her fault\nI was away for too long I thought I had a girlfriend but now I know better\nShe told me that she wrote me but I never got the letter\nEvery time I tried to call her nobody was home\nAnd since I had to call collect she put a block on the phone\nShe told me she would visit but damn I haven't seen her\nYou wanna know why because Jody is in between her legs and getting busy\nHe even ate the coochie, yo I bought her everything from Fendi to Gucci\nBut (?) in something that I didn't even have to sweat her\nAnd if it doesn't happen by now it's gonna get her um\n{Bridge}\n\"Thrown up in the middle I don't know what to do\nWhat do you do when your girl is untrue\nThere's another man, another man\nIn my life, in my life\nOhh, another man is beating my time\nAnother man is loving mine\nOhh, another man is beating my time\nAnother man is loving mine\n{Verse 3}\nBeating my time\nAnother man was loving mine\nI was upset but there were other things on my mind\nI would start trial soon and was facing a lot of time\nAnd on the day of trial I was nervous for a while but when they said not guilty\nI stepped with a smile back to freedom, freedom on the streets again\nWhere I had to go and see what was up with my friend\nSo I called her just to make sure she was home I said \"Hello,\"\nAnd a man's voice answered the phone I was confused at first I didn't know what to do\nSaid who is this he said \"It's Jody and what is it to you?\"\nI turned up the receiver, picked up my gun, and straight for Crystal's crib\nI started running murder, murder my fingers on the trigger murder, murder\nI'ma murder this nigga. So then I thought why should I do him? He wouldn't have no pussy if she didn't give it to him\nI thought about killing him thought about it twice said \"Nah.\"\nWhy because it wouldn't be nice and for the sake of curiosity I had to go see Crystal\nAnd ask her why did it have to be me? I knocked on the door and just like before\nI heard a man's voice saying he couldn't take it any more the door opened up\nBut Jody (?) he looked me up and down and said I guess (?)\nNow here comes Crystal yelling and fussing, hollering screaming, shouting and cussing\nShe looked at me and (?) got quiet in the hall she (?) and why didn't you call\nI turned around to leave and she said \"Please don't go,\" I said \"You used to be my girl\nNow you're nothing but a ho I understand cause I'm a man but there's no (?) in stake\n\"So I spread my wings and fly away, yeah\"\n{Outro}\nYou know what I'm sayin?\nDMX's (?)\nFor 91' pushing up no daisies\nCause I'm real"}}, {"title": "Give 'Em What They Want", "album": null, "year": null, "lyrics": "Give 'em what they want (c'mon)\nGive 'em what

indeed you I put my trust\nSave me, from all them that persecute me\nAnd deliver me, in Jesus name, GRRRRR\n\nCause we all go anyway, I'mma say goodbye today\nCause it could be any day, I'mma say goodbye today\nWe've grown in so many ways, but I'mma say goodbye today\nCause it could be any day, I'mma say goodbye today-ayayyyy\n\nI'mma say goodbye today, cause I don't know when\nWe gon' cross paths again, until then\nI'mma be that, and see that, speaks the truth\nBelieve that, I'mma see that, to reach the youth\nMy suffering will not be in vain (NOT)\nNeither will yo' pain ever since you passed to hear yo' name\nRest in peace to Autumn - we all know cancer cells kill\nBut if they caught 'em, they could've fought 'em\nIf you'd still be here, right here with us\nWe'd have plenty time before death came to get us\nBUT, what is death like?  Should I really care?\nAfter looking at it, was life really fair?\nDid you burn any bridges?  Did you make amends?\nDid you ask God for forgiveness for your sins?\nWhat is Heaven like?  If you could come back, should you?\nIf you could communicate for a moment there, would you?\n... Just questions that we ask ourselves, every day (wanna know)\n\nCause we all go anyway, I'mma say goodbye today\nCause it could be any day, I'mma say goodbye today\nWe've grown in so many ways, but I'mma say goodbye today\nCause it could be any day, I'mma say goodbye today-ayayyyy\n\nSo young, so gifted\nDirection of life was uplifted, when the wind shifted\nAnd took a turn for the worse, with the blessing come the curse\nA nigga stressing took the dog into the hearse\nMy nigga Divine was way too young to die\nFell out the nest and was way too young to fly\nBut that didn't stop fate from happening\nIdle time make the Devil\u2014HATE WHAT'S HAPPENING!\nGod no!  Why did it go that way?\nComing from his fans away, why did he go that day?\nLightly, I dare say, life goes on\nDonuts, Trey and Jerz I say, please be strong\nHe was supposed to be on the road with me\nI wish somebody WOULD'VE came to get me\nAnd niggas would've had to hit ME\nBut until then, MY FRIEND\nI'mma say goodbye today, cause you never know when\n\nCause we all go anyway, I'mma say goodbye today\nCause it could be any day, I'mma say goodbye today\nWe've grown in so many ways, but I'mma say goodbye today\nCause it could be any day, I'mma say goodbye today-ayayyyy\n\nGoodbye today, I'mma say goodbye today\nGoin away hey (uhh) goodbye today, I'mma say goodbye today\n(It's okay) And I say (let us pray)\nGoodbye today (and I say) say goodbye today\nGo on your way (and I say when you're, gone) I'mma say goodbye today\nI'mma say goodbye today (gotta say before you move on) HEY!\nYes (yeah!)\nI mean, this is life (yeah, say goodbye)\nWe are born, to die, so LET ME FLY!

want more than just a honey wit ass)\n\nUh, uh\nHey yo, who would ever think that the two would go good\nMidtown honey, nigga from the hood\nBut knock on wood, I got this bitch (what?) excuse me\nShe don't like to be called a bitch, try not to lose me\nThe rules we go by, where I'm from, she don't know\nWhen I say I'm goin around the way, she won't go\n(Hell no) C'mon baby, you aight with me\nTryin to get you, to spend the whole night with me\n(But I'm a good girl) Uhh, that's why I like her\nCouldn't treat her like a hoodrat, didn't bite her\nTurn a church girl to a straight Ruff Ryder\nTake her to the Ramada make it an all nighter\n(Oh no, I only go to the Swiss hotel)\nFuckin with me? I have you in the back of the Chevelle\nLike what (what) hittin it raw dogg in the butt\nYou was good this mornin, but tonight you a slut\nChorus: DMX (Dyme)\nWhy do (good girls) like bad guys\nKnowin that bad guys tell mad lies?\n(And why do) dog niggas (want a honey wit class?)\n(Sometimes you want more than just a honey wit ass)\nHey yo Boo, why do (good girls) like bad guys\nKnowin that bad guys tell mad lies?\n(Then why do) dog niggas (want a honey wit class?)\n(Sometimes you want more than just a honey wit ass)\n\nHey yo Boo, I'm diggin you, cause you make me wanna do\nAll them things I was taught I wasn't supposed to\nI'm secure, keep it tight while you on tour\n(You fuckin wit a dog!)

Yo, what you mean? (What to do?\nYou want the nigga wit the slacks, or the jeans and the boots?\nYou wanna be safe or be laced, cause you can be replaced)\nYeah, you can be erased\n(Don't get slapped, babyface)\nChorus\n\nMan, I got shorty stayin out late (Well I keep him wit a cut\nAnd his nails stay clean) At least I get a nut\nAnd I got honey rebellin (And I stopped him from sellin)\nI be gettin away with murder, right?

Pac\nMy niggas gonna hunt you till you drop, believe that\nNiggas is capable of all that, take your mom for ransom\nGive little kids back, that's the way we do things\nNever leave shells, never drop names\nRoll with the game as it change\nJa's to blame, I'ma let this world share my pain\nIn my demise you can put it on my grave\n\"Here lies a lost soul of rage, seen brighter days\nAnd outta darkness done graduated, may he lay\"\nAnd this I swear, here in Hell we don't play fair\nCross the line, with my nine I'll be bringin you here\nMotherfuckers\n\nCheck it out y'all\nCheck it out,

Well take a piece of this ammunition\nAnd get your ass tugged out the Hudson by some old man fishin\nMy mission is almost complete\nThis message will self distruct in two seconds\nBeeeeeeeeeeeeeeep"}}, {"title": "Grand Finale", "album": "Rap Sheet", "year": "1998-10-27", "lyrics": "I ain't goin back to jail\nNext time, the County or the State see me\nIt's gonna be in a bag\nUHH!

that you wanted so bad\nAnd got it then wished it was something you never had\nYou ever been so lost than you thought you won't make it\nIf you ever been forced to do something you couldn't take it\nYou ever felt so strong or so loved\nBut when it came down it wasn't meant to be so hard\nWake yourself up like, where did I go wrong!?\nJust get back up, pray on it and go on\n\nHave you eva been up, ever been down\nEver been lost, then came around\nEver been through it then came outta there\nNever had it, then got a lot of it\nHave you eva been up, ever been down\nEver been lost, then came around\nEver been through it then came outta there\nNever had it, then got a lot of it\n\nEver wanted to go right, then shows left\nHe down with a lift to way shows death\nBurn in the night but everyday shows stress\nRegardless of what you think I'm going in that\nHave you ever wished upon a star that really wasn't there\nGaze so in your heart, but really didn't care\nStand out at the wrong turn and now life ain't fair\nAnd all you can do is take it, like ye\nEver found out that the shit you was living with\nDeeper, cause to me is tryin' to creep ya\nBack your Glock off put your ass in a sleeper\nUsed to be my dog, now he's the Grim Reaper\n\nHave you eva been up, ever been down\nEver been lost, then came around\nEver been through it then came outta there\nNever had it, then got a lot of it\nHave you eva been up, ever been down\nEver been lost, then came around\nEver been through it then came outta there\nNever had it, then got a lot of it\n\nEver seen something that you didn't want to see\nHad to be something that you didn't want to be\nHad to kill a nigga that looked just like me\nWanted to believe to have a trust like me\nI seen the dark, I seen the light\nI seen the day, I seen the night\nI seen the wrong, I seen the right\nI seen the start, I seen the final\n\nHave you eva been up, ever been down\nEver been lost, then came around\nEver been through it then came outta there\nNever had it, then got alot of it\nHave you eva been up, ever been down\nEver been lost, then came around\nEver been through it then came outta there\nNever had it, then got alot of it"}},

mother ready to cry\nThe heat is on (High)\nThe heat is on (You know)\n\nThe heat is on what's my next move\nDo I stick with the score, or get with the door\nFeds got the drop in the back of the Uhaul\nSnipers on the roof chance of getting away too small\nTell'em like this look, it's gonna be a shoot out\nWhoever make it out meet back at the new house good luck\nIf I don't see you again peace\nLet's handle our business with these government police\nYou and you go out the front you take the back\nYou cover the first two and I'll take the sack\nBoomer didn't make it, neither did Stan\nNow it's three niggas, splitin' four hundred grand (aight)\nWe all feel the loss but enjoy the profit\nThe game is the same and nothin gonna stop it\nMost times you make it one time you won't\nAll a nigga could really do is have a vest under the coat (come on)\n(2x)\n\nMe and my two mans gave money twenty grand\nFor a scam they don't get the condo in the sand\nAnd chances of gettin' caught slim next to none\nNow we like three deep need that extra gun\nBump into my man, I remember from up North\nI remember he had principles and wasn't nothin soft\nOff to discuss, just what's going dizzy\nEverybody got it aight let's get busy\nRun up in the bank bitch (woman screams)hit the deck\nYo bust money,and get the keys off his neck (come here)\nWe on the clock, three mintues until we finished\nFeds are on the way, but I'm tryin to see spinach\nIn and out duffle bag across the back\nExtra large sports coat to cover up the mack\nFeds they attack, I spit lead out niggas spread out\nRun up on a civilian in his car, made him get out\n(2x)\n\nHigh speed chasin, racin through the streets\nDeath's in the air, I can taste it through the heat\nMy partner's goin' fast I don't think he's gonna last\nAnd if he don't, I'mma hit his wife with his half\nBut that's the type of nigga I am this ain't just rappin\nI made it, he didn't but ain't shit happens\nWhat can I do, but go on livin'\nFleein' from the condo, I go on a ribbon\nLife goes on, that might sound wrong but heeyyy\nWe all live by the rules of the game we play\nDay to day, death is a possibility\nThe way I play is a vest stops you from killin' me\nIt's too hot to be in the heat cuz it's on\nToo hot to be in the streets so I'm gone\nGo back to being discreet live long\nTil one day, either me or the heat is gone\nCome On!\n(2x)"}}, {"title": "Here We Go Again", "album": "...And Then There Was X", "year": "1999-12-21", "lyrics": "Same old shit dog, just a different day\nYou know how niggas do, when we play, how we play\nIT IS NOT, A FUCKING GAME!\nA man's gotta do what a man's gotta do\nIf it's fuck me nigga, you know it's fuck you\n\nI kick it to shorty to try to help him understand\nHit him with work, cause yo, that's my little man\nHe asked a few questions bout the game and I told him\nSo when he made a bad move it was my place to scold him\nNever told him nuttin wrong, kept it fair\nDidn't listen, so I might as well have been talkin to the air (damn)\nEverybody makes mistakes, a mistake is aight\nBut if it ain't, I'ma tell you straight, time to say goodnight\nNobody likes to be played, regardless of the relationship\nBut shorty's fuckin up big time, I HATE THIS SHIT\nI'm caught in the middle of, havin love for a lil nigga\nKnowin what's expected of me as a, real nigga\nMy next move is crucial, what do I do?\nHow do I keep it real with shorty in my crew?\nDidn't want to kill him, so instead of puttin the Mac on him\nI did the only thing I could do, turn my back on him\n\nHere we go again..\nSame old shit dog, just a different day\nHere we go again..\nYou know how niggas do, when we play, how we play\nHere we go again..\nA man's gotta do what a man's gotta do\nHere we go again..\nSo if it's fuck me nigga, then you know it's fuck you\n\nNiggas that I fuck wit, wanna get him dead\nBut I'm cool with shorty's peoples, so I let him live\nUnder normal circumstances, he would be a marked man\nBut I hit him with a grand, just didn't shake his hand\nGo about your business (uh-huh) do what you gonna do\nBe what you gon' be, I wash my hands, I'm through\nI can forgive I just can't forget\nYou're on your own little man don't ask me for shit\nIf you paid attention to what I taught you then you good\nIf I see you again, get it, understood?\nGo 'head before I change my mind 'cause you know you should be dead\n\"I just wanted to say, \"Aight, go ahead\"\nInstinct told me to kill him but the savior is\nI'm a good nigga, plus I owed his peeps a favor\nBut I also knew, the decision I just made\nWent against the rules of the game that we played\n\nHere we go again..\nSame old shit dog, just a different day\nHere we go again..\nYou know how niggas do, when we play, how we play\nHere we go again..\nA man's gotta do what a man's gotta do\nHere we go again..\nSo if it's fuck me nigga, then you know it's fuck you\n\nI should have, followed my first instinct, cause I knew\nSometimes you gotta do what you gotta do\nNow this nigga's fucking with the competition\nUngrateful motherfucker, should of got him missing\nThis nigga got the nerve, to take my kindness, for a weakness\nGotsta get back on some street shit so I can creep this\nRat, when I act, take one, set him up, to take two\nGet him there, take three, get him done\nWasn't hard for me to get him where I wanted him, confronted him\nBZZZZZZZT, CLICK! There was a bullet in one of them\nFeelin lucky? CLICK, looks like you are\nCLICK CLICK CLICK, luck ain't goin too far\nWhat you did was put on another pair of shoes\nAnd they just happened to be too big\nWhat you did was stupid, real fuckin stupid\nWell shorty I gave you a chance and what did you do?\nThrew it back in my fucking face so fuck you too!\n\nHere we go again..\nSame old shit dog, just a different day\nHere we go again..\nYou

A FUCKING GAME!\nA man's gotta do what a man's gotta do\nIf it's fuck me nigga, you know it's fuck you\n\nI kick it to shorty to try to help him understand\nHit him with work, cause yo, that's my little man\nHe asked a few questions bout the game and I told him\nSo when he made a bad move it was my place to scold him\nNever told him nuttin wrong, kept it fair\nDidn't listen, so I might as well have been talkin to the air (damn)\nEverybody makes mistakes, a mistake is aight\nBut if it ain't, I'ma tell you straight, time to say goodnight\nNobody likes to be played, regardless of the relationship\nBut shorty's fuckin up big time, I HATE THIS SHIT\nI'm caught in the middle of, havin love for a lil nigga\nKnowin what's expected of me as a, real nigga\nMy next move is crucial, what do I do?\nHow do I keep it real with shorty in my crew?\nDidn't want to kill him, so instead of puttin the Mac on him\nI did the only thing I could do, turn my back on him\n\nHere we go again..\nSame old shit dog, just a different day\nHere we go again..\nYou know how niggas do, when we play, how we play\nHere we go again..\nA man's gotta do what a man's gotta do\nHere we go again..\nSo if it's fuck me nigga, then you know it's fuck you\n\nNiggas that I fuck wit, wanna get him dead\nBut I'm cool with shorty's peoples, so I let him live\nUnder normal circumstances, he would be a marked man\nBut I hit him with a grand, just didn't shake his hand\nGo about your business (uh-huh) do what you gonna do\nBe what you gon' be, I wash my hands, I'm through\nI can forgive I just can't forget\nYou're on your own little man don't ask me for shit\nIf you paid attention to what I taught you then you good\nIf I see you again, get it, understood?\nGo 'head before I change my mind 'cause you know you should be dead\n\"I just wanted to say, \"Aight, go ahead\"\nInstinct told me to kill him but the savior is\nI'm a good nigga, plus I owed his peeps a favor\nBut I also knew, the decision I just made\nWent against the rules of the game that we played\n\nHere we go again..\nSame old shit dog, just a different day\nHere we go again..\nYou know how niggas do, when we play, how we play\nHere we go again..\nA man's gotta do what a man's gotta do\nHere we go again..\nSo if it's fuck me nigga, then you know it's fuck you\n\nI should have, followed my first instinct, cause I knew\nSometimes you gotta do what you gotta do\nNow this nigga's fucking with the competition\nUngrateful motherfucker, should of got him missing\nThis nigga got the nerve, to take my kindness, for a weakness\nGotsta get back on some street shit so I can creep this\nRat, when I act, take one, set him up, to take two\nGet him there, take three, get him done\nWasn't hard for me to get him where I wanted him, confronted him\nBZZZZZZZT, CLICK! There was a bullet in one of them\nFeelin lucky? CLICK, looks like you are\nCLICK CLICK CLICK, luck ain't goin too far\nWhat you did was put on another pair of shoes\nAnd they just happened to be too big\nWhat you did was stupid, real fuckin stupid\nWell shorty I gave you a chance and what did you do?\nThrew it back in my fucking face so fuck you too!\n\nHere we go again..\nSame old shit dog, just a different day\nHere we go again..\nYou know how niggas do, when we play, how we play\nHere we go again..\nA man's gotta do what a man's gotta do\nHere we go again..\nSo if it's fuck me nigga, then you know it's fuck you"}}, {"title": "How's It Goin' Down", "album": "It's Dark and Hell is Hot", "year": "1998-05-19", "lyrics": "*Phone rings*\nGuy: Whose dick you sucking?\nGirl: Don't call me with that bullshit, alright?\nGuy: You lying, you lying to me, B\nGirl: Yeah, exactly\nGuy: Whose dick you sucking?

Cuz I keep it realer than you\nYou can't, you can't cuz of all the shit that you do\nYou know, you know just what I'm talkin about\nYou asked, you asked nothin bout runnin your mouth\nA bitch, a bitch

one way\nSunday to Sunday, only game is gunplay\nAnd I know that one day, I'm gon' get it\nUntil I get it, I'm gon' get it\nWe gets it in like a fat bitch cookin'\nLike a nosy bitch that's lookin'\nBeen had the gauge huntin', since the age 11\nNiggas think you on stage, you frontin' - look here\nI'm that nigga, if I knock on your door\nYou gon' look in my eyes and be like, \"Dog, what's wrong?\"\nYou feel it like I feel it, there's somethin' in the air\nWait, c'mere, yeah it's comin' from right there\n\nI, I get scared, I get scared, when you're gone\nBut I know I'm gonna be

me real, so why pretend\nMake a nigga take it back to where it all began\nI mean, even we went, yeah it's that bad\nDon't let me catch you slippin', yeah I'm that mad\nWhen the Dog do when there's no cats to chase\nI'm sure there's somethin' else and try to take off his face\nYeah you was in the wrong place, at the wrong time\nI'm takin' everything you got, I want it, all mine\nHow a nigga gon' stop me when, I don't stop for signs\nYeah you got mine, but don't start lyin'\nUnderstand a nigga tryin', but don't stop it from happenin'\nBut I guess they won't GET IT, until I start clappin'"}},

With two platinum albums?\nNaw dog, I started off on the block\nI just did shit to get shit\nNiggas always knew I was down to hit shit\nThat's why I stay wit shit\nPlayed with shit, but it wasn't a game\nFirst time locked down, wasn't the same\nA whole new world, nothin but close to steel\nNiggas gettin split for real, miss a good deal\nThey ain't call nobody, cuz don't nobody care\nThey got my

dogs and recording\nAccording to the man upstairs, we all got our own problems\nSo you, stop worryin about theirs\nI'm long time ago, look awake, cuz he'll leave you\nI hear none, speak none, see none, evil\nAll I can do is teach you, what I know\nHow I flow, how I get down, where I go\nMaybe what I been through, will send you\nSomewhere, other then where, dreams all out the window\nI love my

step by step\nAnd we create our own path, until there's no life left\nI hold my death, off for as long as I can\nKnowin my man, is plottin with the chrome in his hand\nSupposed to be fam, but niggas get shady over money\nMy nigga, pull out the 380 over money\nCrazy over money, can't do without it\nI got other shit to deal with, I'm like forget about it\nIt's the one I don't know but must teach that comes first\nBecause he comes with the thirst of a nigga that tatted the worst\nIt's like a curse that's to be lifted, he was there but he gripped it\nGot a call and he shifted, once he found out he was gifted\nGotta kick it from the heart, and I hope you got it\nIt was there from the start, I just hope you spot it\nCuz it's my blood on paper, my soul on paper\nWords to live by will leave a

can, pave my way\nHave I been forgotten, have I forsaken\nOr maybe I'm just wrong with the moves that I've been makin\nHatin others cuz they hate me, over envy\nWanna send me, when we used to be friendly\nThink I started off on top? With two platinum albums?\nNaw dog, I started off on the block\nI just did shit to get shit\nNiggas always knew I was down to hit shit\nThat's why I stay wit shit\nPlayed with shit, but it wasn't a game\nFirst time locked down, wasn't the same\nA whole new world, nothin but close to steel\nNiggas gettin split for real, miss a good deal\nThey ain't call nobody, cuz don't nobody care\nThey got my back against the wall, fuck it I'm just here\n\nFirst I'm gonna crawl\nThen I'm gonna walk\nThen I'm gonna stand\nThen I'm gonna talk\nWhat I gotta learn?\nIn order to teach\nThen I gotta burn\nIn order to reach, (my nigga)\n\nDog it's like this, when the fog is type thick\nA nigga might flip, and a nigga bite quick\nBut I stay focused on what's important\nSupportin my family, fuckin with my dogs and recording\nAccording to the man upstairs, we all got our own problems\nSo you, stop worryin about theirs\nI'm long time ago, look awake, cuz he'll leave you\nI hear none, speak none, see none, evil\nAll I can do is teach you, what I know\nHow I flow, how I get down, where I go\nMaybe what I been through, will send you\nSomewhere, other then where, dreams all out the window\nI love my people, all of my people\nAnd God gon keep me callin my people\nYou gots to live life to the fullest\nIt ain't always about the size of the gun, sometimes it's the bullet\n\nFirst I'm gonna crawl\nThen I'm gonna walk\nThen I'm gonna stand\nThen I'm gonna talk\nWhat I gotta learn?\nIn order to teach\nThen I gotta burn\nIn order to reach, (my nigga)\n\nEvery day we live and learn, take it step by step\nAnd we create our own path, until there's no life left\nI hold my death, off for as long as I can\nKnowin my man, is plottin with the chrome in his hand\nSupposed to be fam, but niggas get shady over money\nMy nigga, pull out the 380 over money\nCrazy over money, can't do without it\nI got other shit to deal with, I'm like forget about it\nIt's the one I don't know but must teach that comes first\nBecause he comes with the thirst of a nigga that tatted the worst\nIt's like a curse that's to be lifted, he was there but he gripped it\nGot a call and he shifted, once he found out he was gifted\nGotta kick it from the heart, and I hope you got it\nIt was there from the start, I just hope you spot it\nCuz it's my blood on paper, my soul on paper\nWords to live by will leave a hole in the paper\n\nFirst I'm gonna crawl\nThen I'm gonna walk\nThen I'm gonna stand\nThen I'm gonna talk\nWhat I gotta learn?\nIn order to teach\nThen I gotta burn\nIn order to reach, (my nigga)"}}, {"title": "I'm Gonna Start This", "album": "Live At Woodstock", "year": "1999-01-01", "lyrics": "Oh oh, what have they done now?\nI want everybody who can see me, to put ya motherfuckin Xs in the air!\nGrrr...

name\nMary Ella Holloway, why you gotta be so far away?\nUsed to say, \"Don't worry, it's gon' be okay\"\nBut it ain't \u2013 it's like when you left, you took the Lord with you\nWhy couldn't I come when He came to get you?\nDamn, I really miss you\u2026 I had to say it again\nI remember the time when I was like 10\nCrept up in the neighbor's yard, yeah, bein' hard headed\nYou told me I would get it \u2013 you said it!\nAnd boy did I get it, but after you spanked me, you hugged me\nKissed me on my forehead, told me that you love me\nAnd I saw that it hurt you more than it hurt me\nI thought, how bad could this hurt be?\nI know now, that's why it's only done out of love\nWhat I wouldn't give for one mo' hug, from grandma\n\nBaby, it's gon' be okay (She used to tell me that\u2026)\nBaby,

destroyed\nYet from this body, I will see God\nYes, I will see Him for myself\nAnd I long for that moment\n\nGrandma, I really miss you, and it ain't been the same\nI drop a tear when I hear your name\nMary Ella Holloway, why you gotta be so far away?\nUsed to say, \"Don't worry, it's gon' be okay\"\nBut it ain't \u2013 it's like when you left, you took the Lord with you\nWhy couldn't I come when He came to get you?\nDamn, I really miss you\u2026 I had to say it again\nI remember the time when I was like 10\nCrept up in the neighbor's yard, yeah, bein' hard headed\nYou told me I would get it \u2013 you said it!\nAnd boy did I get it, but after you spanked me, you hugged me\nKissed me on my forehead, told me that you love me\nAnd I saw that it hurt you more than it hurt me\nI thought, how bad could this hurt be?\nI know now, that's why it's only done out of love\nWhat I wouldn't give for one mo' hug, from grandma\n\nBaby, it's gon' be okay (She used to tell me that\u2026)\nBaby, it's gon' be okay (I really miss hearin'\u2026)\nBaby, it's gon' be okay (She used to tell me that\u2026)\nBaby, it's gon' be okay (I really miss hearin'\u2026)\n\nWhat I'm about to say a couple of family members is gon' hate me\nBut I'mma let you know what's been goin' on lately\nNow you know since you left a lot of things with your kids done changed\nYeah, Jackie's still crazy, don't know what's up with James\nAin't seen Jerry in a while, you know he walk like you\nAnd Ren\u00e9e's back in jail, you know she talk like you\nRiculah's(?) doing real good now, she workin'\nRhonda's still runnin' around, trickin', jerkin'\nBuckeye's buggin', he done lost his mind\nAnd Jarvis? Back out of jail, doin' fine\nKylie? He done changed, it ain't all about self\nAs for my father... well, that's somethin' else\nBut that's my dog, he hold his grandmother down\nMy great grandmother, makin' a lot of trips out of town\nBut that's a good thing, and if I could only hear you sing\nOnce more, oh Lord, the comfort it would bring\n\nBaby, it's gon' be okay (She used to tell me that\u2026)\nBaby, it's gon' be okay (I really miss hearin'\u2026)\nBaby, it's gon' be okay (She used to tell me that\u2026)\nBaby, it's gon' be okay (I really miss hearin'\u2026)\n\nYou left behind a mother, eleven kids, eleven grand-kids\nAnd since then, two of your grand-kids done had kids\nThey had a boy named Tacoma, Xavier's brother\nThat's right, Xavier's made you a great-grandmother\nI thank you for the best times of my life\nI thank you for when you first met her acceptin' and lovin' my wife\nI thank you for those Sunday dinners, they were vital\nI thank you for my life, I thank you for the Bible\nI thank you for the songs that you'd sing in the mornin'\n(Amazing Grace\u2026) while I'm yawnin'\nI thank you for the two beatin's you gave me\n\u2018Cause I know somewhere along the line the lesson I learned from the two beatin's saved me\nAnd when you died I cried like a baby, I begged the Lord to take me\n\u2018Cause no one else could give me what you gave me\nBut life, like everything, comes to an end\nI pray I go to Heaven to see you again \u2013 Amen\n\nBaby, it's gon' be okay (She used to tell me that\u2026)\nBaby, it's gon' be okay (I really miss hearin'\u2026)\nBaby, it's gon' be okay (She used to tell me that\u2026)\nBaby, it's gon' be okay (I really miss hearin'\u2026)\nBaby, it's gon' be okay (She used to tell me that\u2026)\nBaby, it's gon' be okay (I really miss hearin'\u2026)\nBaby, it's gon' be okay (She used to tell me that\u2026)\nBaby, it's gon' be okay (I really miss hearin'\u2026)\n\nAmazing Grace, how sweet the sound\nThat saved a wretch like me\nI once was lost, but now I'm found\nWas blind, but now I see, yeah"}}, {"title": "Industry", "album": "Def Poetry Jam", "year": null, "lyrics": "Yea, (another gutter...) you know we had to do it this time baby!

Oh, you don't know what the gun do?\nSome do, those that know are real quiet\nWhen you think you wanna try it, fuck around and start a riot\nNiggas gonna buy it, regardless\nBecause I'm the hardest rap artist and I'mma start this\nShit up for real, get up and feel\nMy words, I make herbs split up and squeal\nIll is all I've been hearing lately\nNiggas hate me, wanna duct tape me and make me\nPut their brains on the wall, when I brawl\nToo late for that 9-1-1 call\nNiggas stay beefing, but a lot of them bluff\nBut not me because I'm a nigga that can get out of them cuffs\nYou think a lot of them's tough, that's just a front\nWhen I hit them niggas like 'What you want?' The battle turns into a hunt\nWith the dog right behind niggas chasing them down\nWe all knew that you was pussy, but I'm tasting it now\nAnd never give a dog blood, because raw blood will have a dog like what\nBiting whatever, all up in your gut\nGive it to them raw like that, and ain't no love I do 'em all like that\nFour right up in they back; clack-clack\nClose your eyes baby, it's over, forget it\nHappened in front off your building, but nobody knows who did it\n\nWhat\nWhere my dogs at?\nWhat what\nWhere my dogs at?\nUh\nWhere my dogs at?\nWhat what\nWhere my dogs at?\nUh\nWhere my

left him like that, laying up with the white hat\nGetting right back atchya when I snatch ya\nUp out the grave, nothing but bones and ashes\nHittin' niggas with gashes to the head\nStraight to the white meat but the street stays red\nGirls gave me head for free cause they see\nWho I'ma be, by like 2003\nThat Nigga D took it there, he thought it was a joke\nHe went through like 20 G's and thought that I was broke\nStupid, that's what you get for thinking\nAnd eventually found that's what you get for stinking\nBlowing up the spot when you rot\nPlus, if it gets hot, they know you dead

BUGGIN\nI've done it all - from mackin two hoes on a three-way\nDominican hoes on B-way, country hoes in V-A\nAnd they all say the same about my game it's tight\nThat's why every night a different group of bitches start a fight\nOver some dick that they don't even own\nAll I'm givin them is the bone\nBlowin up a niggas phone, but ain't nobody home (damn)\nI'm in the zone, tryin to do things\nLet's turn this into a crew thing -- whassup girlfriend, you game?\nDon't wonder why when I leave at night\nIt's because I thieve at night\nI'm leavin bitches not breathin right\nI fuck they head up with some slick shit\nHit em off with some long dick shit\nMake it some quick shit, but rip shit\nThen I'm out, just like the trash on a Thursday\nKnowin she'd be givin up the ass on the first date\nChorus 2X\n\nFlocks of bitches by the dozens, from sisters to cousins\nGot em doin shit they said they wasn't ever gonna do\nLike knowin I'd fuck the bitch that she was close to\nStill gave up the ass and dough, she was supposed to (what?)\nPictures of bitches and flicks of chicks\nVideos with the baddest hoes, suckin dick\nIt's the dog in me, that makes me do wrong\nAnd honies can't help but get strung (why?)\nCause the game is too strong (okay)\nI like em greedy, black like Edi\nEyes beady, willin to give to the needy\nI done ran through em all, from around the way bitches\nTo them outta state hoes, and even hittin gay bitches\nAll I tell em is, \"Let me get that,\" then it's on\nKnock her motherfuckin boots, and then I'm gone\nI got the white bitches sayin, \"It's a black thing!\"\nCause I leave that ho with no dough and plenty of back pain\nChorus 2X\n\nBitches who get props, cause they know who can get got\nAnd they can get shot, by the way a niggas lip drop\nWalk up in the spot, knowin what she want strictly\nWhen hon wants the dickly, hon comes and gets me\nHits me, pays me, doesn't get crazy\nKnows to be Swayze, cause that's daddy's baby\nI keep them hoes in check, like the government\nHittin em off with nuttin BUT THE DICK, and they lovin it!\nHuggin it, like it's they best friend, cause it is\nWord to Miz, fuckin with tricks is just biz\nI deal with

but where's my bitches?\nI love my niggas, but where's my bitches?\nChorus: DMX\nIt's all good, it's alright\nFuck all day, fuck all night\nCall my bitches, cause wherever I go, y'all my bitches\nEast to the West coast, all my bitches\n\nYo\nChickens is good for pluckin so I'm stickin bitches fuckin\nGot em trickin while they suckin, give em dick and they be BUGGIN\nI've done it all - from mackin two hoes on a three-way\nDominican hoes on B-way, country hoes in V-A\nAnd they all say the same about my game it's tight\nThat's why every night a different group of bitches start a fight\nOver some dick that they don't even own\nAll I'm givin them is the bone\nBlowin up a niggas phone, but ain't nobody home (damn)\nI'm in the zone, tryin to do things\nLet's turn this into a crew thing -- whassup girlfriend, you game?\nDon't wonder why when I leave at night\nIt's because I thieve at night\nI'm leavin bitches not breathin right\nI fuck they head up with some slick shit\nHit em off with some long dick shit\nMake it some quick shit, but rip shit\nThen I'm out, just like the trash on a Thursday\nKnowin she'd be givin up the ass on the first date\nChorus 2X\n\nFlocks of bitches by the dozens, from sisters to cousins\nGot em doin shit they said they wasn't ever gonna do\nLike knowin I'd fuck the bitch that she was close to\nStill gave up the ass and dough, she was supposed to (what?)\nPictures of bitches and flicks of chicks\nVideos with the baddest hoes, suckin dick\nIt's the dog in me, that makes me do wrong\nAnd honies can't help but get strung (why?)\nCause the game is too strong (okay)\nI like em greedy, black like Edi\nEyes beady, willin to give to the needy\nI done ran through em all, from around the way bitches\nTo them outta state hoes, and even hittin gay bitches\nAll I tell em is, \"Let me get that,\" then it's on\nKnock her motherfuckin boots, and then I'm gone\nI got the white bitches sayin, \"It's a black thing!\"\nCause I leave that ho with no dough and plenty of back pain\nChorus 2X\n\nBitches who get props, cause they know who can get got\nAnd they can get shot, by the way a niggas lip drop\nWalk up in the spot, knowin what she want strictly\nWhen hon wants the dickly, hon comes and gets me\nHits me, pays me, doesn't get crazy\nKnows to be Swayze, cause that's daddy's baby\nI keep them hoes in check, like the government\nHittin em off with nuttin BUT THE DICK, and they lovin it!\nHuggin it, like it's they best friend, cause it is\nWord to Miz, fuckin with tricks is just biz\nI deal with strictly dimes\nGot em committin they first crimes\nNow she suckin dick, for the first time\nAnd ain't no secret, bout how I freak it, when they sleep\nDidn't never know how I peeped it, then creeped it\nThat's how I know this must be that shit\nI tell them bitches, \"I'll be back,\" and they believe that shit!\nChorus 4X\n\nI love my niggas, but where's my bitches?

truck\nCause that mean i'll drop a chump when i cock and dump\nWeather its Glock or pump,cats ain't ready\nHalf from here to here looking like spaghetti\nPull out the machette right off the lims\nBag

ready to start this war that's for sure\nNigga come and get it\nRide and die why\nCause my niggas is wit it\nI want Monopoly money but I ain't even halfway there\nCause do a dirt and a nigga got to take the back way there\nWhat it is is the biz and it's dirty\nYou'll get rich but life expectancy is about thirty\nTake the business to the hallways, driving up for four days\nOn parole with warrants that'll send me back the raw way\nIf I get caught across Jersey state lines\nFigure this 98 and I been runnin since 89\nSo that's like 9 years delinquent time\nYou speak in crime then you know\n9 years you owe, get knocked- 9 years you gonna go\nNo probation or parole more time doin' nothin'\nDay room to the yard writin rhymes an frontin\nCarry niggas greasy because I'm built like that\nBurry niggas easy cause they get kilt like that\nIf you ain't in it wit me than you in my way\nBut either or you will respect mine\nAnd leave tech 9 and leave it for dude\nThe realest you gonna feel is when you face your death\nSorry I didn't know nigga don't even waste your breath\nCoppin pleas not D why you flippin\nNigga know the only thing I'm really scared of is slippin\nLettin a nigga catch you when I got my guard down\nSo I keep 'em up\nNoddin' off with one eye open\nI can freak it but there's gonna be a time when I'm close 'em both\nLead poisonin I'm a get hit with an overdose\nOver those drug things, crud things\nThink I don't know my slug stains, or blood blaze\nRaw gun playin drama\nSadness to another niggas momma\nI'mma be the the one that puts you up inside the trauma\nThese are troublesome times\nAnd the crime prevails\nAnd the dark side keep a nigga's ass in jail\nBada-boom-bada-bing some of this and some of that\nI gotta boogie for a minute but you know I'm coming back\nChorus(2x)\nTry to show niggas but I can only hope they see\nYou's a little nigga fit right up in a 6 by 3\nLayin' up like this\nLips sewn shut eyes closed\nNiggas walk past the casket damn shorty nice pose\nYou was ballin nigga till your ass got balled out\nCalled out by some disrespectful ass niggas that go all out\nI bet you thought it was real funny\nUntil it had to get cruddy\nMe walkin off leavin' you with all this bloody\nWhat he gonna do when it's all over for real\nAnd the last thing you seein' is that steel\nA blast of light that's what he seein' if you blast him right\nHit him in his face and hear them close the casket tight\nCause it's like it ain't nothin but endin it to a nigga\nStreet sweeper like ahhhh!\nSendin it to a nigga\nWhen you in the house you'll play by house rules\n2 words you'll never hear again are house lose\nAnd that's house choose it ain't gonna be that\nCause I can't see that\nReady to get up in this nigga's ass real good so where the weed at\nBelieve that you ain't going to see nothin' gettin' too familiar\nI would tell you what I'll do but than I'd have to kill you\nAnd it ain't even worth it I ain't goin to build nothin\nSo I'm just gonna let you go be that same nigga\nStill frontin laughin and shit\nLike you see somethin' funny\nWhat you sayin' sounds good\nBut let me see somethin money\nFor real\n(dog nigga, dog nigga, dog nigga, dog nigga nigga)\nChorus(4x)", "image": "https://images.genius.com/236ac8cb125196c489579b947c3b2fb8.945x945x1.jpg", "artist": "DMX", "raw": {"annotation_count": 8, "api_path": "/songs/17476",

ready to start this war that's for sure\nNigga come and get it\nRide and die why\nCause my niggas is wit it\nI want Monopoly money but I ain't even halfway there\nCause do a dirt and a nigga got to take the back way there\nWhat it is is the biz and it's dirty\nYou'll get rich but life expectancy is about thirty\nTake the business to the hallways, driving up for four days\nOn parole with warrants that'll send me back the raw way\nIf I get caught across Jersey state lines\nFigure this 98 and I been runnin since 89\nSo that's like 9 years delinquent time\nYou speak in crime then you know\n9 years you owe, get knocked- 9 years you gonna go\nNo probation or parole more time doin' nothin'\nDay room to the yard writin rhymes an frontin\nCarry niggas greasy because I'm built like that\nBurry niggas easy cause they get kilt like that\nIf you ain't in it wit me than you in my way\nBut either or you will respect mine\nAnd leave tech 9 and leave it for dude\nThe realest you gonna feel is when you face your death\nSorry I didn't know nigga don't even waste your breath\nCoppin pleas not D why you flippin\nNigga know the only thing I'm really scared of is slippin\nLettin a nigga catch you when I got my guard down\nSo I keep 'em up\nNoddin' off with one eye open\nI can freak it but there's gonna be a time when I'm close 'em both\nLead poisonin I'm a get hit with an overdose\nOver those drug things, crud things\nThink I don't know my slug stains, or blood blaze\nRaw gun playin drama\nSadness to another niggas momma\nI'mma be the the one that puts you up inside the trauma\nThese are troublesome times\nAnd the crime prevails\nAnd the dark side keep a nigga's ass in jail\nBada-boom-bada-bing some of this and some of that\nI gotta boogie for a minute but you know I'm coming back\nChorus(2x)\nTry to show niggas but I can only hope they see\nYou's a little nigga fit right up in a 6 by 3\nLayin' up like this\nLips sewn shut eyes closed\nNiggas walk past the casket damn shorty nice pose\nYou was ballin nigga till your ass got balled out\nCalled out by some disrespectful ass niggas that go all out\nI bet you thought it was real funny\nUntil it had to get cruddy\nMe walkin off leavin' you with all this bloody\nWhat he gonna do when it's all over for real\nAnd the last thing you seein' is that steel\nA blast of light that's what he seein' if you blast him right\nHit him in his face and hear them close the casket tight\nCause it's like it ain't nothin but endin it to a nigga\nStreet sweeper like ahhhh!\nSendin it to a nigga\nWhen you in the house you'll play by house rules\n2 words you'll never hear again are house lose\nAnd that's house choose it ain't gonna be that\nCause I can't see that\nReady to get up in this nigga's ass real good so where the weed at\nBelieve that you ain't going to see nothin' gettin' too familiar\nI would tell you what I'll do but than I'd have to kill you\nAnd it ain't even worth it I ain't goin to build nothin\nSo I'm just gonna let you go be that same nigga\nStill frontin laughin and shit\nLike you see somethin' funny\nWhat you sayin' sounds good\nBut let me see somethin money\nFor real\n(dog nigga, dog nigga, dog nigga, dog nigga nigga)\nChorus(4x)"}}, {"title": "King Thing", "album": "Never Die Alone Soundtrack", "year": null, "lyrics": "AUWW\nGGRRRRRRRRR\nUh\nYou know\n(dmx barking)\nAin't about being a

time they do it to me\n\nI gotta make it out and move quickly\nCan't allow the past to restrict me\nBet this time around they won't skip me\nI am the last hope, (The Champ!)\nWon't hesitate not even for a second\nThe hustle has become an obsession\nI'm on the frontlines with my weapon\nI am the last hope\n\nDamn, I went through it again\nAfter telling everybody I wouldn't do it again\nI kinda feel like I let my people down (yup)\nBut to get them right, I got's to pick myself up (come on)\nWhen I heard this beat and hook, it was so raw (uhh)\nLooked in the mirror, didn't like what I saw, (uhh)\nAll I could say was: ahh man shit gotta change (forreal!)\nEither get it right or take one to the brain (blam!)\nBut y'all know the pain that I went through daily, (woooh)\nTryna stay sane through the rain, y'all hear me\nI'm slippin', fallin', can't get up\nBut this time I'm outta control, I don't give a fuck!\nFor the thugs!, I'm the last hope for the team (come on!)\nI'm the reason why some niggas, gotta hope and a dream (come on!)\nThese cats know what's good, I am the hood (Aii)\nI ain't hoping that they don't, I wish a nigga would (come on!)\n\n\nI gotts to do it for me, or do it for them, (yeah)\nI ain't playing with this shit, Im'ma do it to win\nKnow I can do it again, (come on) cause I did it before\nWith little to no effort, and y'all niggas knew the score (for real)\nFirst album dropped in May, second in December\nOver platinum in one year like, y'all don't remember, (come on)\nOnly nigga who's first 5 albums debuted at number 1\nAnd you wonder why I call you son (my son)\nI just begun, to get started, with the hardest part of it all\nIs to climb a slippery wall and, still don't fall\nBreak down and call up to God, when it gets to hard\nI know you ain't gonn' let me go now!!(please) You brought me too far\nShowed me I was as a star, all my life\nI know it, all it right, before I, call it a night\nI'mma thank you for it all, the blessings and the curses\nAnd I hope you listening, there's a lesson in the verses\nYeah\n\n\nDoes it bother me?\nYeah off course it bothers me\nCause it's not who I am, I'm not you know, the person the media portrays me to be, ya mean?"}}, {"title": "Last Hope Skit", "album": "The Weigh In", "year": "2012-01-01", "lyrics": "Long-time boxing veteran\nHe is the former heavyweight champion of the

purpose of a lesson\nThat will hopefully turn out to be a blessing\nNo second guessing\nLet me be an example of how strong this love is\nAnd to never put anything above his, 'cause what if\nIt wasn't unconditional, then what whould we do\nIf he did how we do\nWe know we wouldn't supose to do the things\nThat we did but we did 'em\nAnd if that wasn't bad enough then we hit 'em\nBut you saw it all, So we only ly to ourselfes\nHelp us, save us from hell\nLet me be!\nLet me be your angel, let me be the one for you\nLet me be your angel, let me be the one... (let me be, let me be, let me see!)\nYou believe in\nI ask a lot of questions, 'cause I need a lot of answers\nSometimes I think I need to ask the questions faster\nSurrounded by confusion, am I winning or losing?\nIs it because the lifestyle that I'm choosing?\nUps and downs, Right from wrongs\nGoods from bads, Rob out the ghetto all the good I had\nStill I grab, opportunity and ran with it\nAnd a brother still can't get it, man quit it\nAll lives have already been written\nThere's no need for asking'\nDon't mess with the fruit thats forbidden\nWe know god loves us, but don't test faith\nBecause woulda coulda shoulda are all to late!\nLet me be your angel, let me be the one for you\nLet me be your angel, let me be the one...\nYou believe in\nSo many nights I felt alone\nWithout a friend I want to call on\nUnlike the rain would never end\nUntill you came and found a friend\nAnd through my ups and my downs\nI have someone to stick around\nYour the reason I keep believing!\nLet me be your angel, let me be the one for you\nLet me be your angel, let me be the one...\nYou believe in\nLet me be your angel, let me be the one for you\nLet me be your angel, let me be the

blessing\nNo second guessing\nLet me be an example of how strong this love is\nAnd to never put anything above his, 'cause what if\nIt wasn't unconditional, then what whould we do\nIf he did how we do\nWe know we wouldn't supose to do the things\nThat we did but we did 'em\nAnd if that wasn't bad enough then we hit 'em\nBut you saw it all, So we only ly to ourselfes\nHelp us, save us from hell\nLet me be!\nLet me be your angel, let me be the one for you\nLet me be your angel, let me be the one...

Here it is, eat it!\nAnother song completed is another thought captured\nLet me do my thing, I got it locked with this rap shit\n\nEither let me fly or give me death\nLet my soul rest, take my

breath\nIf I don't fly I'ma die anyway\nI'ma live on, but I'll be gone any day\nEither let me fly or give me death\nLet my soul rest, take my breath\nIf I don't fly I'ma die anyway\nI'ma live on, but I'll be gone any day\n\nHold me down, niggas wanna know me now\nDidn't want to play with me when to show me how\nNo meow, 'cause it's all about the bark\nLet the dog loose, baby, it's about to spark\nLight up the night like the 4th of July\nNiggas know, when I let go, niggas die\nWith this Y and you don't know, you slow\nLike Baltimore, if you ain't tryin' to go you blow\nI soak up all the pain and accept it in silence\nWhen I let go it's violence, 'cause the wildest\nIs the dog barkin' up the tree for the cat\nIn the fog, what y'all niggas see is the bat\nFlappin' away, but I'm blind like Stevie\nNiggas don't hear me, still tryin' to see me\nStop bein' greedy, you heard what I said\nLet me go, let me flow, or I'm dead\n\nEither let me fly or give me death\nLet my soul rest, take my breath\nIf I don't fly I'ma die anyway\nI'ma live on, but I'll be gone any day\nEither let me fly or give me death\nLet my soul rest, take my breath\nIf I don't fly I'ma die anyway\nI'ma live on, but I'll be gone any day\n\nI sold my soul to the Devil, and the price was cheap\nAyo, it's cold on this level, 'cause it's twice as deep\nBut you don't hear me, ignorance is bliss and so on\nSometimes it's better to be thought dumb \u2013 shall I go on?\nYo, on the real, what the deal? It's a mystery\nHow is it I can live and make history?\nIf you don't see it, then it wasn't meant for you to see\nIf you wasn't born with it, it wasn't meant for you to be\nBut you can't blame me for not wantin' to be held\nLocked down in a cell where a soul can't dwell\nThis is hell, go get the Devil and give me the key\nBut it can't be worse than the curse that was given to me\nIt's what I live for, you take away that and I'm gone\nThere's a difference between doin' wrong and bein' wrong\nAnd that ain't right, just keep it fair, baby\nPut me in the air and I'll take it there, baby \u2013 yes!\n\nEither let me fly or give me death\nLet my soul rest, take my breath\nIf I don't fly I'ma die anyway\nI'ma live on, but I'll be gone any day\nEither let me fly or give me death\nLet my soul rest, take my breath\nIf I don't fly I'ma die anyway\nI'ma live on, but I'll be gone any day\n\nI'ma flow regardless because I'm an artist until I'm trapped\nI'ma continue to hit the hardest whether I scrap or rap\nGive me dap, but you ain't my friend\nI see it in your eyes, you contemplate my end\nYou waitin' for that bend in the road where you were told\nThat you would go when you were old and if you died young it was cold\nSold, not for nearly what it was worth\nThink back 26 years, be like, \"What if his birth\nWas a miscarriage and I never existed?\"\nHave I given somethin' that if taken away you'd have missed it?\nDidn't know, yet I persisted, it was the call of the wild\nI merely say what's in my heart and you call it a style\nDon't put it in a cage, don't mistreat it\nYou say you hunger for knowledge? Here it is, eat it!\nAnother song completed is another thought captured\nLet me do my thing, I got it locked with this rap shit\n\nEither let me fly or give me death\nLet my soul rest, take my breath\nIf I don't fly I'ma die anyway\nI'ma live on, but I'll be gone any day\nEither let me fly or give me death\nLet my soul rest, take my breath\nIf I don't fly I'ma die anyway\nI'ma live on, but I'll be gone any day\n\nOr give me death\nOr take my breath\nI'ma die anyway\nBut I'll be gone any day\nOr give me death\nOr take my breath\nI'ma die anyway\nBut I'll be gone any day\nWhere my niggas?\nUh, ahh, for my niggas\nUh, ahh, for my niggas\nUh, ahh, for my niggas"}}, {"title": "Let's Get Crazy", "album": null, "year": null, "lyrics": "(feat.

In contrast, carbon dioxide is almost entirely transported extracellularly dissolved in plasma as bicarbonate ion\nVertebrate blood is bright red when its hemoglobin is oxygenated\nSome animals, such as crustaceans and mollusks, use hemocyanin to carry oxygen\nInstead of hemoglobin\nInsects and some mollusks use a fluid called hemolymph instead of blood\nThe difference being that hemolymph is not contained in a closed circulatory system\n\n\nIn most insects, this \"blood\" does not contain oxygen-carrying\nMolecules such as hemoglobin because their bodies\nAre small enough for their tracheal system to suffice for supplying oxygen\nJawed vertebrates have an adaptive immune system\nBased largely on white blood cells\nWhite blood cells help to resist infections and parasites\nPlatelets are important in the clotting of blood\nArthropods, using hemolymph, have hemocytes as part of their immune system\n\n\nBlood is circulated around the body through blood vessels\nBy the pumping action of the heart\nIn animals with lungs, arterial blood carries oxygen\nFrom inhaled air to the tissues of the body\nAnd venous blood carries carbon dioxide\nA waste product of metabolism produced by cells\nFrom the tissues to the lungs to be exhaled\nMedical terms related to blood often begin with hemo- or hemato-\n(also spelled haemo- and haemato-) from the Greek word \u03b1\u1f37\u03bc\u03b1 (haima)\nFor \"blood\". In terms of anatomy and histology\nBlood is considered a specialized form of connective tissue\nGiven its origin in the bones\nAnd the presence of potential molecular fibers in the form of fibrinogen\n\n\nDue to its importance to life\nBlood is associated with a large number of beliefs\nOne of the most basic is the use of blood as a symbol\nFor family relationships through birth/parentage\nTo be \"related by blood\" is to be related by ancestry or descendance\nRather than marriage\nThis bears closely to bloodlines\nAnd sayings such as \"blood is thicker than water\"\nAnd \"bad blood\", as well as \"Blood brother\"\nBlood is given particular emphasis in the Jewish and Christian religions\nBecause Leviticus 17:11 says \"the life of a creature is in the blood.\"\nThis phrase is part of the Levitical law forbidding the drinking of blood\nOr eating meat with the blood still intact instead of being poured off\nMythic references to blood can sometimes\nBe connected to the life-giving nature of blood\nSeen in such events as childbirth, as contrasted with the blood of injury or death\nIhave often noticed that\nAncestors never boast\nThe descendants who boast\nOf ancestors\nI would rather start a family than one blood will tell but often it tells too much\nDance mehitabel dance\nCaper and shake a leg\nWhat little blood is left\nWill fizz like wine in a keg\nBlood is a specialized bodily fluid that delivers necessary substances to the body's cells (in animals) \u2013 such as nutrients and oxygen\nAnd transports waste products away from those same cells", "image": "https://images.genius.com/1bcf43b1cc0f34db6cd70e1a63c8b84c.464x464x1.jpg", "artist": "DMX", "raw": {"annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/518480", "description":

which constitutes 55% of blood fluid, is mostly water (92% by volume)\nAnd contains dissipated proteins, glucose, mineral ions, hormones, carbon dioxide\n(plasma being the main medium for excretory product transportation), and blood cells themselves\nAlbumin is the main protein in plasma, and it functions to regulate the colloidal osmotic pressure of blood\nThe blood cells are mainly red blood cells\n(also called RBCs or erythrocytes)\nAnd white blood cells, including leukocytes and platelets\nThe most abundant cells in vertebrate blood are red blood cells\nThese contain hemoglobin, an iron-containing protein\nWhich facilitates transportation of oxygen by reversibly binding to this respiratory gas and greatly increasing its solubility in blood. In contrast, carbon dioxide is almost entirely transported extracellularly dissolved in plasma as bicarbonate ion\nVertebrate blood is bright red when its hemoglobin is oxygenated\nSome animals, such as crustaceans and mollusks, use hemocyanin to carry oxygen\nInstead of hemoglobin\nInsects and some mollusks use a fluid called hemolymph instead of blood\nThe difference being that hemolymph is not contained in a closed circulatory system\n\n\nIn most insects, this \"blood\" does not contain oxygen-carrying\nMolecules such as hemoglobin because their bodies\nAre small enough for their tracheal system to suffice for supplying oxygen\nJawed vertebrates have an adaptive immune system\nBased largely on white blood cells\nWhite blood cells help to resist infections and parasites\nPlatelets are important in the clotting of blood\nArthropods, using hemolymph, have hemocytes as part of their immune system\n\n\nBlood is circulated around the body through blood vessels\nBy the pumping action of the heart\nIn animals with lungs, arterial blood carries oxygen\nFrom inhaled air to the tissues of the body\nAnd venous blood carries carbon dioxide\nA waste product of metabolism produced by cells\nFrom the tissues to the lungs to be exhaled\nMedical terms related to blood often begin with hemo- or hemato-\n(also spelled haemo- and haemato-) from the Greek word \u03b1\u1f37\u03bc\u03b1 (haima)\nFor \"blood\". In terms of anatomy and histology\nBlood is considered a specialized form of connective tissue\nGiven its origin in the bones\nAnd the presence of potential molecular fibers in the form of fibrinogen\n\n\nDue to its importance to life\nBlood is associated with a large number of beliefs\nOne of the most basic is the use of blood as a symbol\nFor family relationships through birth/parentage\nTo be \"related by blood\" is to be related by ancestry or descendance\nRather than marriage\nThis bears closely to bloodlines\nAnd sayings such as \"blood is thicker than water\"\nAnd \"bad blood\", as well as \"Blood brother\"\nBlood is given particular emphasis in the Jewish and Christian religions\nBecause Leviticus 17:11 says \"the life of a creature is in the blood.\"\nThis phrase is part of the Levitical law forbidding the drinking of blood\nOr eating meat with the blood still intact instead of being poured off\nMythic references to blood can sometimes\nBe connected to the life-giving nature of blood\nSeen in such events as childbirth, as contrasted with the blood of injury or death\nIhave often noticed that\nAncestors never boast\nThe descendants who boast\nOf ancestors\nI would rather start a family than one blood will tell but often it tells too much\nDance mehitabel dance\nCaper and shake a leg\nWhat little blood is left\nWill fizz like wine in a keg\nBlood is a specialized bodily fluid that delivers necessary substances to the body's cells (in animals) \u2013 such as nutrients and oxygen\nAnd transports waste products away from those same cells"}}, {"title": "Life Be My Song", "album": "Year of the Dog...

gave it all to me\nAnd in the process, I lost my soul\nDamn! the devil got a hold\nIn my mind, I'm like a little boy\nLost in crime\nLike the healthy nigga that the devil forced into dying\nThe lord knows I'm trying\nBut at the same time\nYou hear the nigga with the weight of the world!\nWhy you gave it to Earl?\n\nI'm gonna go hard\nWhether I'm right or wrong\nTill the dead and gone\nIt's on!\nWhat ya'll really want?!\nBring it on\nI'mma let life be my song\nTo live is to suffer\nAnd I'm living it up\nFace everyday chin up\nI ain't giving it up\nCause if I ain't giving a fuck\nThe who will?!\nSo I hope for the best\nKnowing that its all uphill\nSometimes I wonder what's lifes about\nSometimes I wonder why I take the wrong route\nThen turn around and go out\nAnd no doubt, the fate in mine is blind\nSo whatever, fuck it, I'mma roll out\nWe all go through the motions\nWe get different notions\nWe each have our own ocean\nThat we can either drown or float\nLike the vessels that we are\nVessels that would carry many far\nDont know what to say, when you talking\nDont know who you gone see, when you walking\nIf you dont know how much of what you do is dirt\n3 things you dont know gonna get you hurt!\nNigga!\n\nI'm gonna go hard\nWhether I'm right or wrong\nTill the dead and gone\nIt's on!\nWhat ya'll really want?!\nBring it on\nI'mma let life be my song"}}, {"title": "Lil

that wanna murder me\nJust because they've heard of me, and they know that the Dark is for real\nThe bark is for real, (arf) when you see that spark it'll kill\nPeep how I park it and chill, take it over there, bark wit' it\nFrom Y.O. to Cali to Baltimore back to New York wit' it\nCome through flyin', up 1-2-9\nUp the School Street 'cause I come through mine\nBark at my dogs, \"Get at me, nigga!\"\n\"Arf! Arf! Arf! Get at me, nigga!\"\nWhat the deal is? Never forget what real is\nThem cats that used to say \"X is the best,\" know he still is\nCan't help but feel this, puttin' goosebumps on your arms\nTake you there if you want but I lose chumps with the bomb\nIt's the calm before the storm\nDr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde and it's gettin' warm, feel me yo\n\nLook through my eyes and see what I see\nDo as I do, be what I be\nWalk in my shoes and hurt your feet\nThen know why I do dirt in the street\nLook through my eyes and see what I see\nDo as I do, be what I be\nWalk in my shoes and hurt your feet\nThen know why I do dirt in the street\n\nI can understand why y'all niggas is scared of me\nAnd why the big dogs never wanted to play fair with me\n'Cause I leave blood wherever I go, wherever I flow\nWherever I blow niggas who know I can go, feel me yo\nWhat is it about the Dark that gets niggas where they about to spark\nAbout to bark, take it to the heart 'cause it's real like that\nGive him chills, but do I make him feel like that\nShit is real, what you don't know is gon' get ya\nWith the steel, what you don't know is gon' split ya\nI can blaze tracks, make niggas play wax and raise stacks\nPayback's a bitch; didn't you used to say that?\nPlay around in dirt, you'll get mud\n'Cause you know, I can either spread love or shed blood\nAnd bloodshed turns the mud red and real sticky\nOr I can hit you from roof, make it a quicky\nFor real\n\nLook through my eyes and see what I see\nDo as I do, be what I be\nWalk in my shoes and hurt your feet\nThen know why I do dirt in the street\nLook through my eyes and see what I see\nDo as I do, be what I be\nWalk in my shoes and hurt your feet\nThen know why I do dirt in the street\n\nI bear my soul, niggas wouldn't dare, my role\nGives a nigga a heart of gold, but with a hole\nLost all control, my shoulders hold a lot of weight\nJust like first time sold an eighth, then told it's not an eighth\nBut then it's out of state, and it's too late for changes to be made\nThat's what I get for fuckin' with strangers in the shade\nThis is it, y'all niggas got to give me a plate\nFor the same reason that fate chose to give me the weight\nTake away hate, now I'm supposed to love the one that cursed me\nThe one that wouldn't give me a cup of water when I was thirsty\nIt was always him versus me, but now I gotta teach him\nPersonal feelin's put aside, 'cause now I gotta reach him\nWhat I'd like to do is turn my head, like I don't know him\nBut it seems like I've been called on to show him, so I'ma show him\nAnd if you never met me, then you've no right to judge me\nI've got a good heart but this heart can get ugly\n\nLook through my eyes and see what I see\nDo as I do, be what I be\nWalk in my shoes and hurt your feet\nThen know why I do dirt in the street\nLook through my eyes and see what I see\nDo as I do, be what I be\nWalk in my shoes and hurt your feet\nThen know why I do dirt in the street\n\nFeel the pain, feel the joy, of a man who was never a boy\nFor real\nArf arf, arf arf arf"}}, {"title": "Lord Give Me a Sign", "album": "Year of the Dog...

every turn that rise against my judgment, thou shall condemn\"\n(Lord give me a sign)\nFor this is the heritage of the servants of the Lord\n\"And their righteousness is of me,\" said the Lord\nAmen, Lord, give me a sign!\n\nI really need talk to you, Lord\nSince the last time we talked the walk has been hard\nNow I know you haven't left me, but I feel like I'm alone\nI'm a big boy now, but I'm still not grown\nAnd I'm still going through it, pain and the hurt\nSoaking up trouble like rain in the dirt\nAnd I know only I can stop the rain with just the mention of my savior's name, in the name of Jesus\nDevil, I rebuke you, for what I go through\nBeen trying to make me do what I used to\nBut all that stops right here\nAs long as the Lord's in my life I will have no fear\nI will know no pain from the light to the dark\nI will no show no shame, spit it right from the heart\nCause it's right from the start, you held me down\nAnd ain't nothing they can tell me now. Lord, give me a sign!\n\nLet me know what's on your mind\nLet me know what I'm gon' find\nIt's all in time, show me how to teach the mind\nShow me how to reach the blind. Lord, give me a sign!\nShow me what I gotsta do to bring me closer to you\nCause I'ma go through whatever you want me to\nJust let me know what to do. Lord, give me a sign!\n\nPlease, show me somethin'\nI'm tired of talking to him, knowing he frontin'\nCrying about, \"Life ain't nothin\", but you either be the one mad cause you trapped or the one huntin'\nTrapped in your own mind, waiting on the Lord\nOr hunting with the word that cuts like a sword\nThe spoken word is stronger than the strongest man\nCarries the whole world like the strongest hand\nThrough the trials and tribulations, you never let us down\nJesus, I know you're here with us now\nJesus, I know you're still with us now\nKeep it real with us now, I wanna feel, show me how\nLet me take your hand, guide me\nI'll walk slow, but stay right beside me\nDevil's trying to find me\nHide me! Hold up, I take that back\nProtect me and give me the strength to fight back\nLord, give me a sign\nLet me know what's on your mind\nLet me know what I'm gon' find\nIt's all in time, show me how to teach the mind\nShow me how to reach the blind. Lord, give me a sign!\nShow me what I gotsta do to bring me closer to you\nCause I'ma go through whatever you want me to\nJust let me know what to do. Lord, give me a sign!\n\nLife or death, live or die\nI will never live a lie\nI'm going there because I try\nI won't give in till I die\nI'm gon' make it, wrong or right\nMake it through the darkest night\nWhen the morning comes you'll see\nAll I have is God in me\nLord give me a sign!\nPlease\nLord give me a sign!\nLord give me a sign!\n\n\nLet me know what's on your mind\nLet me know what I'm gon' find\nIt's all in time, show me how to teach the mind\nShow me how to reach the blind.

block and make it boom {*BOOM*}\nI take the car and hit it with this boom\nNow come on, let's get that money!\n\nIt's two o'clock and I'm just about to hit the street\nTil I knock off this rock I don't get to eat\nSometimes that's like that's the only reason why I hustle\nStep on toes, strongarm and show a lil' muscle\nAin't no real dough, that's why a nigga feel so frustrated\nI hate it, seein crab niggas that made it\nAnd I'm robbin cats just as broke as myself\nLivin foul and ain't lookin out for my health, where's the wealth?\nNot in New York, cause niggas talk about goin out of state\nMoney got an eighth, comin back, hot with a lot of weight\nWhere's my plate nigga? I'm hungry too\nSo I'mma do like hungry do, and get a hungry crew\nNiggas that ain't never had, and doin bad\nWill be glad to get up off that stoop lookin' sad\nGrab your bags, it's about to go down\nWe goin to this hicktown, let's get the lowdown, on how they get down\nChorus 2X\n\nI gots to make a move and make it soon\nGots to take a block and make it boom\nWe comin through so make some room\nFound somethin that could be somethin if I pump it up\nThis kid Black is the only thing that could fuck it up\nThe purple top thirty-five smalls is ringin' bells\nBut I'mma crush him with the black 40 double-L's\nI send two niggas back up top, and come back\nWe chop up rock, by midnight, we open up shop\nIt's four in the mornin, we on the block creepin\nKillin the cash, while yo' ass is sleepin\nLook here, I'm what they call a true hustler\nCause, nigga, if I ain't know you since I was like six\nThen I don't trust ya\nAnd we'll bust ya over somethin petty like a few dollars\nPut somethin hot up in that ass and watch you holla (\"Ahhhhh!\")\nYou think I'm here for the ho flow? I want the dough flow\nAnd fuck the po'-po', nigga keep a fo'-fo'\nChorus 2X\n\nI spend my money on niggas cause niggas get me rich\nAnd a bitch ain't doin shit but suckin my dick\nNiggas is family now, and we stand strong\nThirty niggas on six blocks, makin the cash long\nShit is good, because niggas gettin what they been wantin\nAnd we see the same shit, other New York niggas frontin\nStick up kids huntin, but I ain't got no love for em\nI keep the burner and the duster with the glove for em\nThem motherfuckin knockers come at us and chop us\nAnd I know they, really tryin to stop us and wanna drop us\nSo we pump, from the alley and the last house we use as a cash house\nIt's holdin em strong, it's a stash house\nI got runners that work for twelve hour shifts\nAnd when them niggas keep they count correct, I don't riff\nBut I ain't tryin to hear that nigga took your pack shit\nAin't tryin to hear jack shit, fuck the black bitch\nI ain't a greedy nigga, all I want is a five year run\nIf I don't make it, then fuck it, let me die near a gun\nGot bitches to transport without an escort\nI'm makin moves from D.C. up to Westport\nLocal police ain't a problem cause they don't even stress us\nIt be them ATF niggas that have you under pressure\nJust so you know, ain't gon' never put my Glock down (why nigga?)\nCause I'm a hustlin motherfucker, and I'm holdin my block down\nChorus 2X"}}, {"title": "Mary J.

came - from\nThe motherfucking slum\nYou remind me of when you was a bum\nCrazy dumb - getting hit in the hallway\nBuilding 5 - I heard you take it all ways\nIn the ass and especially the mouth\nYou get on the radio and now you're from down south, the Bronx, or Brooklyn\nAnywhere but from ???\nSure you know the place that you left your mom...\nI'm from the motherfucking Y-O\nWhere the niggas is real and the bitches act like they know\nYou fuckin ho, you know I know\nCause my mutherfucking man Nas told me so\nSo did Little Jo, Big Coup and Derrick\nWash from School Street and can't forget Eric\nAin't you tired of getting hit with dicks\nYou even fucked my man Charles Oakley from the Knicks\nYou shouldn't use sex to get away from ???\nYou got niggas trooping to Fordham Road\nJust to drop a load\nBitch you shouldn't have hoe'd\nEverybody got your code\nThe pussy is sold - and your ass and face\nBut I asked my man and he said it wasn't all that\nRight about the time you were shopping the demo\nHe tore your ass up in the back of a limo\nAnd you didn't even care\nYou left your mom in ??? - on what WELFARE\nBitch you know you ain't right\nMatter fact what are you doing at about 8 o'clock tonight\nYou got the boots and I'm coming to get 'em\nIs it true that after you fuck 'em, you'll make a record with him\nIf so then I'll be there and it won't be hard to find me\nCause

huh, it's Murda\nMotha f**kers wanna kill me but don't got the heart\nTo look me in the eyes with the nine and spark\nCause whether your for or against this\nWhen I spit with murderous intentions, everybody goes everybody knows\nThe weapons I possess they not for show\nAnd you put dresses on your weapons when you walk out the door\nSee once I flash mother f**kers better do the one shot dash\nOr be one shot ass\nJ to the A-Y to the drive by to your hood screamin bye-bye to you\nWhy would you f**k with me\nKnowing I put you six feet deep and them niggas could die wit'cha\nCock the hot pistol and pop the hot Cristal\nAnd promise you only one thing, to not miss you\nJahova know the god that served ya\nCause dead or alive when I arrive it's Murda\nShit I hope ya'll niggas know to lay low now\nCause thou shall perish if you don't bow down\nCause I hit em on sight, its dark dim the lights\nYou shot twice god bless to this the night\nThat alot of niggas fear the coming of their life\nAnd you dead right be in hell looking for ice\nF**kin with Ja you bitch niggas talking shit\nAll on my dick you broke niggas making me rich\nYou gonna blaze me cause you high ripped off the henne rock\nFlow semi-hot handling me your not\nCheck my forte not even on a bad day you beat this\nRather beat your dick or your bitch\nMy flow be the sick shit, gravely ill\nNiggas dying cause they know I spit like iron, nothing but bark flyin\nFlows and mics, hell and night, go together like heaven and light\nNiggas ain't seein my plight, It's alright\nI let the world know I shine like ice\nI bet it all I can throw a hard four in the dice\nCause I'm a gambling man, you should gamble with a gat in your hand\nSpin in barrel and put it to your head\nCause we don't dance no more all we do is cock and spit\nDedicated to giving you nothing but thug shit\nThink we playing, you undoubtable fall further\nF**kin with I N C is Murda\nI'm a cruddy nigga, goin' up raw-dog in dirty bitches\nAnd if I get burnt, I'm givin that shit to thirty bitches\nYou say you know a nigga like me, guess again Poppy\nI might smile up in your face but I ain't your friend Poppy\nJump out the fifteen hundred like runnin, niggas don't want it\nGet it, Done it, when I'm blunted\nHowever it went down, I made it happen, I made it scrapin'\nI made it fussin, bustin, I made it cappin\nAnd lettin off wasn't nothing new to a nigga\nSomething to do to a nigga, Cause you is a fool nigga\nI know your type, you hype, all up off that fake shit\nYou can't understand why a man would have to take shit\nOr steal shit, but this is that real, niggas kill shit, peel shit\nI hit you in your head you won't feel shit!!!\nURRUURRRR.....\nLet the dogs lose on a niggas ass\nFind out if the niggas faster then the trigger's blast\nA f**king snake in the truest form\nKnowin' damn well that what I do is wrong, but still I do it strong\nNiggas is making movies so i gots to stop production\nI need a block to function and maybe I'll stop destructin\nThese blocks are not for frontin', So let me get that shorty\nCause you don't need that shorty\nYou don't know what to do with that shorty\nYou might as well hit this 40, before you hit the floor\nAnother 24, What you want, Money, More!?!\nThem niggas did it raw, with no condom\nYou find em, sayin sorry he for what he said before I blind them\nGet the flame out the four fifth, and there ain't gonna be no more riff\nDog you want a floss tiff, but would of made it to the door if\nBullets travled alot slower, and you ran alot faster\nBut they don't and you can't so don't think about after\nCause tomorrow ain't comin, so stop runnin\nCause you gonna die like a sucker\nMurder Motherf**ker!!!\nUh!, where my mother f**king dogs at, Uh, Uh\nMy nigga Jigga, My dog Ja, Irv Gotti, Rough Riders, Def Jam\nWhere my dogs at, Top Fight Uh, Where my dogs at\nHold me down baby, Hold me down baby, Hold me down baby\nBoomer One Love Nigga, URRUURRRR, Murda Motherf**ker.."}},

the black shotty\nBitch-ass niggas who act snotty\nGet it\nThese niggas is for real\nThese niggas ain't playin\nThis ain't no fuckin game\nYou think we playin?\nRuff Ryders\nGrrrrrr"}}, {"title": "Next Out the Kennel", "album": "The Great Depression", "year": "2001-10-23", "lyrics": "Aiyyo, this is DJ Kay Slay from around the way\nAnd my dog DMX is puttin it down with the Bloodline family\nAnd the Bloodline kennels\nTHE GREAT DEPRESSION! FOURTH TIME!\nX keeps it gutta and his dogs are no different\nYou gotta respect the line...\nFirst out the kennel, Jynx reppin straight from Y.O. kennel\nHoldin it down...\n\nLet it be known, bring it to me\nBreak the fingers that you write with\nMouth that you recite with, real life shit\nNiggas call me God on beats, cuz I light shit\nQuicker than those, shootin big holes, rippin your clothes\nPlay games and have a thug nigga sittin at your home\nSee you walkin with that bitch when he spit at yo dome\nDamn, ya brains all over the place!\nBitch cryin and screamin, cuz ya brain's all over her face!\nI got love for street thugs and killers, with deep mugs\nWho bust they guns first then they start to cuss\nShook niggas hold they guns till they start to rust\nBitch niggas don't want no parts of us, we dangerous\nTripped a few times off of angel dust\nOne shot turn yo brains to slush\nYeah, niggas don't learn shit till the lights is off...\nIt's too late! Now your life is lost, motherfucker!\n\n\nDAMN! See what I'm sayin, this shit is real\nNext out the kennel, barkin from Dirty Jerz is that nigga Loose\n\nLet me Loose, nigga! Get the fuck off me!\nI can't believe my ears! Huh? These niggas is barely on!\nIn fact they wack, they just got a hot song!\nFuckin up the game is catz like you\nThat make wack niggas think they can rap too!\nBut Loose at the door now, so come with me\nI'mma make sure no more rappers like you get in!\nYou want it? We can go hard with the beats\nOr hard to the body or hard to the teeth\nYeah, I was on Universal, they couldn't have me\nThey kept me on the hush, like Whitney drug habit!\nGot drafted, then made it to the front line\nA year later, got traded to Bloodline\nNow it's hard for catz to keep they spot\nHe rock too much ice, he can't keep it hot\nAnd when all the ice melt, they all watered down\nLoose, fuck that, the streets is mines now!\n\n\nFIRE! Only stray kills, yaknowhatimsayin?\nNext out the kennel, my nigga Big Stan from Harlem\nGet at em dog...\n\nUh-oh, who's next? That would be me, BS, ya know?\nUh, y'all niggas ain't ready, uh\nI'm like a thieve in the night, I creep in your life\nOne day when you nice, high off the henny\nCatch you while you partyin right\nWith the semi, put your body on ice, for a price\nMake a bastard of your son as well as widow your wife\nMy struggle was tight, love inside my heart has limits\nLike anything outside of Bloodline, bound to get it\nWe bound to win it, niggas want, we bound to give it\nAnd anything you catz start, you know we bound to finish\nCan you see the cage is open? Muzzle is off\nThe nine is sick, the silencer will muffle the cough\nThe Line is thick, Stan stay solo on cost\nMy shoulder will frost on any nigga other than dog\nI'm the one ya moms would hate you to cross\nIf you the only child, would be replacing the lost\nPlease think before you go against the B dot S\nAnd no it's not a game, I'm one of Bloodline's best, nigga...\n\n\nWhoa, whoa, whoa, they just keep bitin\nThe last to bite, that bitch, the bitch of the litter\nCrazy Kash, Kashmir, get at em girl...\n\nWhat the fuck ya niggas know about grease?\nI got enough to put in ya piece, plus bust ten in ya fleece\nMake ya back bend in a crease, that's what you get offend a beast\nYou hatin me like I was a friend of Kelis\nLoad, cock back and release\nBad bitch crackin ya piece, bullet holes in the back of your peeps\nAlways catch niggas comin from the back with the heat\nLove to watch they knees buckle when they smack the concrete\nYou ain't gotta love me, just respect the bitch!\nScared to fight me, get your girls, so I can wet the bitch!\nWho gives a FUCK who ya old lady be?\nI put holes in ya old lady tee if she fuckin with me!\nYou know my niggas Stan, Jynx, Loose, Berg and X\nYa niggas switchin occupations, cuz they heard we next\nNo niggas above mine, cuz no niggas above mine\nAnd that shit's in my heart, cuz it's in my fuckin Bloodline...", "image":

the back\nTrust you to stuck one in your mouth\nSoon as I walk out\nTrust you to steal from me, lie to me\nActing like we love each other why do we?\nEverything about you is crooked, look it\nFed a nigga some bullshit , and I took it\nThat's what I get, an old school fucking with a hybrid\nMost of you talk about \"try it\"\nFool me once, shame on you\nFool me twice, did what you supposed to do\nAin't never even thought about biting the hand that feeds me\nGood job motherfucker, it's greedy\nIf I can't fuck with you for real I can't fuck with you at all\nThat means y'all, but when you get caught up don't even call\nDon't worry about me cause I'm gonna ball\nIf I can't fuck with you for real I can't fuck with you at all\nThat means y'all, but when you get caught up don't even call\nDon't worry about me cause I'm gonna ball", "image": "https://images.genius.com/5e36caac869327ad8b5a01792f569aac.500x500x1.jpg", "artist": "DMX", "raw": {"annotation_count": 3, "api_path":

But now the only two relative questions\nIs \"Do we bury him or burn? Any suggestions?\"\nEither way, you up out of here for good\nNow when niggas mention your name they knockin on wood\nDid I, get my, point across?\nAnother body on the shottie another joint I toss\n\n+ everytime, cause we don't play..\nEverytime, cause we don't play..\n\nIt ain't no sunshine when the Dark Man comes out\nAnd I want mine, so I plan to keep my gun out\nWe got four 9's, so niggas run in and run out\nBut I bust mine, cause I'd like to hear some shouts\nGet at me dog, niggas know how its goin dizzy\nWhen it comes to that flow, I gets busy\nWho is he?

fight\nBut ya niggas be playin'\nThinkin' it's alright keep playin' with that road\nAnd you gonna know the night\nWhen you layin' in that cold\nDirt gettin' tossed in your grave\nNow it's all over\nPreacher said you was brave\nBut now it's all over\nYou just one of the many, plenty I done gave it to\nAin't no savin' you\nNo matter how many tears your mom's cried\nAin't gon bring your ass back, plus in hell, you gon fry\nWhy? But now the only 2 relative questions is\nDo we bury him or burn? Any suggestions?\nEither way, you up out of here for good\nNow when niggas mention you name\nThey knockin' on wood, did I get my point across?\nAnother body on the shotte, another joint I toss\nAin't no sunshine when it's on\nOnly darkness every day\nAin't no sunshine when it's on\n'Cause when it's on, ya niggas gonna be gone\nEvery time 'cause we don't play\nAin't no sunshine when it's on\nOnly darkness every day\nAin't no sunshine when it's on\n'Cause when it's on, ya niggas gonna be gone\nEvery time 'cause we don't play\nAin't no sunshine when it's on\nOnly darkness every day\nAin't no sunshine when it's on\n'Cause when it's on, ya niggas gonna be gone\nEvery time 'cause we don't play\nAin't no sunshine when it's on\nOnly darkness every day\nAin't no sunshine when it's on\n'Cause when it's on, ya niggas gonna be gone\nEvery time 'cause we don't play\nThere ain't no sunshine\nWhen the Dark Man comes out\nAnd I want mine so I plan to keep my gun out\nWe got four 9's so niggas run in and run out\nBut I bust mine 'cause I'd like to hear some shots\nGet at me dog, niggas know how it's goin' dizzy\nWhen it comes to that flow, I gets busy\nWho is he? Dark Man of the unknown\nOne dog, one bone\nNow who ain't goin' home? Looks like you\nYou hear strike 1, talkin' shit, strike 2\nWon't be a strike 3 'cause I don't play fair\nI'ma look you in your eye while he hit you from the rear\nBe like, yeah, holdin' you up 'cause you fallin'\nThe Lord ain't comin' till niggas stop callin'\nYou was ballin' a minute ago in it for dough\nTill it was, \u00e2\u20ac\u00bdYo, I swear to God, I didn't know\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\nAin't no

know\nWhatchu think you gon get?\nFuck around with my dough\nJust so it ain't no mistakes, this is my show\nOne\n(One)\nTwo\n(Two)\nThree\n(Three)\nHere I go\nYour shit is quick and your shit is sleek\nBut this shit is thick and when you hear this shit\nDamn right I can finish shit\nIf you caught that verse without a rewind you can see mine\nBut you be blind, I'll do it 360, come up from behind\nTap you on the shoulder, have you turnin' around\nHit you with somethin' that I'll have you burin' the ground\nBe like, \"Damn, ain't nothin' left of money but a pile of ash\"\nLife is good so please enjoy it while it lasts\n'Cause you know ain't got much longer to go\nThe quicker you go depends the stronger the flow\nWhen niggas know I don't give a fuck, right or wrong\nThere ain't no sunshine when it's on"}}, {"title": "Nothin' Move But The Money", "album": "The 24th Letter", "year": "2001-01-01", "lyrics": "Since we gots to rob something its definitely gonna be worth it\nInside

ATF, who the fuck is he?\nDog is the nigga that's gon' walk through the night\nPark the car twenty blocks away and walk to the fight (WHAT?!)\nAnd go where the fuck I want cause New York is alright\nThe dog is alright, if the hawk is on sight\nEverything from \"Get at Me Dog\" to \"What's My Name?\" (woo!)\nX got a rep, niggas trust my name\nAin't never been a nigga to discuss my fame (WHAT?!)\nFuck my fame, nigga, what's my name? (WHAT?!)\nI'mma keep it real no, matter what it cost me\nNever one to be taken lightly or softly\nDog, I don't know you please back the fuck up off me\nBefore I have him, cause I popped you tryin to off me\n\nSo don't walk too fast or talk too much\nCause y'all niggas is ass, and you know whassup\nCause y'all niggas'll blast and we like WHAT?!\nAnd my niggas'll blast and Y'ALL FUCKED UP!\n\nI done told you niggas to walk with me, and stand\nNow who's lookin at me, akwardly? My man\nBut you know who I let talk to me? My fans\nTake pictures shake hands cause, that's my man\nIt'll be what it is for as long as I let it last\nShit niggas put out? I'd be wrong if I let it past\nThink that shit is hot bitch, just because you said it fast? (WHAT?!)\nI'm about to dead it fast, you pumped off unleaded gas (c'mon!)\nDon't keep goin where you're goin it's a dead end\n'fore a nigga catch you at the door tryin to get it\nKey tryin to fit in, fo'-pound spittin\nGet what you put in (WHAT?!) bullshit forbidden (WHAT?!)\nStop talkin wreckless, cause - y'all don't mean it (woo!)\nY'all better respect this, cause - y'all don't seen it (woo!)\nY'all better check this cause I'm gon' bring it\nBring it? I don't think y'all really wanna see it!\n\n\nAiyyo why do niggas run they mouth, when they ain't bout it? (uh-huh)\nAin't \"Ryde or Die\" but, stay wantin to shout it (uh-huh)\nStay pullin the thing out but what you gon' do without it?\nNo, I wanna know f'real, what you gon' do without it? (f'real!)\nWe done tested y'all niggas, the rest of y'all niggas\nThreatened y'all niggas, STRAIGHT UP, double vested y'all niggas\nAnd it was ONLY out of love that we protect y'all niggas\nAnd because of a nigga in jail, we respected y'all niggas\nBut\n - 1/2\n\nBe careful where you walkin cause the ground's real shaky\nNigga hold the fo' but PLEASE don't make me\nPlease don't mistake me,

on the mile got two sails\nOn the alley it was pincking and kinking\nNiggas know the hack, come and make no decision\nSame thing, and never knock out or locked out\nMoney was kinda big so I ball it so and sock it out\nThen I'm up quick and up in the ceil\nLocked 'em and get 'em motherfucker to tell\nSee they know that nigga respect and know my style\nBalling all wide get to big and to wild\nPut and know that I try to do what I gotta do\nAnd so I ain't scheming on you\nOn an on, on an ok, the game don't stop, it goes on and on\nOn an on, on an ok, the game don't stop, it goes on and on\nOn an on, on an ok, the game don't stop, it goes on and on\nFirst got knocked off, coming to the ball yeah\nThen nigga burning it up by hobby and ball hit\nAnd never nigga try to hit yeah\nAnd he pick us up\nAnd that won't be the nigga, that the doctors did this up\nYou know a nigga thirsty when you set but I'm not really looking for something\nI just wanna do my job\nFucks e up, we gonna do a creature now\nAlmost see that after taking shelter\nBut so bitches that I use to fuck with this \nIf I gotta have all on my mind, do this in time and get it of \nHold up, I got my army white here\nPut 'em all and got all tend on my side\nKnow what happens next is on us\nOn an on, on an ok, the game don't stop, it goes on and on\nOn an on, on an ok, the game don't stop, it goes on and on\nOn an on, on an ok, the game don't stop, it goes on and on\nTimes up, I'm playing the game, watching the club\nI'm on way out, chain 'em my soke and \nBack on the block, seeing a lot of new faces\nI will need more money, for met some new places\nI give a nigga with every day on trust\nAnd if you don't wanna get involve you better past me\nBumping to a nigga, I remember from up top\nLooking on the cloud fuck what's up\nAnd hell yeah watch the  we both fuck, money got to be a hit\nA crack nigga so I pull it up and seak up\nShould I smack and put ball or smack and \nYou say you got the hole block and it's burning\nI pray 'em like I bang myself\nTake it from a real nigga how's role is ball\nGame don't stop it goes on and on\nOn an on, on an ok, the game don't stop, it goes on and on\nOn an on, on an ok, the game don't stop, it goes on and on\nOn an on, on an ok, the game don't stop, don't stop, don't stop, don't stop"}}, {"title": "One More Night", "album": "Redemption of the Beast", "year":

know he here somewhere\nSee, money get high, I don't knock what a nigga do to get by\nJust make sure you gettin' by don't fuck with you gettin' mine\nAin't the first time he ran off, shoulda split his shit then\nHate to think of what he's did and if I catch him slippin'\nWon't be an ass-whippin, I can tell you that\nI keep it real with this cat, he go and sell two packs\nAnd run off (damn) tell me he was locked down up North\nAnd you out a week later?

We got a hero, shoot that nigga!\nMatter of fact, you hit the back, I'll put two in that nigga\nHard-head motherfuckas always get it\nI told him what would happen if he moved\nThat nigga moved so I did it\n\"Did you get it?\" I asked my man as he was comin' from the back\nNigga opened his mouth, said nothin' and fell out flat\nThis cat come out spittin', hittin' my mans, his mans\nCouldn't control what was in his hands\nI'm hit, damn!

make\n\nAyo I see it, try to avoid it, but it comes\nThat's how it's goin' in the slums over crumbs\nSomethin' little becomes somethin' major\nNiggas gettin' blown up like a pager, ear to ear with the razor\nPour out my soul, took control of hurt\nWhy must Earl Simmons swim in dirt?\nI'm gon' make it work, 28 and tryna get baptized\nPriest scared to touch me 'cause he said I gave him bad

when you touch the shovel\nThe level of animosity is stoppin' me from thrivin'\nFuck what them niggas is talkin' about, I'm survivin'\nAlive and goin' through it, but I made my bed\nSo now it's in

to you hungry and tired, you give me food and let me sleep\nI come to you weak, you give me strength and that's deep\nYou call me a sheep and lead me to green pastures\nOnly askin' that I keep the focus in between the chapters\nYou give me the word and only ask that I interpret\nAnd give me the eyes that I may recognize the serpent\nYou know I ain't perfect, but you'd like me to try\nUnlike the devil who just wants me to lie, 'til I die\nLord, why is it that I go through so much pain?\nAll I saw was black, all I felt was rain\nI come to you because it's you who knows\nYou showed me that everything was black because my eyes were closed\nYou gave me the light and let me bask in your glory\nSo it was only right that when you ask for this story\nI put it together to do our dogs some good\nOur dogs bein' brothers and sisters in the hood\nPlenty of times you sent help my way, but I hid\nAnd I remember once you held me close, but I slid\nThere was somethin' that I just had to see\nThat you wanted me to see so I can be what you wanted me to be\nAnd I think I've seen it, 'cause I don't feel the same\nMatter of fact, I know I've seen it, I can feel the change\nAnd it's strange, almost got me beatin' down your door\nBut I've never known a love like this before\nIt's a wonderful feelin' to get away from the pain\nAnd up under the ceilin' I get away from the rain\nAnd the strain that I feel when I'm here is gone\nI know real, so I wipe away the tears; it's on\nAnd I almost lost faith when you took my man\nMonty, Paso, and Jay's brother Dan\nAnd I fear that what I'm sayin' won't be heard until I'm gone\nBut it's all good, 'cause I really didn't expect to live long\nSo if it takes for me to suffer, for my brother to see the light\nGive me pain 'til I die, but please, Lord, treat him right"}}, {"title": "Prayer III", "album": "...And Then There Was X", "year": "1999-12-21", "lyrics": "Let us pray\nLord Jesus it is you who wakes me up every day\nAnd I am forever grateful for your love, this is why I pray\nYou let me touch so many people, and it's all for the good\nI influenced so many children, I never thought that I would\nAnd I couldn't take credit for the love they get\nBecause it all comes from you Lord; I'm just the one that's givin' it\nAnd when it seems like the pressure gets to be too much\nI take time out and pray, and ask that you be my crutch\nLord I am not perfect by a longshot, I confess to you daily\nBut I work harder everyday, and I hope that you hear me\nIn my heart I mean well, but if you'll help me to grow\nThen what I have in my heart, will begin to show\nAnd when I get goin', I'm not lookin' back for nothin'\n'Cause I will know where I'm headed, and I'm so tired of the sufferin'\nI stand before you, a weakened version of your reflection\nBeggin' for direction, for my soul needs resurrection\nI don't deserve what you've given me, but you never took it from me\nBecause I am grateful, and I use it, and I do not worship money\nIf what you want from me is to bring your children to you\nMy regret is only havin' one life to do it, instead of two\nAmen", "image":

this is why I pray\nYou let me touch so many people, and it's all for the good\nI influenced so many children, I never thought that I would\nAnd I couldn't take credit for the love they get\nBecause it all comes from you Lord; I'm just the one that's givin' it\nAnd when it seems like the pressure gets to be too much\nI take time out and pray, and ask that you be my crutch\nLord I am not perfect by a longshot, I confess to you daily\nBut I work harder everyday, and I hope that you hear me\nIn my heart I mean well, but if you'll help me to grow\nThen what I have in my heart, will begin to show\nAnd when I get goin', I'm not lookin' back for nothin'\n'Cause I will know where I'm headed, and I'm so tired of the sufferin'\nI stand before you, a weakened version of your reflection\nBeggin' for direction, for my soul needs resurrection\nI don't deserve what you've given me, but you never took it from me\nBecause I am grateful, and I use it, and I do not worship money\nIf what you want from me is to bring your children to you\nMy regret is only havin' one life to do it, instead of two\nAmen"}}, {"title": "Prayer (Intro)", "album": "Mixtape", "year": null, "lyrics": "In the name of

heart\nAnd I know it\u2019s just a start, for there is more to come\nSo now I embrace it when I used to run\nDidn\u2019t know what I was running from or running towards\nUntil one day I saw it; I was running from the Lord\nAnd when I came back you accepted me with open arms and said \"All is forgiven.\"\nAnd I became so strong that I could fight off the devil with just spoken words\nSay it, \"Devil I rebuke you\" and I saw that I was heard\n'Cause no matter what I've been through, I could deal with it\nAnd because of what I went through, I was still fitted\nWith the armor that comes with the blood of Jesus\nKnowing even when we're suffering, He sees us\nOr when you're lost He will lead the flock to find the one\nJust like any father trying to find his son\nAnd let me remind you, no matter where you at He will find you\nAnd help you put the negative behind you\nLord, give me a sign!\nPlease let me know you're here, or at least let me know you're near\nRemind me to call you, when we need you\nRemind me to call you, because we all need to\nAnd give us the strength to just make it through just one more day\nIn Jesus' mighty name we pray\nAmen"}}, {"title": "Problem Child",

and I will pray for tomorrow\nI thank you Lord for the love of my life and a friend\nI made a promise and I'm loving my wife til the end\nI thank you Lord for your guidance 'cause it's all that counts\nAnd right here, right now, Lord this is your house\nI thank you Lord for a dream that came true to light\nAnd I ask you to bless everybody in this room tonight\nI don't always do the right thing and I ask you to forgive me\n'Cause I need you here wit me, without you in my life, it's empty\nI think back how some people did me like, violence was the remedy\nAnd because I think of that now, I pray for my enemy\nNot because of what I'll do but because they don't know\nThere's somethin better after here but everybody won't go\nSo I ask you to forgive them and we'll hope they see\nAnd I thank you for the love that they've given to me\nI will not abuse it nor will I lead them astray\nYou see I love em like children,that I see everyday\nAnd I pray.. no, we pray together\nTo get us through the bad weather, and we love you forever\nLet your thought and my heart go hand in hand\nI first thought but to start, but I stand a man\nAnd for as long as I can, as long as you permit me\nPlease give me the strength I need to live, bear with me, Amen\n\nWe each walk the path that we've chosen (Yes)\n\nI'm ready to meet him 'cause where I'm livin' ain't right\nBlack hate white, white hate black, it's right back to the same fight\nThey got us suspectin' a war\nBut the real war is to follow the law of the Lord\n\nLord, you left me stranded and I don't know why\nTold me to live my life, now I'm ready to die\nReady to fly, I cry, but I shed no tears\nYou told me you would dead those fears, it's been years\nSnakes still comin' at me, just missin'\nSometimes I think all you do with me is just listen\nI thought that I was special, that's what you told me\nHold me, stop actin' like you don't know me\nWhat I do so bad that it sent you away from me?\nNot only sent you away, but made you stay away from me?\n\"My child I'm here as I've always been\nIt is you who went away and now are back again\nWhat did I say?\" Follow your word and be true\n\"What did you do?\" Well, what I wanted to do\n\"What have you seen?\" Darkness and hell at a glance\n\"What do you want?\" All I want is another chance\n\nI'm ready to meet him 'cause where I'm livin' ain't right\nBlack hate white, white hate black, it's right back to the same fight\nThey got us suspectin' a war\nBut the real war is to follow the law of the Lord\nI'm ready to meet him 'cause where I'm livin' ain't right\nBlack hate white, white hate black, it's right back to the same fight\nThey got us suspectin' a war\nBut the real war is to follow the law of the Lord\n\n\"Just because you went away, my doors are not locked\nWanna come back home? All you gotta do is knock\"\nYou see, I left home a boy but returned as a man\nFull grown and I'm still not able to stand\n\"I gave you a hand.\" Well but I was lookin' the wrong way\nFigured out the plan, then I started to pray\nAnd that prayer took me from here, over there\nBack to over here, now it got me like where\nDo I belong, do I fit in?\nThings on my mind, where do I begin?\nIt's easier to sin but it hurts my heart\nI'm really tryna win, so where do we start?\n\"Thou shalt not steal.\" But what if he stole from me?\n\"Thou shalt not kill.\" But what if he's tryin' to kill me?\n\"Thou shalt not take my name in vain\nNo matter how hard it rains, withstand the pain\"\n\nI'm ready to meet him 'cause where I'm livin' ain't right\nBlack hate white, white hate black, it's right back to the same fight\nThey got us suspectin' a war\nBut the real war is to follow the law of the Lord\nI'm ready to meet him 'cause where I'm livin' ain't right\nBlack hate white, white hate black, it's right back to the same fight\nThey got us suspectin' a war\nBut the real war is to follow the law of the Lord\nI'm ready to meet him\n\nOur Father who art in Heaven\nI'm not ashamed to ask for guidance at 27\nNo longer afraid to knock on your door\nNot scared anymore to lose my life in the war\nAfter what I just saw, I'm ridin' with the Lord\n'Cause I really can't afford to lose my head by the sword\nAnd now that I've seen what I need to see\nPlease take me where I need to be\n\"What have you learned?\" It's better to tell the truth than to lie\n\"What have you learned?\" To love my life until I die\n\"What have you learned?\" Violence isn't always the key\n\"What have you learned?\" You can't always believe what you see\n\"What have you learned?\" It's better to forgive and forget\n\"What have you learned?\" Give as you expect to get\n\"What have you learned?\" That I can't go on without you\n\"What have you learned?\" I must've been a fool to ever doubt you\n\nI'm ready to meet him 'cause where I'm livin' ain't right\nBlack hate white, white hate black, it's right back to the same fight\nThey got us suspectin' a war\nBut the real war is to follow the law of the Lord\nI'm ready to meet him 'cause where I'm livin' ain't right\nBlack hate white, white hate black, it's right back to the same fight\nThey got us suspectin' a war\nBut the real war is to follow the law of the Lord\nI'm ready to meet him\n\nI'm ready to meet him\nI'm ready to meet him\nI'm ready to meet him\nI'm ready to meet him"}}, {"title": "Right Or Wrong", "album": "Redemption of the Beast", "year": null, "lyrics": "Aww man (shit)\nThat bitch (DID HE?!)\nWhat the fuck is this?\nDid he?

"This\u2026 is\u2026\u00a0my\u2026 life!\n\n(Right, wrong)\nWhatever which way they go (right, wrong)\nWhatever which way they go (right, wrong)\nWhatever which way they go (right, wrong)\nWhatever which way they go (right, wrong)\n\nYou made me a leader before I was ready to lead\nTook away my hunger but didn't give me greed\nMade me successful when I just wanted to be heard\nGive me the light, 'cause all I need is the word\nGive me a life that I'm responsible for\nI'll give Him what's right, 'cause I'm responsible for Him\nAnd into the night, I'm gonna be there with Him\nFacin' a fight, I be right there with Him\nI'm ready for Heaven, 'cause I done been through the Hell\nAnd since I was seven, I've had a story to tell\nSee, God is great, and that's why I'm still livin'\nHe gave to me, so I'ma keep on givin'\nThe bravery of a man's mind in slavery\nIs makin' me the man I was made to be\nI hate to see when cats know but don't spit it\nRight is wrong, when it's on you gon' get it\n\n(Right, wrong)\nWhatever which way they go (right, wrong)\nWhatever which way they go (right, wrong)\nWhatever which way they go (right, wrong)\nWhatever which way they go (right, wrong)\n\nI wake up frustrated, dawg, I'm hurtin' inside\nThinkin' about the brothers that put in work and then died\nA certain have tried, a certain have cried\nWhen it didn't go right, You hit me like\u2014\nYou see, things ain't always what they seem to be\nAnd the reason I dream of thee is He's with me\nAnd the reason I get through things so easily\nIs by the grace of God 'cause He sees the need to guide me\nWalk right beside me\nBecause He knows what's goin' on inside me, He tried me\nKnew where my heart was at, knew what I was thinkin'\nKnew when I was down and out, left there stinkin'\nKnew when to pick me up 'cause it got too hard\nKnew when I was gonna scream out: \"Please God!\"\nAnd You already knew that You would be there for me\nThat's why I bring You together to give You the glory\n\n(Right, wrong)\nWhatever which way they go (right, wrong)\nWhatever which way they go (right, wrong)\nWhatever which way they go (right, wrong)\nWhatever which way they go (right, wrong)\n\nEveryday of life is a new chapter\nAnd it's already been foretold, so it's up to the soul to capture\nThe essence of it all, the meek shall inherit the Earth\nDestined to ride with the call from birth\nThe true worth of a man is not measured by what he does for himself, but what he does for someone else\nAnd if you help another, without concern for a reward or gold\nWhat you give, you shall recieve tenfold\nAnd I put that on my soul, and put that on my life\nAnd everything I own, and everything I know\nAnd everything I show is what I was meant to do\nEverything I told you is what I've been through\nAnd everwhere I been, I was for a reason\nWalked through the desert, ended up freezin'\nStart there, end up where? And now they know\nWhatever which way they go\n\nWhatever which way they go (right, wrong)\nWhatever which way they go (right, wrong)\nWhatever which way they go (right, wrong)\nWhatever which way they go (right, wrong)\nWhatever which way they go (right, wrong)\nWhatever which way they go (right, wrong)\nWhatever which way they go (right, wrong)\nWhatever which way they go (right, wrong)\n\nWhatever which way they go\nThey know they gonna owe\nThey soul to the road they choose\nIt don't matter if you win or lose\nYou still gotta pay them dues\nYou still gotta pay them dues\nYou still gotta pay them dues"}}, {"title": "Rob All Night (If I'm Gonna Rob)", "album": "Grand Champ", "year": "2003-09-16", "lyrics": "If I'm gonna rob, I'mma rob all night (yeah!)\nIf I'm lookin' for something' then it's probly a fight\nIf I'm gonna fuck bitches then they better be tight\nIf that's dead, then the head better be right (C'mon)\n\nHere we go again, fuckin right\nDog man X baby, dog for life\nKnow how this shit go, built off fights\nBitch dog be like \"AIGH, AIGH, AIGH\"\nOOH, this rap shit be getting kinda hectic\nIt's not a game nigga, cats don't respect it\nReal shit's been neglected for far too long\nLet's get it on!\nI jump off slugs like packages from UPS\nBut you run when you see X\nPull out the front when you see Tex\nPOW, the light is what you see next\nFuck who you listenin' to, I'm the badest\n98% of this industry is faggots\nDue alone niggas don't want no static\nWhent hey say who shot J R it won't be Dalas\n\n\nY'all niggas don't know how the dog livin'\nNo matter what I do I keep on winnin'\nCan't stop me now.

know Dasher and Dancer, Prancer and Vixen\nComet and Cupid and Donner and Blitzen\nBut do you recall (what's that?)\nThe most famous reindeer of all?\n(Come on)\n\nRudolph the Rednose Reindeer\nHad a very shiny nose\nAnd if you ever saw it\nYou would even say it grows (come on, come on)\nAll of the other reindeer\nUsed to laugh and call him names\nThey never let poor Rudolph\nJoin in any reindeer games\n\nThen one foggy Christmas Eve\nSanta came to say (what's that?)\nRudolph with your nose so bright\nWon't you guide my sleigh tonight?\n\nThen all the reindeers loved him\nAs they shouted out with glee\nRudolph, the Rednose Reindeer\nYou'll go down in history (forever)\nYou'll go down in history (forever)\nYou'll go down in histor-\nYou'll go down in histor-\nYou'll go down in history (now get it)\n\n(What's that?)\n\nThen all the reindeers loved him\nAs they shouted out with glee\nRudolph, the Rednose Reindeer\nYou'll go down in history (forever)\nYou'll go down in history

present!\nYo, yo, yo!\nAyo if gon' sleep on something, might as well be a bed\nAnd if you gon' crack a nigga, might as well be a head\nCause if you targeting the L.O.X., you might as as well target a box\nThat you gon' sleep in for years, all covered wit rocks\nCause I think not, I pop shots, I double what y'all got\nYa hotshots ain't got blocks, ?llabuta? muchacha\nFrom the days in school, now a motherfucker rule\nAnd I could drop my chain in coffee and keep shit cool\nThat's how ice be, I'm priceless, the iciest\nAnd I dont gotta wear fatigues to blow out your chest\nMy bullets thump when I'm laced in some fly shit, punk\nThe baby nine be on the daily, ain't no poppin a trunk\nBut if I pop the trunk, its to hand you a rag\nSo you can wipe down the windows on the side of my Jag\nMust I brag? My shit paid for, yours tagged\nAnd every bitch you grabbed\nSheek bend em back\nAyo I hope you ain't tongue-kissin your spouse\nCause I be makin love in her in the mouth\nType of cat buck at your house\nToo slick, means she be suckin my dick\nAnd before you know it, I'ma have her stuffin my bricks\nJada, if I kiss you now, you'll die later\nI been nice since people was watchin movies on Beta\nReady to clap, everybody givin me that\nCause believe it or not, we be the ones settin the traps\nYou listen to y'all hits, then listen to our hits\nAin't nuttin y'all cowards could do but gossip\nThat's the reason now y'all players ain't got chips\nCause everytime I turn around y'all on the L.O.X. dick\nNiggas thats narrow, I just smack em wit the barrel\nGive it to em at the light, like Kane's cousin Abel\nThe Ruff Ryders! (What?) The Ruff Ryders!\nThe Ruff Ryders! (What?) The Ruff Ryders!\nThe Ruff Ryders! (What?) The Ruff Ryders!\nThe Ruff Ryders! (What?) The Ruff Ryders!\nCatch you and your son\nYa know when its done\nShow me the money, I show you a gun\nCocksucka!!\nSP'll spin corner while you party with dun\nI clap you I clap him, and thats rule number one\nSuckin' my clip!\nAnd I don't give a hell what you spit\nWho you are, where you from, and who the hell you can get\nCuz I sell records, plus I got a jail record\nYa niggas ain't sayin' shhhh until ya'll bare weapons\nIm 3 years older than 20, holdin a Henney\nCan rip a dolla bill but can't fold up a penny\nWanna murder Styles cocksucka load up the semi\nIm at your baby mom house, on the steps climbed out\nLike you played the don out, bout to rip your arms out\nYou done screwed up and did it, tryin to act like you with it\nCame two in ur short sleeves, three in your fitted\nAnd even when you dead, you can still flinch and get it\nA ryda that'll smack ya, cock back and clap ya\nStyles P ya favorite rappers favorite rapper\nAin't no surprise killaz, only fuck wit recognized killaz\nBabygirl want the world, gave ya pies killaz\nNo tops, take em in all shape and size niggas\nNo lie, prefer them ready do or die killaz\nWhat? What you want? cutey starin at me like\n\"Damn, where you from?\"\nYou be comin at me like \"Can I get some?\"\nLick your lips for this brown sugar\nSuck mine like a thumb, if you want, til I uhhh...\nThe Ruff Ryders!

The Ruff Ryders!\nI be the D-R, A-G, dash O-N, slash often Comma, burnin niggasz often\nThey call me Drag-On, I'm hot scorchin\nKeep the block roastin Light a dutch wit the flames comin, toastin\nIn my eyes you could see what summer's holdin\nRealizin, every guy I'll fry or dead rowdy\nI burn to a degree of 130, and my gun dirty\nCause it got one bury, so you better run, hurry Or catch one early\nYou wrong, tryin to touch me, what type of shit you on?\nYou better through your boots on and your unflammable suits on\nCause I'm comin through wit a Yukon Black tinted wit gats in it\nCatch you while you smokin, send your casket, throw the sack in it\nBut only half of it, cause y'all like half-ass dude\nAnd we are one whole, and y'all niggas is one slash two\nMy gun blast you, tryna out the flames, what're you, firemen?\nYou'll catch a hell of a Backdraft cause my fire retirin, aight then\nIts my, survival instinct that keeps my head above the water\nEveryday I show another how a lover slaughter\nFlood your daughter, full of more holes than spurges\nTaxin businessmen for stocks over lunches\nWit these, I shoot the breeze, and extort\nEnough keys from the Cuban, to build a fuckin fort\nCaught up in somethin that I can't control\nTryna get a hold of a bankroll, let's role\nCatch bodies like a cold, and I stay slick so face it\nMake me chase it, I take your life and erase it\nWasted, in the fuckin streets cause it ain't worth shit\nThe undertaker take your ass unbder the earth quick\nI Love money, but the scrambles hot\nSo i snatch up my man and the gamblin spot\nTwenty grand is got, when niggas shot, one nigga less\nWhat used to be his chest is now a mess under his fuckin vest", "image":

for years, all covered wit rocks\nCause I think not, I pop shots, I double what y'all got\nYa hotshots ain't got blocks, ?llabuta? muchacha\nFrom the days in school, now a motherfucker rule\nAnd I could drop my chain in coffee and keep shit cool\nThat's how ice be, I'm priceless, the iciest\nAnd I dont gotta wear fatigues to blow out your chest\nMy bullets thump when I'm laced in some fly shit, punk\nThe baby nine be on the daily, ain't no poppin a trunk\nBut if I pop the trunk, its to hand you a rag\nSo you can wipe down the windows on the side of my Jag\nMust I brag? My shit paid for, yours tagged\nAnd every bitch you grabbed\nSheek bend em back\nAyo I hope you ain't tongue-kissin your spouse\nCause I be makin love in her in the mouth\nType of cat buck at your house\nToo slick, means she be suckin my dick\nAnd before you know it, I'ma have her stuffin my bricks\nJada, if I kiss you now, you'll die later\nI been nice since people was watchin movies on Beta\nReady to clap, everybody givin me that\nCause believe it or not, we be the ones settin the traps\nYou listen to y'all hits, then listen to our hits\nAin't nuttin y'all cowards could do but gossip\nThat's the reason now y'all players ain't got chips\nCause everytime I turn around y'all on the L.O.X. dick\nNiggas thats narrow, I just smack em wit the barrel\nGive it to em at the light, like Kane's cousin Abel\nThe Ruff Ryders!

my eyes you could see what summer's holdin\nRealizin, every guy I'll fry or dead rowdy\nI burn to a degree of 130, and my gun dirty\nCause it got one bury, so you better run, hurry Or catch one early\nYou wrong, tryin to touch me, what type of shit you on?\nYou better through your boots on and your unflammable suits on\nCause I'm comin through wit a Yukon Black tinted wit gats in it\nCatch you while you smokin, send your casket, throw the sack in it\nBut only half of it, cause y'all like half-ass dude\nAnd we are one whole, and y'all niggas is one slash two\nMy gun blast you, tryna out the flames, what're you, firemen?\nYou'll catch a hell of a Backdraft cause my fire retirin, aight then\nIts my, survival instinct that keeps my head above the water\nEveryday I show another how a lover slaughter\nFlood your daughter, full of more holes than spurges\nTaxin businessmen for stocks over lunches\nWit these, I shoot the breeze, and extort\nEnough keys from the Cuban, to build a fuckin fort\nCaught up in somethin that I can't control\nTryna get a hold of a bankroll, let's role\nCatch bodies like a cold, and I stay slick so face it\nMake me chase it, I take your life and erase it\nWasted, in the fuckin streets cause it ain't worth shit\nThe undertaker take your ass unbder the earth quick\nI Love money, but the scrambles hot\nSo i snatch up my man and the gamblin spot\nTwenty grand is got, when niggas shot, one nigga less\nWhat used to be his chest is now a mess under his fuckin vest"}}, {"title": "Ruff Radio 2 (Skit)", "album": "Grand Champ", "year":

bed\nTwo more to the head, got the floor red\nYea that nigga's dead\nAnother unsolved mystery, It's goin' down in history\nNiggas ain't never did shit to me\nBitch ass niggas can't get to me\nGots to make the move, got a point to prove\nGot a make'em grove, got'em all like ooh\nSo to the next time, you hear this nigga rhyme\nTry to keep your mind, on gettin pussy and crime\nStop, drop, shut 'em down open up shop\nOh, no\nThat's how Ruff Ryders roll", "image": "https://images.genius.com/1bcf43b1cc0f34db6cd70e1a63c8b84c.464x464x1.jpg", "artist": "DMX", "raw": {"annotation_count": 1,

a bid, ripped you up, while you wit your kid\nSlid into the shadows, cause I'm dark like that\nI bark like that, jet black, but I spark like that\nWhere ARE they at, when I get thirsty, shit\nAin't a nigga strong enough to stand the worst it gets\nBits, and pieces are all thats that left\nNiggas so scared to death, they hold they motherfuckin breath\nTil I pass, cause they asked, and I smelled em\nThe S-P-E-L-L-E-D T-H-E-M, I spelled em\nTo make me have to swell one, eye up, lump up one head\nCatch a body with the shottie, pump up one dead\nRed alert, niggas is about to get hurt, do work\nTo skirts, like a jag on the merk, ARF\nNight time is the right time for creepin\nVandalize your crib, rape your wife while she's sleepin\nI been off the deep end, since I was semen\nThat's why now, I'm such a motherfuckin demon!\nSCREAMIN, my bloody head off, shit on my mind I gotsta get off\nCan't even hold a joint, lest I let off\nA couple of rounds, from the big three pound, seven\nThat's about eleven hundred as of now\nChorus- (2 times)\nYukmouth (DMX):\nWe ride, side to side, guys back to back, (nigga)\nSurrounded by a wolfpack, tryin to scrap with gats\nYou betta ride or die, nigga ride or die, (uh huh, uh huh)\nYou gotta ride or die, nigga ride or die!\nDrag-On:\nI put a grenade in your pocket to blow your arms out\nPut something black in your moms mouth, ya'll cats better calm down\nThis rap shit is Drag-On's now, if I catch ya'll clowns\nNo question what I axe (ask) ya'll clowns, I'ma gat ya'll down\nFor the benjamin bills, I shoulda been killed\nI keeps it real though\nFor these plats though I leave nothin but widows\nYou're a gang, but so what, can you really bang with us?\nBe like a phone, cause we off the hook\nAnd ya'll better hang it up\nI stay high, but I don't plan to go to heaven\nI plan to burn like the furnace, til ya'll learn\nEven if it's with the burners\nUntil your mom can dish straight, forget her son\nTo give her the dick, tore a clip and I stripped her one\nFor that's dragon, that's the one\nWhat's blastin, that's his gun\nWho's lastin, no one\nSo if you splashin to blow one\nLike I said before, I'ma lock it down like Shaqula\nSo make your sister be the ??? and none back to her\nYukmouth:\nAfter midnight, busta niggas can't even hang out\nNiggas on the west, we put them dank things out\nDrive by and try to blow them fuckin brains out\nAnd cocaine drought\nSurvive and reside with a new click\nBut use the same route\nPull the range out\nGet brains pal, while I'm drivin\nLive and direct, front five and a tech\nStash in the Range, but nine in the Lex\nGot bitches, shining briggets, for me\nGrindin correct, for me\nSignin off checks, for me\nSend a bitch outta town, now she buyin the bricks, for me\nPasses from the brick, homie\nKeep grindin with your click, homie\nCause on top there's no way\nCock your chromayy\nStock your monayyy\nFeds caught the homayyy\nIt's just the monay got coppers on mayyy\nHelicopters on mayyy, bust off the blockers phonayyy\nRamshack this house, put choppers on it\nBitches safe and shit, niggas takin shit\nBreak his wrist, pistol whipping duck tape his

triple-beam men\nGive me a quarter key, I bet I flip a key\nBy the weekend, our styles are grand theiven\nIf not, niggas ain't leavin\nUnless they bleed the demon prayer from my deacon\nIn front of the casket, you done it you bastard\nI pack mathematics to keep it crackin\nHead ride to ask it, BITCH!\nDMX:\nHow-can-one-man-kill-so-many-and\nThe-sin-be-plenty-before-the-age-of-20\nLife ain't

that they don't know what they holdin\nNiggas called me TAILOR cause the WAY that I be sewin\nShit up cause I get up, off my ass and SKATE\nMakin more moves than U-Haul, from state to state\nI speak the GREAT, and if a nigga tells you different\nYou turn around you ask the nigga, \"FUCK is you be sniffin?\"\nCause when it come to riffin, I am the riff raffin\nGots to say nuttin, niggas know they

Yeah, now we on the west coast (nigga)\nHooked up with my partners, Ruff Ryders\nTo represent the turf\nCome to lay down the turf stories\nTo represent real brothers gettin money, on the paper chase (nigga)\nWe gon start off with my man, so, you know what I'm sayin, DMX let em know\nDMX:\nNiggas is gettin trampled on, what's all the fuss about?\nSuckin my dick so hard, I'm bustin in their mouth\nAnd then I stuff em out, four to the mid', fuck what I did\nWith no regard for a bid, ripped you up, while you wit your kid\nSlid into the shadows, cause I'm dark like that\nI bark like that, jet black, but I spark like that\nWhere ARE they at, when I get thirsty, shit\nAin't a nigga strong enough to stand the worst it gets\nBits, and pieces are all thats that left\nNiggas so scared to death, they hold they motherfuckin breath\nTil I pass, cause they asked, and I smelled em\nThe S-P-E-L-L-E-D T-H-E-M, I spelled em\nTo make me have to swell one, eye up, lump up one head\nCatch a body with the shottie, pump up one dead\nRed alert, niggas is about to get hurt, do work\nTo skirts, like a jag on the merk, ARF\nNight time is the right time for creepin\nVandalize your crib, rape your wife while she's sleepin\nI been off the deep end, since I was semen\nThat's why now, I'm such a motherfuckin demon!\nSCREAMIN, my bloody head off, shit on my mind I gotsta get off\nCan't even hold a joint, lest I let off\nA couple of rounds, from the big three pound, seven\nThat's about eleven hundred as of now\nChorus- (2 times)\nYukmouth (DMX):\nWe ride, side to side, guys back to back, (nigga)\nSurrounded by a wolfpack, tryin to scrap with gats\nYou betta ride or die, nigga ride or die, (uh huh, uh huh)\nYou gotta ride or die, nigga ride or die!\nDrag-On:\nI put a grenade in your pocket to blow your arms out\nPut something black in your moms mouth, ya'll cats better calm down\nThis rap shit is Drag-On's now, if I catch ya'll clowns\nNo question what I axe (ask) ya'll clowns, I'ma gat ya'll down\nFor the benjamin bills, I shoulda been killed\nI keeps it real though\nFor these plats though I leave nothin but widows\nYou're a gang, but so what, can you really bang with us?\nBe like a phone, cause we off the hook\nAnd ya'll better hang it up\nI stay high, but I don't plan to go to heaven\nI plan to burn like the furnace, til ya'll learn\nEven if it's with the burners\nUntil your mom can dish straight, forget her son\nTo give her the dick, tore a clip and I stripped her one\nFor that's dragon, that's the one\nWhat's blastin, that's his gun\nWho's lastin, no one\nSo if you splashin to blow one\nLike I said before, I'ma lock it down like Shaqula\nSo make your sister be the ??? and none back to her\nYukmouth:\nAfter midnight, busta niggas can't even hang out\nNiggas on the west, we put them dank things out\nDrive by and try to blow them fuckin brains out\nAnd cocaine drought\nSurvive and reside with a new click\nBut use the same route\nPull the range out\nGet brains pal, while I'm drivin\nLive and direct, front five and a tech\nStash in the Range, but nine in the Lex\nGot bitches, shining briggets, for me\nGrindin correct, for me\nSignin off checks, for me\nSend a bitch outta town, now she buyin the bricks, for me\nPasses from the brick, homie\nKeep grindin with your click, homie\nCause on top there's no way\nCock your chromayy\nStock your monayyy\nFeds caught the homayyy\nIt's just the monay got coppers on mayyy\nHelicopters on mayyy, bust off the blockers phonayyy\nRamshack this house, put choppers on it\nBitches safe and shit, niggas takin shit\nBreak his wrist, pistol whipping duck tape his bitch\nChorus (2 times)\nYukmouth:\nBitch, to all my niggas locked in Rita and Simson\nWe still the ice cream men\nJust switched it up from a truck to a great benz\nWe made men, and kingpins, triple-beam men\nGive me a quarter key, I bet I flip a key\nBy the weekend, our styles are grand theiven\nIf not, niggas ain't leavin\nUnless they bleed the demon prayer from my deacon\nIn front of the casket, you done it you bastard\nI pack mathematics to keep it crackin\nHead ride to ask it, BITCH!\nDMX:\nHow-can-one-man-kill-so-many-and\nThe-sin-be-plenty-before-the-age-of-20\nLife ain't worth a penny in, my book faggot\nThat's why I took faggot shit, I'm a crook faggot\nFat loops leather jackets, I bag it, along with\nThe jewels smackin tools out the hands of fools\nOn the strength that they don't know what they holdin\nNiggas called me TAILOR cause the WAY that I be sewin\nShit up cause I get up, off my ass and SKATE\nMakin more moves than U-Haul, from state to state\nI speak the GREAT, and if a nigga tells you different\nYou turn around you ask the nigga, \"FUCK is you be sniffin?\"\nCause when it come to riffin, I am the riff raffin\nGots to say nuttin, niggas know they get half\nAnd I can still laugh, at those who's toes I'm steppin on\nDisrespect and pulling out a weapon on\nNice joint, I know you wish you coulda kept it on\nBut that's another story, don't even sweat, it's gone (echo gone)"}}, {"title": "Scenario 2000", "album": "Rap Sheet",

Wrong ho!\"\n\nUhh, yo yo\u2026 yo, not this shit again\nDog gon' be a dog, y'knahmean? Motherfucking dog!\nDon't get a dog if you can't take care of a dog\nGotta take care of the dog, y'know? Y'know?\nTake it easy lady, y'know? Uh-huh\nGive me a motherfucking break, will ya?\n\nShorty was the bomb, brownskin honey with a little dough\nCome to find out she was a lil hoe, but still, yo\nI pushed up, shorty had that ass like blaow\nHad me scheming on how I could get that now\nWas like girlfriend, let me drop a bug in yo' ear\nShe was mine cause I told her what she wanted to hear\nWas like yeah, she knew how it was going down\nShe said page me, code zero, cause I know you get around\nDidn't have a man, but even if she did dead\nCause my game is tight like a stocking cap on a nigga's head\nI said, we'll get up like nine or somethin'\nDon't act like when I say that ass is mine I'm frontin'\nThat night was right, she let me get that, hit that\nRip that, bounce it off the walls, flip that\nBut only, one thing went wrong, the rubber bust\nBut I didn't fuss cause, dog, shorty was the bomb\n\nShorty, UH! We only did it for that night\nBut man, the pussy was good\nBut shorty's fucking up my life, fucking up my life\nShorty, UH! We only did it for that night\nBut man, the pussy was good\nBut shorty's fucking up my life\nC'mon, ma, give me a break!\n\nA few days later, I hit her up just to keep it real\nWas like, \"Whassup, boo? How you been? How you feel?\"\nShe said, \"Aight, but my friend's kinda late\nToday's the 13th, and it should've been here on the 8th\"\nI'm like, \"For real?! Don't stress it, it'll come\nIt better cause I can't afford another little one\"\nShe said, \"Neither can I\", I said, \"Cool\nCause I got mad shit to do and you still going to school\"\nSo at least we had the same thing in mind\nNot to have this kid and everything would be fine\nBut I was blind to the fact that she was setting me up\nFor the kill, damn, why wasn't she on the pill?\nAnd I still would check on her like once a week\nSometimes I hit it, sometimes I didn't, but shorty was a freak\nAnd whenever I would speak on the baby\nShorty would be like, \"I ain't having this kid, is you crazy?\"\n\n\nBy now, wasn't looking too good\nCause she wasn't doing things that she told me she would\nLike getting the price checked out for what we had to do\nAnd it goes up another yard for every month after two\nAnd a half, I had to laugh out of frustration\nNow she's four months, I'm ready to hit the bus station\nIf I was still on that shit it would've made me rob her\nTold her friends, \"DMX? Yeah, that's my baby's father\"\nHer lil' stomach is shown, so now the heat is on\nMaybe she'll see the light if I start to treat her wrong\nLike if she thought that if she kept the baby she would keep me, so I played the game on her level, got sneaky\nLet her have the kid, she said it was premature\nFound out she was six months when she said she was four\nSo I left her with the pressure on the next man's arm\nBut she'll be aight, cause shorty was the bomb", "image": "https://images.genius.com/afd6872a63df0f464c2e3cf8eb96a627.500x500x1.jpg", "artist": "DMX", "raw": {"annotation_count": 10,

just one problem\nI'm all the way to fucking Rochester, New York. Wrong ho!\"\n\nUhh, yo yo\u2026 yo, not this shit again\nDog gon' be a dog, y'knahmean? Motherfucking dog!\nDon't get a dog if you can't take care of a dog\nGotta take care of the dog, y'know? Y'know?\nTake it easy lady, y'know? Uh-huh\nGive me a motherfucking break, will ya?\n\nShorty was the bomb, brownskin honey with a little dough\nCome to find out she was a lil hoe, but still, yo\nI pushed up, shorty had that ass like blaow\nHad me scheming on how I could get that now\nWas like girlfriend, let me drop a bug in yo' ear\nShe was mine cause I told her what she wanted to hear\nWas like yeah, she knew how it was going down\nShe said page me, code zero, cause I know you get around\nDidn't have a man, but even if she did dead\nCause my game is tight like a stocking cap on a nigga's head\nI said, we'll get up like nine or somethin'\nDon't act like when I say that ass is mine I'm frontin'\nThat night was right, she let me get that, hit that\nRip that, bounce it off the walls, flip that\nBut only, one thing went wrong, the rubber bust\nBut I didn't fuss cause, dog, shorty was the bomb\n\nShorty, UH! We only did it for that night\nBut man, the pussy was good\nBut shorty's fucking up my life, fucking up my life\nShorty, UH! We only did it for that night\nBut man, the pussy was good\nBut shorty's fucking up my life\nC'mon, ma, give me a break!\n\nA few days later, I hit her up just to keep it real\nWas like, \"Whassup, boo? How you been? How you feel?\"\nShe said, \"Aight, but my friend's kinda late\nToday's the 13th, and it should've been here on the 8th\"\nI'm like, \"For real?! Don't stress it, it'll come\nIt better cause I can't afford another little one\"\nShe said, \"Neither can I\", I said, \"Cool\nCause I got mad shit to do and you still going to school\"\nSo at least we had the same thing in mind\nNot to have this kid and everything would be fine\nBut I was blind to the fact that she was setting me up\nFor the kill, damn, why wasn't she on the pill?\nAnd I still would check on her like once a week\nSometimes I hit it, sometimes I didn't, but shorty was a freak\nAnd whenever I would speak on the baby\nShorty would be like, \"I ain't having this kid, is you crazy?\"\n\n\nBy now, wasn't looking too good\nCause she wasn't doing things that she told me she would\nLike getting the price checked out for what we had to do\nAnd it goes up another yard for every month after two\nAnd a half, I had to laugh out of frustration\nNow she's four months, I'm ready to hit the bus station\nIf I was still on that shit it would've made me rob her\nTold her friends, \"DMX? Yeah, that's my baby's father\"\nHer lil' stomach is shown, so now the heat is on\nMaybe she'll see the light if I start to treat her wrong\nLike if she thought that if she kept the baby she would keep me, so I played the game on her level, got sneaky\nLet her have the kid, she said it was premature\nFound out she was six months when she said she was four\nSo I left her with the pressure on the next man's arm\nBut she'll be aight, cause shorty was the bomb"}}, {"title": "Shot Down", "album": "Grand Champ", "year": "2003-09-16", "lyrics": "Over and over I done told ya, boy\nI'm a G-Unit motherfucking soldier, boy\nAnd when you gon' get it in your brain?\nThe gate's wide open and the dogs off the chain\n\nI be that youngin with that gun that\u2019s tellin' ya stop frontin'\nI be that yougin on the run after I pop somethin'\nIn the Bible I read death is of the tongue\nAnd if you talk about death enough death is gon' come\nJay taught me how to flow, they shot him in the head\nRandy ass was there, now he runnin' scared\nSome say I'm gangsta, some say I'm crazy\nIf you ask me I'll say I'm what the hood made me\nNow I can stunt 'til my ass dead broke like JD\nOr put a hundred grand on every nigga head that play me\nSee I'm cool with them Haitian mob niggas\nThey say ''Sak pase Nap boule'' and rob niggas\nThe media be tryin' to make a nigga look bad, what's with that?\nSee my flick next to Preme, Papi and Cat\nAnd Montana, I kill 'em with the grammar\nI enhanced in the slammer after bangin them hammers\nX, what up? (Aight)\n\nYou don't live that, you shouldn't say that\nCause what come out your mouth'll get you shot down\nThrowin' your money around and we don't play that\nGetting in our line'll get you shot down\nWe know where you hang, we know where you stay at\nThat bullshit you on'll get you shot down\nHere's a few cliques that you shouldn't play with\nG-Unit, Ruff Ryders'll get you shot down\n\nFuck

handful of man still standin'\nI remember 50 in a cypher when Onyx was \"Slammin\"\nNow we meet again, it's all good, my nigga\nBack to the street again, it's all hood, my nigga\nKnock on wood, my nigga, we both walk the dog\nWe ain't get to where we at by luck, shit was hard\nBut once we got through the trials it's all smiles\n'Til a big type nigga all of a sudden get wild\nNow why you gotsta go and take me back to where I came from?\nI'mma make you remember where you know my name from\n45th Street, and blaow-blaow Ave\nI done ran through your crew and only let off half, nigga\n\n\nIf your head ain't off of your shoulders\nYou ain't get shot, you got nicked nigga (just nicked)\nCause if my chrome hit a piece of your bone\nIt's gon' do more than chip, nigga (a lot more than that)\nYeah, what the fuck is the problem?\nThe Porsche is red, the buckets is army\n30 shot handguns, the gutter is starvin\nNiggas like me might rush your apartment\nBloodstains'll fuck up your carpet, brain on the window\nI smell murder every time that the wind blow\nTie him to the chair and then knock out his chinbone\nI don\u2019t want the throne or the crown, I ain\u2019t sell enough\nYou can have the jail or the ground, you ain't in hell enough\nI'm the one that flood the gutters\nBetter tap your man and let him know P'll love to cut his\nAnd niggas is gettin shot down, two guns up\nDouble R,

with that gun that\u2019s tellin' ya stop frontin'\nI be that yougin on the run after I pop somethin'\nIn the Bible I read death is of the tongue\nAnd if you talk about death enough death is gon' come\nJay taught me how to flow, they shot him in the head\nRandy ass was there, now he runnin' scared\nSome say I'm gangsta, some say I'm crazy\nIf you ask me I'll say I'm what the hood made me\nNow I can stunt 'til my ass dead broke like JD\nOr put a hundred grand on every nigga head that play me\nSee I'm cool with them Haitian mob niggas\nThey say ''Sak pase Nap boule'' and rob niggas\nThe media be tryin' to make a nigga look bad, what's with that?\nSee my flick next to Preme, Papi and Cat\nAnd Montana, I kill 'em with the grammar\nI enhanced in the slammer after bangin them hammers\nX, what up? (Aight)\n\nYou don't live that, you shouldn't say that\nCause what come out your mouth'll get you shot down\nThrowin' your money around and we don't play that\nGetting in our line'll get you shot down\nWe know where you hang, we know where you stay at\nThat bullshit you on'll get you shot down\nHere's a few cliques that you shouldn't play with\nG-Unit, Ruff Ryders'll get you shot down\n\nFuck y'all niggas talkin' 'bout, think you playin' with?\nDouble R, G-Unit, the same old shit\nPut the faggots in the ring, watch 'em all quit\nAll y'all niggas is pussy, suck my dick\nAin't nothin' but a handful of man still standin'\nI remember 50 in a cypher when Onyx was \"Slammin\"\nNow we meet again, it's all good, my nigga\nBack to the street again, it's all hood, my nigga\nKnock on wood, my nigga, we both walk the dog\nWe ain't get to where we at by luck, shit was hard\nBut once we got through the trials it's all smiles\n'Til a big type nigga all of a sudden get wild\nNow why you gotsta go and take me back to where I came from?\nI'mma make you remember where you know my name from\n45th Street, and blaow-blaow Ave\nI done ran through your crew and only let off half, nigga\n\n\nIf your head ain't off of your shoulders\nYou ain't get shot, you got nicked nigga (just nicked)\nCause if my chrome hit a piece of your bone\nIt's gon' do more than chip, nigga (a lot more than that)\nYeah, what the fuck is the problem?\nThe Porsche is red, the buckets is army\n30 shot handguns, the gutter is starvin\nNiggas like me might rush your apartment\nBloodstains'll fuck up your carpet, brain on the window\nI smell murder every time that the wind blow\nTie him to the chair and then knock out his chinbone\nI don\u2019t want the throne or the crown, I ain\u2019t sell enough\nYou can have the jail or the ground, you ain't in hell enough\nI'm the one that flood the gutters\nBetter tap your man and let him know P'll love to cut his\nAnd niggas is gettin shot down, two guns up\nDouble R, S.P., holdin' D Block down"}}, {"title": "Shout it", "album": "Redemption of the Beast", "year": "2015-01-15", "lyrics": "If you know god is working in your life\nShout it\nIf you know god then you're gon' be alright\nShout it\nIf you know god and you know what he's like\nShout it\nIf you know god then just jump and shout it\nShout it\n\nTime wasting, all things that I'm chasing\nEating but don't like what I'm tasting\nEverything I thought I want and hunted for\nHad me wondering but then I wanted \nHeaded down the wrong path, self-destructive\nWhat's my function?

sayin' gotta deal with the ruthless one\nIt's 2 piece,leave your faggot ass toothless son\nI go hard,dog don't do it!,too late,it's done\nHold up,I'ma show you why dog is the illest,kill this\nYou might not catch it,but you'll feel this\nThe realest nigga to ever do it,the realest nigga to ever go through it\nAnd y'all gon' bring me back to it\nY'all gon' make me lose my mind\nMiddle name is grime,came from crime\nThought I'mma change by time,niggas don't know me\nBut you can't hold somethin'\nYou ain't got it,show me"}}, {"title": "Slippin'", "album": "Flesh of My Flesh, Blood of My Blood", "year": "1998-11-27", "lyrics": "This life shit, this life shit is like\nIs like bugged the fuck out, son, for real\nSee, to live is to suffer\nBut to survive\u2026\nWell, that's to find meaning in the suffering\n\nAyo I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I can't get up\nAyo I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I can't get up\nAyo I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I gots to get up\nGet me back on my feet so I can tear shit up\nAyo I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I can't get up\nAyo I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I can't get up\nAyo I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I gots to get up\nGet me back on my feet so I can tear shit up\n\nI've been through mad different phases like mazes, to find my way\nAnd now I know that happy days are not far away\nIf I'm strong enough I'll live long enough to see my kids\nDoin' somethin' more constructive with their time than bids\nI know because I been there, now I'm in there\nSit back and look at what it took for me to get there\nFirst came the bullshit, the drama with my mama\nShe got on some fly shit so I split and said that I'ma\nBe that seed that doesn't need much to succeed\nStrapped with mad greed and a heart that doesn't bleed\nI'm ready for the world or at least I thought I was\nBaggin' niggas when I caught a buzz\nFor thinkin' about how short I was\nGoin' too fast, it wouldn't last, but yo, I couldn't tell\nGroup homes and institutions prepared my ass for jail\nThey put me in a situation forcin' me to be a man\nWhen I was just learnin' to stand without a helping hand\nDamn, was it my fault, somethin' I did\nTo make a father leave his first kid at seven doin' my first bid?\nBack on the scene at fourteen with a scheme\nTo get more cream than I'd ever seen in a dream\nAnd by all means I will be livin' high off the hog\nAnd I never gave a fuck about much but my dog\nThat's my only mothafucka I had offered my last\nJust another little nigga headed nowhere fast\n\nAyo I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I can't get up\nAyo I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I can't get up\nAyo I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I gots to get up\nGet me back on my feet so I can tear shit up\nAyo I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I can't get up\nAyo I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I can't get up\nAyo I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I gots to get up\nGet me back on my feet so I can tear shit up\n\nThat ain't the half, shit gets worse as I get older\nActions become bolder, heart got colder\nChip on my shoulder that I dared a nigga to touch\nDidn't need a clique 'cause I scared a nigga that much\nOne deep with the pit startin' shit for kicks\nCatchin' Vicks, throwin' bricks, gettin' by bein' slick\nUsed to get high, used to get by\nUsed to have to puff my L in the morning before I get fly\nAte somethin', a couple of forties made me hate somethin'\nI did some coke, now I'm ready to take somethin'\nThree years later showin' signs of stress\nDidn't keep my hair cut or give a fuck how I dressed\nI'm possessed by the darker side livin' the cruddy life\nShit like this kept a nigga with a bloody knife\nWanna make records but I'm fuckin' it up\nI'm slippin', I'm fallin', I can't get up\n\nAyo I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I can't get up\nAyo I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I can't get up\nAyo I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I gots to get up\nGet me back on my feet so I can tear shit up\nAyo I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I can't get up\nAyo I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I can't get up\nAyo I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I gots to get up\nGet me back on my feet so I can tear shit up\n\nWasn't long before I hit rock bottom\nNiggas talkin' shit, was like, \"Damn, look how that rock got him!\"\nOpen like a window, no more endo\nLook at a video, sayin' to myself: \"That coulda been yo'\nAss on the TV,\" believe me, it could be done\nSomething's got to give, gots to change 'cause now I've got a son\nI gots to do the right thing for shorty\nAnd that means no more gettin' high, drinkin' 40s\nSo I get back lookin' type slick again\nFake niggas jump back on my dick again\nNothin' but love for those that know how it feel\nAnd much respect to all my niggas that kept it real\nKept a nigga strong, kept a nigga from doin' wrong\nNiggas know who they is and this is your fuckin' song\nAnd to my boo who stuck with a nigga through\nAll the bullshit, you'll get yours because it's due\n\nAyo I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I can't get up\nAyo I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I can't get up\nAyo I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I gots to get up\nGet me back on my feet so I can tear shit up\nAyo I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I can't get up\nAyo I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I can't get up\nAyo I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I gots to get up\nGet me back on my feet so I can tear shit up\n\nSee, this is that shit, this is that shit\nThat all real niggas can relate to\nThis is from the heart, baby\nDon't get it twisted\nX, baby", "image": "https://images.genius.com/515da11d5d46252f603d04fda8629f34.945x945x1.jpg", "artist": "DMX", "raw": {"annotation_count": 32, "api_path": "/songs/17479",

life shit, this life shit is like\nIs like bugged the fuck out, son, for real\nSee, to live is to suffer\nBut to survive\u2026\nWell, that's to find meaning in the suffering\n\nAyo I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I can't get up\nAyo I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I can't get up\nAyo I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I gots to get up\nGet me back on my feet so I can tear shit up\nAyo I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I can't get up\nAyo I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I can't get up\nAyo I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I gots to get up\nGet me back on my feet so I can tear shit up\n\nI've been through mad different phases like mazes, to find my way\nAnd now I know that happy days are not far away\nIf I'm strong enough I'll live long enough to see my kids\nDoin' somethin' more constructive with their time than bids\nI know because I been there, now I'm in there\nSit back and look at what it took for me to get there\nFirst came the bullshit, the drama with my mama\nShe got on some fly shit so I split and said that I'ma\nBe that seed that doesn't need much to succeed\nStrapped with mad greed and a heart that doesn't bleed\nI'm ready for the world or at least I thought I was\nBaggin' niggas when I caught a buzz\nFor thinkin' about how short I was\nGoin' too fast, it wouldn't last, but yo, I couldn't tell\nGroup homes and institutions prepared my ass for jail\nThey put me in a situation forcin' me to be a man\nWhen I was just learnin' to stand without a helping hand\nDamn, was it my fault, somethin' I did\nTo make a father leave his first kid at seven doin' my first bid?\nBack on the scene at fourteen with a scheme\nTo get more cream than I'd ever seen in a dream\nAnd by all means I will be livin' high off the hog\nAnd I never gave a fuck about much but my dog\nThat's my only mothafucka I had offered my last\nJust another little nigga headed nowhere fast\n\nAyo I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I can't get up\nAyo I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I can't get up\nAyo I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I gots to get up\nGet me back on my feet so I can tear shit up\nAyo I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I can't get up\nAyo I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I can't get up\nAyo I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I gots to get up\nGet me back on my feet so I can tear shit up\n\nThat ain't the half, shit gets worse as I get older\nActions become bolder, heart got colder\nChip on my shoulder that I dared a nigga to touch\nDidn't need a clique 'cause I scared a nigga that much\nOne deep with the pit startin' shit for kicks\nCatchin' Vicks, throwin' bricks, gettin' by bein' slick\nUsed to get high, used to get by\nUsed to have to puff my L in the morning before I get fly\nAte somethin', a couple of forties made me hate somethin'\nI did some coke, now I'm ready to take somethin'\nThree years later showin' signs of stress\nDidn't keep my hair cut or give a fuck how I dressed\nI'm possessed by the darker side livin' the cruddy life\nShit like this kept a nigga with a bloody knife\nWanna make records but I'm fuckin' it up\nI'm slippin', I'm fallin', I can't get up\n\nAyo I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I can't get up\nAyo I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I can't get up\nAyo I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I gots to get up\nGet me back on my feet so I can tear shit up\nAyo I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I can't get up\nAyo I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I can't get up\nAyo I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I gots to get up\nGet me back on my feet so I can tear shit up\n\nWasn't long before I hit rock bottom\nNiggas talkin' shit, was like, \"Damn, look how that rock got him!\"\nOpen like a window, no more endo\nLook at a video, sayin' to myself: \"That coulda been yo'\nAss on the TV,\" believe me, it could be done\nSomething's got to give, gots to change 'cause now I've got a son\nI gots to do the right thing for shorty\nAnd that means no more gettin' high, drinkin' 40s\nSo I get back lookin' type slick again\nFake niggas jump back on my dick again\nNothin' but love for those that know how it feel\nAnd much respect to all my niggas that kept it real\nKept a nigga strong, kept a nigga from doin' wrong\nNiggas know who they is and this is your fuckin' song\nAnd to my boo who stuck with a nigga through\nAll the bullshit, you'll get yours because it's due\n\nAyo I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I can't get up\nAyo I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I can't get up\nAyo I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I gots to get up\nGet me back on my feet so I can tear shit up\nAyo I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I can't get up\nAyo I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I can't get up\nAyo I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I gots to get up\nGet me back on my feet so I can tear shit up\n\nSee, this is that shit, this is that shit\nThat all real niggas can relate to\nThis is from the heart, baby\nDon't get it twisted\nX, baby"}}, {"title": "Slippin Again",

me wait\nFuck around and I'm gon' bite you and snatch the plate\n\nI could flip that flow, I could stick that ho\nI could get that dough, you know I'm with that, yo\nAin't a thing about the shit I came through I haven't seen\nBut when it gets dark, it's like a nigga's havin' dreams\nOr nightmares, the light dares to desert me\nGot me like everybody wants to hurt me\nParanoid, so I strike out at whatever\nThe closest thing to me is gonna get it, but never\nWill I, can I think death is wrong\nSo I'ma keep holdin' on 'til what's left is gone\nYou could put that on my nigga Boom\nThese other rap cats will give a nigga room\nBut if it calls for me to force my way in the door\nHeadhuntin' motherfuckas, stay on the floor\n4-4, that's what I get sick with (Grrrrrrr)\nFour more, now all this is liquid (Grrrrrr)\n\nY'all been eatin' long enough now, stop bein' greedy\nJust keep it real, partner, give to the needy\nRibs is touchin', so don't make me wait\nFuck around and I'm gon' bite you and snatch the plate\n\nI thank the Lord everyday that I'm blessed with a gift\nI'm the best, so unless you wanna rest with the stiff\nDon't touch that, uh-uh, leave it alone\nWhen you walk pass the doghouse, leave it a bone\nDogs bite, dogs fight, dogs knife\nScratch, shake, and hold all night\nSo when you hear the arf arf, start runnin'\n'Cause when you hear the arf arf, I'm comin'\nBut I don't like drama, so I stay to myself\nKeep focus with this rap shit and pray for the wealth\nI want the money, just give me the honeys with big asses\nThe most expensive champagne you got in big glasses\nI'm broke so I'ma bash his head wide open\nBeggin' me to stop, but at least he died hopin'\nDidn't get his wish, and now he's a dish for the pack\nTwo glowin' red eyes, everything else is black\n\nY'all been eatin' long enough now, stop bein' greedy\nJust keep it real, partner, give to the needy\nRibs is touchin', so don't make me wait\nFuck around and I'm gon' bite you and snatch the plate\n\nWhen the sun is up, the gun is up on the shelf\nAnd all the runners up are thankin' me for their help\nHopin' that they not around when it gets dark outside\nWhen the sun's goin' down, you hear the bark outside\nLocks off the cage, gauge with the buck shots\nFaggot, you've been lucky all day, that's when your luck stops\nOne drops, then another and another\nGun pops, goin' through you and your mother\nWhen does it all end? I found a friend in a dog\n'Cause fuckin' with these cats will send a friend to the morgue\nMany questions, no answers, just stress\nTry to hold my head and remember that I'm blessed\nWith the curse and it gets worse as time goes by\nCan't see straight 'cause I'm so high\nWhy ask why when you know?\nNigga, when it's your time to go, you go\n\nY'all been eatin' long enough now, stop bein' greedy\nJust keep it real, partner, give to the needy\nRibs is touchin', so don't make me wait\nFuck around and I'm gon' bite you and snatch the plate", "image": "https://images.genius.com/0b6cb8276258dfa665ebef7633a54557.300x234x1.jpg", "artist": "DMX", "raw": {"annotation_count": 15, "api_path": "/songs/4647", "description": {"dom": {"tag": "root", "children": [{"tag": "p", "children": ["One of the singles of DMX\u2019s album It\u2019s Dark and Hell is Hot"]}]}}, "embed_content": "<div id='rg_embed_link_4647' class='rg_embed_link' data-song-id='4647'>Read <a href='https://genius.com/Dmx-stop-being-greedy-lyrics'>\u201cStop Being Greedy\u201d by DMX</a> on Genius</div> <script crossorigin src='//genius.com/songs/4647/embed.js'></script>", "featured_video": false, "full_title": "Stop Being Greedy by\u00a0DMX", "header_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/0b6cb8276258dfa665ebef7633a54557.300x234x1.jpg", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/0b6cb8276258dfa665ebef7633a54557.300x234x1.jpg", "id": 4647, "lyrics_owner_id": 7299, "lyrics_state": "complete", "path": "/Dmx-stop-being-greedy-lyrics", "pyongs_count": 75, "recording_location": "Power House Studios in New York City and Soundtracks Studios in New York City", "release_date": "1998-03-07", "song_art_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/0b6cb8276258dfa665ebef7633a54557.300x234x1.jpg", "song_art_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/0b6cb8276258dfa665ebef7633a54557.300x234x1.jpg", "stats": {"accepted_annotations": 9, "contributors": 31, "hot": false, "iq_earners": 31, "transcribers": 0, "unreviewed_annotations": 6, "verified_annotations": 0, "pageviews": 22004}, "title": "Stop Being Greedy", "title_with_featured": "Stop Being Greedy", "url": "https://genius.com/Dmx-stop-being-greedy-lyrics", "current_user_metadata": {"permissions": ["see_pageviews", "create_comment", "view_song_story_gallery"], "excluded_permissions": ["follow", "award_transcription_iq", "remove_transcription_iq", "pyong", "edit_lyrics", "view_annotation_engagement_data", "publish", "unpublish", "edit_spotify_details", "hide", "unhide", "toggle_featured_video", "add_pinned_annotation_to", "add_community_annotation_to", "destroy", "mark_as_not_spam", "edit_spotify_annotations_for", "verify_lyrics", "unverify_lyrics", "edit_anything", "edit_album_appearances", "edit_any_media", "edit", "rename", "edit_tags", "watch_fact_track", "reindex", "view_lyrics_synchronization", "enable_media", "disable_media", "edit_lyrics_or_annotation_brackets", "see_editorial_indicators", "view_attribution_visualization", "edit_youtube_url", "edit_soundcloud_url", "edit_spotify_uuid", "edit_apple_music_url", "edit_vevo_url", "moderate_annotations", "create_annotation", "see_short_id", "manage_chart_item", "create_tag", "propose_lyrics_edit", "moderate_lyrics_edit_proposals"], "interactions": {"pyong": false, "following": false}, "relationships": {}, "iq_by_action": {}}, "album": {"api_path": "/albums/2483", "cover_art_url": "https://images.genius.com/8314b41ccd0d9cc7825bc168024bdec2.630x630x1.jpg", "full_title": "It's Dark and Hell is Hot by DMX", "id": 2483, "name": "It's Dark and Hell is Hot", "url": "https://genius.com/albums/Dmx/It-s-dark-and-hell-is-hot", "artist": {"api_path": "/artists/77", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/50f7952927a22e51ffc163adbf836e6f.620x413x1.jpg", "id": 77, "image_url": "https://images.genius.com/1bcf43b1cc0f34db6cd70e1a63c8b84c.464x464x1.jpg", "is_meme_verified": false, "is_verified": false, "name": "DMX", "url": "https://genius.com/artists/Dmx"}}, "custom_performances": [{"label": "Recording", "artists": [{"api_path": "/artists/984009", "header_image_url": "https://assets.genius.com/images/default_avatar_300.png?1527887249", "id": 984009, "image_url": "https://assets.genius.com/images/default_avatar_300.png?1527887249", "is_meme_verified": false, "is_verified": false, "name": "D.

just ain't there\nAnd ain't nothing fair, I knew this for a long time\nThats why with ever wrong crime comes anotha strong rhyme\nAnd thats mo' time under the belt, you felt what I had\nAnd I shouldn't have even done it, thats what made this shit sad\nI'm doin' bad, but if I gots to feel it, you gots to feel it\nAnd if a nigga can't afford it, I gots to steal it\nAnd that's how real it,

sick'nen\nPlastic don't hide the smell for too long, I do wrong\nAnd so I don't have nightmares I forget about it, move on\nKeep gettin my groove on, 'cuz that shit could fuck with'choo\nKeep dwellin on it, and its gonna get stuck with you\nNiggas try their luck with you, 'cuz they smell ass\nAnd money if you pussy, I'm gonna be able to tell fast\nSome cop I'm about to smack across the face in this robbery\nI'm on a robbin spree, and ain't no STOPPIN ME\nOn this real, thats why a nigga stay writin\n'Cuz kid this shit is real, what you think we play fightin\nYou must of saw som'thin funny, or never saw som'thin bloody\nOr you don't know I'll bring it to your door 'cuz I'm cruddy\nLike puddy, when I hold you niggas, I mold you niggas\nI done told you niggas, that I been owed you niggas\nFor that shit you did that you wasn't built for\nShit I guess you didn't know you do get killed for\nI done filled niggas up with the extended clip\nIts like I blew this joint down with the extended rip\nOr that non-stop, when the bomb drops\nI'mma take it from where you at and then end up on ya moms block\nFrom here to Comstock, niggas gettin bust wild\nCell cagers last night from lock out just died?\nAin't no where to hide, ain't no wear to run\nWhat more can they do to a man that ain't been done\nA mind is a terrible thing to waste\nEspecially if its all over the place, your mind all over his face\nHow do brains taste, when they mixed with gun powder\nSemi to fully automatic makes the gun louder\nI got som'thin to fix pain when I kicks game\n'Cuz I'mma float off more tracks

blatant\nThat with all the blood here, I'm dealing with Satan\nPlus with all the hating, it's hard to keep peace (uh huh)\nThou shall not steal, but I will to eat\nI tried doing good, but good's not too good for me\nMisunderstood, why you chose the hood for me\nMe? I'm aight; I just had to work hard at it\nWent to grandma for the answer and she told me that God had it\nSo now here I am, confused and full of questions\nAm I born to lose or is this just a lesson?\nAnd who is going choose when it gets turned around\nAnd will it be laying in my own blood and on the ground?\nMy child, I've watched you grow up and I've been there\nEven at those times you least suspected it, I was there\nAnd look at what I've given you - a talent to rhyme\nI may not come when you call, but I'm always on time\n\nSomebody's knockin'\nShould I let em in\nLord, we're just startin'\nBut where will it end\nSomebody's knockin'\nShould I let em in\nLord, we're just startin'\nBut where will it end\n\nBut when the funds are low, the guns'll blow\nLooking for that one that owe, make 'em run that dough\nNo! Put down the guns and write a new rhyme\nYou'll get it all in due time, you'll do fine, just have faith cause you mine\nAnd when you shine, it's gon' be a sight to behold\nSo don't fight to be old or lose sight when it's cold\nSee that light down the road? It's gon' to guide you there\nTwo sets of footprints; I was right beside you there\nBut what about them times I only saw one?\nThose were the times when I was under the gun\nIt was then I carried you my son\nLed you to safety, it just wasn't your time to face me (uh huh)\nAyo a few of them times I thought you would erase me\nBut all you did was embrace me, prepared me for the worst\nOffered me eternal life and scared me with the hearse\nAnd the curse turned to grace when the hurt turned to faith\nNo more running or sliding in the dirt cause I'm safe\n\nSomebody's knocking\nShould I let em in\nLord we're just starting\nBut where will it end\nSomebody's knocking\nShould I let em in\nLord we're just starting\nBut where will it end\n\nSo if I'm your man, I'm in your hands, what's your plan\nNever had a friend 'cause you couldn't trust your man\nLearned to stand before I crawled, things were twisted\nAnd if you showed me anything at all, then I missed it\nLooked the wrong way, I've done some wrong things\nKept a bad attitude, but that's what wrong brings\nAnd now you mean to tell me that after all this time\nIt was you that kept the dog from goin' out of my mind?\nIt was you that breathed life into my lungs when I was born?\nAnd it was you that let me know what was right from what was wrong?\nAnd it was you that let me do, what I knew what could be done?\nAnd it was you that gave me a good wife and a beautiful son?\nAnd it's been you speaking to me inside my mind?\nAnd it's been you who has forgiven time after time?\nIt was you who opened my eyes so I could see?\nAnd it was you that shined your light on me?", "image": "https://images.genius.com/8314b41ccd0d9cc7825bc168024bdec2.630x630x1.jpg", "artist": "DMX", "raw": {"annotation_count": 25, "api_path": "/songs/17467", "description": {"dom": {"tag": "root", "children": [{"tag": "p", "children": ["\u201cThe Convo\u201d was labeled an \u201cabsolution poem\u201d by ", {"tag": "em", "children": [{"tag": "a", "attributes": {"href": "https://books.google.ae/books?id=sCwEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA90&lpg=PA90", "rel": "nofollow"}, "children": ["Vibe Magazine"]}]}, "\u2026 and rightfully so.

dealing with Satan\nPlus with all the hating, it's hard to keep peace (uh huh)\nThou shall not steal, but I will to eat\nI tried doing good, but good's not too good for me\nMisunderstood, why you chose the hood for me\nMe? I'm aight; I just had to work hard at it\nWent to grandma for the answer and she told me that God had it\nSo now here I am, confused and full of questions\nAm I born to lose or is this just a lesson?\nAnd who is going choose when it gets turned around\nAnd will it be laying in my own blood and on the ground?\nMy child, I've watched you grow up and I've been there\nEven at those times you least suspected it, I was there\nAnd look at what I've given you - a talent to rhyme\nI may not come when you call, but I'm always on time\n\nSomebody's knockin'\nShould I let em in\nLord, we're just startin'\nBut where will it end\nSomebody's knockin'\nShould I let em in\nLord, we're just startin'\nBut where will it end\n\nBut when the funds are low, the guns'll blow\nLooking for that one that owe, make 'em run that dough\nNo! Put down the guns and write a new rhyme\nYou'll get it all in due time, you'll do fine, just have faith cause you mine\nAnd when you shine, it's gon' be a sight to behold\nSo don't fight to be old or lose sight when it's cold\nSee that light down the road? It's gon' to guide you there\nTwo sets of footprints; I was right beside you there\nBut what about them times I only saw one?\nThose were the times when I was under the gun\nIt was then I carried you my son\nLed you to safety, it just wasn't your time to face me (uh huh)\nAyo a few of them times I thought you would erase me\nBut all you did was embrace me, prepared me for the worst\nOffered me eternal life and scared me with the hearse\nAnd the curse turned to grace when the hurt turned to faith\nNo more running or sliding in the dirt cause I'm safe\n\nSomebody's knocking\nShould I let em in\nLord we're just starting\nBut where will it end\nSomebody's knocking\nShould I let em in\nLord we're just starting\nBut where will it end\n\nSo if I'm your man, I'm in your hands, what's your plan\nNever had a friend 'cause you couldn't trust your man\nLearned to stand before I crawled, things were twisted\nAnd if you showed me anything at all, then I missed it\nLooked the wrong way, I've done some wrong things\nKept a bad attitude, but that's what wrong brings\nAnd now you mean to tell me that after all this time\nIt was you that kept the dog from goin' out of my mind?\nIt was you that breathed life into my lungs when I was born?\nAnd it was you that let me know what was right from what was wrong?\nAnd it was you that let me do, what I knew what could be done?\nAnd it was you that gave me a good wife and a beautiful son?\nAnd it's been you speaking to me inside my mind?\nAnd it's been you who has forgiven time after time?\nIt was you who opened my eyes so I could see?\nAnd it was you that shined your light on me?"}}, {"title": "The Dog in Me", "album": "Real Dreams 2", "year": "2017-04-21", "lyrics": "(grrrrr) This is where the magic happens baby\nThis is where the magic happens\nAw man\n\nThe bark in me\nIt's the dog in me\nSo pop the leash 'cuz ain't no walkin' me\nJump a muthafucka like there's a frog in me\nAll on me\nNuthin' but war to me (C'mon!)\nThe bark in me\nIt's the dog in me\nSo pop the leash 'cuz ain't no walkin' me\nJump a muthafucka like there's a frog in me\nAll on me\nNuthin' but war to me (C'mon!)\n\nLet the dog out let the dog out\nThat's how it go down how it go down\nI got the key so ima let it free\nFeel the melody now let me proceed\nThe dog in me that gives me what I need\nThe dog in me they think it's a disease\nSo let me be what ima be\nLet you see the dog in me (oooh)\n\nI don't ever cry\n'Cuz I already died\nAnd I don't need to fly\n'Cuz I'm already high\nAnd all these snakes wanna know 'bout what I feel inside\nI wanna dig up a grave and bury them inside (goodbye)\nSo what's up, homie\nWhat you want from me?\nI'm bad by myself I depend on me only\nI survive solely, on the grace of God, homie\nI need to find my way so I ask that He show me\nSo I pray, Our Father, then Hail Mary, Glory be to God tell me can you hear me\nAs I walk through the valley of the shadow of death\nI inspect each step 'cuz I fear what's next\n'Cuz in my mind, I'm dumping on you bastards\nLeaving closed caskets, burning you with battery acids\nAnd if you think my reaction is drastic\nI'll wrap you in plastic, leave you stretched out like Mr. Fantastic\n\nThe bark in me\nIt's the dog in me\nSo pop the leash 'cuz ain't no walkin' me\nJump a muthafucka like there's a frog in me\nAll on me\nNuthin' but war to me (C'mon!)\nThe bark in me\nIt's the dog in me\nSo pop the leash 'cuz ain't no walkin' me\nJump a muthafucka like there's a frog in me\nAll on me\nNuthin' but war to me (C'mon!)\n\nLet the dog out let the dog out\nThat's how it go down how it go down\nI got the key so ima let it free\nFeel the melody now let me proceed\nThe dog in me that gives me what I need\nThe dog in me they think it's a disease\nSo let me be what ima be\nLet you see the dog in me (oooh)\n\nDid you know I been through hell already?\nOD'ed already, almost died already?\nNo irie, kinda like Ox in Belly\nSo if the Lord wants to take my life I'm ready 'cuz...\nThe world got me going insane\nIt's like a full time job to lock the dog away\nBut it will break out so you best watch out\n'Cuz ya can't talk shit with a dick in yo mouth\nNo one iller with the butterfly trigger\nRapid fire rap with with a flow so killah\nHit and run kill ya with an 18-wheeler\nThen leave you like the walking dead MJ thriller\nAnd I know I should join society\nAnd follow laws and say apologies\nBut I just can't 'cuz their hypocrisy\nJust bothers me, it's just the dog in me!

a frog in me\nAll on me\nNuthin' but war to me (C'mon!)\nThe bark in me\nIt's the dog in me\nSo pop the leash 'cuz ain't no walkin' me\nJump a muthafucka like there's a frog in me\nAll on me\nNuthin'

I need\nThe dog in me they think it's a disease\nSo let me be what ima be\nLet you see the dog in me (oooh)\n\nI don't ever cry\n'Cuz I already died\nAnd I don't need to fly\n'Cuz I'm already high\nAnd all these snakes wanna know 'bout what I feel inside\nI wanna dig up a grave and bury them inside (goodbye)\nSo what's up, homie\nWhat you want from me?\nI'm bad by myself I depend on me only\nI survive solely, on the grace of God, homie\nI need to find my way so I ask that He show me\nSo I pray, Our Father, then Hail Mary, Glory be to God tell me can you hear me\nAs I walk through the valley of the shadow of death\nI inspect each step 'cuz I fear what's next\n'Cuz in my mind, I'm dumping on you bastards\nLeaving closed caskets, burning you with battery acids\nAnd if you think my reaction is drastic\nI'll wrap you in plastic, leave you stretched out like Mr. Fantastic\n\nThe bark in me\nIt's the dog in me\nSo pop the leash 'cuz ain't no walkin' me\nJump a muthafucka like there's a frog in me\nAll on me\nNuthin' but war to me (C'mon!)\nThe bark in me\nIt's the dog in me\nSo pop the leash 'cuz ain't no walkin' me\nJump a muthafucka like there's a frog in me\nAll on

gives me what I need\nThe dog in me they think it's a disease\nSo let me be what ima be\nLet you see the dog in me (oooh)\n\nDid you know I been through hell already?\nOD'ed already, almost died already?\nNo irie, kinda like Ox in Belly\nSo if the Lord wants to take my life I'm ready 'cuz...\nThe world got me going insane\nIt's like a full time job to lock the dog away\nBut it will break out so you best watch out\n'Cuz ya can't talk shit with a dick in yo mouth\nNo one iller with the butterfly trigger\nRapid fire rap with with a flow so killah\nHit and run kill ya with an 18-wheeler\nThen

miraculous breakthroughs; in the midst of great impossibilities\nI receive recognition, prominence and honor\nPetitions are granted to me even by ungodly authorities\nPolicies, rules, regulations and laws are changed and reversed on my behalf\nI win battles that I don't even have to fight because God fights them for me\nThis is the day, the set time, the designated moment for me to experience the

good\nMay we be heard and understood from the suburbs to the hood\nMay you judge us by our hearts and not by our mistakes\nAnd see that we get a breakthrough however long that it takes\nMay you fill that void in our souls that will lay our fears to rest\nCause there is no way we can live for Jesus when we're liven in the flesh\nSo I pray that you allow our sprits to be born\nGrow strong, move on, know right from wrong\nFirst John, chapter two, verse 15\nDo not love the world or anything in the world\nAnd we know what that means, but listen\nWe know the distance we need to be away from fire to keep it missin\nThat doesn't mean we'll listen\nLord you take care of fools and babies\nYou teach women to honor their men and men respect their ladies\nBut lately so many of us have gone a stray\nDoing wrong for so long that we've forgotten the way\nPlease bring us back home, instill in us the word which is our backbone\nWe're just children that act grown\nThere is so much that we're entitled to yet we receive so little\nCause in this time of spiritual warfare we're comfortable in the middle\nSo I pray that you open our eyes\nGive us the annointing to recognize the devil and his lies\nIf we keep our actions wise and our prays sincere\nOur heads to the sky you will demonist our fears\nIn Jesus' mighty name we have prayed\nAmen and amen"}}, {"title": "The Professional",

it is\nJust because for the past 20 years\nEveryday it is (WhAt?)\nNow I know\nOnly I can stop the rain\nI won't even be able to walk out my front door\nWithout worrying about coming to conflict with the law\nCuz\nNow I know\nOnly I can stop the rain\nIf I follow him, they'll follow me\nAnd I'll speak life into the words that you can see\nCuz\nNow I know (c'mon)\nOnly I can stop the rain\nWe get away with it everyday shit\nBut everyday shit catches up with you\nAnd when it does you can't say shit\nNow I know\nOnly I can stop the rain\nIf I don't, you will\nWhat I won't, you still\nWhat makes us feel like we gots to kill\nWhen\nNow I know\nOnly I can stop the rain\nHow many more lives must we lose\nHow many more times must we choose\nTo trust these fools\nNow I know\nOnly I can stop the rain\nIf it ain't broke, don't fix it\nI gave it to you straight, don't mix it\nTwist it (what) up for some slick shit\nNow I know\nOnly I can stop the rain\nI don't have to talk to it anymore\nI don't have to walk to it anymore\nI'm out the door (what)\nNow I know\nOnly I can stop the rain\nI wanna find peace with the lord\nI don't wanna find the peace with the sword\nI can't afford to\nNow I know\nOnly I can stop the rain\nWhen everyday of my life\nIs just a constant fight\nBetween wrong and right\nNow I know\nOnly I can stop the rain\nI thank you lord for my life\nI thank you lord for keeping it loose when things got tight\nNow I know\nOnly I can stop the rain\nOnly I can stop the rain\nOnly I can stop the pain\nNow I know\nOnly I can stop the rain\nOnly I can stop the rain, stop the rain\nOnly I can stop the rain\nOnly I can stop the rain because the rain calls on me\nNow I know\nOnly I can stop the rain\nOnly I can stop the rain\nI'm out"}}, {"title": "The Shakedown (Skit)",

said the shit, so I know you meant the shit you said\n\n\nBorn with addiction with fast living with high stakes\nI race down a highway of life with no breaks\nMake no apologies for the risks that I

up(what!)\nNow you laid up and won't get up\nNow look at what the fuck you got yourself into\nAll i did was open the curtains and you jumped out the window\nThat's what suckers do\nYou just a punk

I knew that's how you smelled\nAll you cats do is play around, with your speech\nTalkin 'bout, what you got, ain't air in the teeth\nYou can, put on a vest but, I'ma still stop ya\nCause I got a chopper that sound like a helicopter\nAnd niggas really don't want me to pop the trunk\nWe gon' either chop or slump when I cock and dump\nWhether the Glock or pump, cats ain't ready\nHalf from here to here, lookin like spaghetti\nPull out the machete, hack off the limbs\nBag up the pieces, wipe off the Timbs\nJump in the Benz, five cars deep\n4 o'clock in the morning, riders still asleep\nShut shit down whenever we hit town\nGIVE A NIGGA PASS! I lay my dick down\nYou can, bring out the best or, bring out the worst\nYou gon' bring out the worst, we gon' bring out the hearse\nNiggas play poker, I play poke-her\nHit her from ear to ear make her smile like The Joker!"}}, {"title": "We Right Here", "album": "The Great Depression", "year": "2001-10-23", "lyrics": "Bring it!

to sleep\nBut I keep goin', goin'\nShit, I'm always careful when I walk, I'm always seein', knowin'\nThe dog gone live\nStay walkin the wire, over the fire, when I can I give\nThe dog is good, and how

pop pop of stainless steel\nGo hard, getting busy wit it\nBut I got such a good heart\nThat I'll make a motherfucker wonder if he did it\nDamn right, and I'll do it again, cause I am right so I gots to win\nBreak bread with the enemy, but no matter how many cats I break bread with I'll break who you sendin' me\nYou motherfuckers never wanted nothing\nBut your life saved, bitch, and that's on a light day\nI'm getting down, down like a nigga said \"Freeze!\"\nBut won't be the one ending up on his knees\nBitch please, if the only thing you cats did\nWas came out to play, stay out my way, motherfucker!\n\nFirst we gonna rock, then we gonna roll\nThen we let it pop, go, let it go!\nX gon' give it to ya, he gon' give it to ya\nX gon' give it to ya, he gon' give it to ya\n\nFirst we gonna rock, then we gonna roll\nThen we let it pop, go, let it go!\nX gon' give it to ya, he gon' give it to ya\nX gon' give it to ya, he gon' give it to ya\n\nAin't never gave nothing to me\nBut every time I turn around\nCats got they hands out wanting something from me\nI ain't got it, so you can't get it\nLet's leave it at that cause I ain't with it\nHit it with full strength\nI'm a jail nigga, so I
