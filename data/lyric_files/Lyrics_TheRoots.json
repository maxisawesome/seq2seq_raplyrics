yo, knahmsayin what\nYo-yo, yo, 100%\n\nYo, on these seventy-three keys, of ivory and ebony\nI swear solemnly that I'll forever rock steadily\nPeople wanna know where Malik, he right next to me\nThe weaponry, the secret recipe\nHard to peep this, deep shit, shows I eat with\nContaminated thoughts I walk the street with\nI bayonet cassettes and chop beats with\nThis olympic lyricism you can't, compete with\nGlobe traveling, throwing your verse like a javelin\nThings Fall Apart and MC's unraveling\nBackstage whispering to management like\nChange the order, it's no way that we can rock after them\nMy man sport the 'fro like What's Happenin'\nFrom the latest hi-atus, The Roots back again\nYour crew practicing to catch this natural blend\nThey packages read, care when handling\nIt's all soft shit, batteries not included with\nMatter of fact, your whole front's a re-enactment\nI blow your ba-tty ass into fragments, P5D\nThe new testament, mic specialist, what\nCheck it out, yo\nCheck it out, yo\nCheck it out, yo\nYo yo Black Thought, I represent the Fifth Dynasty\nLyrical click, 100% Dundee\n\nMalik B, I represent the P-phi-D\nGuerilla click, 100% Dundee\n\nBlack Thought, I

seems out, all through your block\nPosse don't play the cut, but what, you get sheist\nGot the personality named trife, ready to heist\nSmashin 'graphs, snatch the ice, crush your mental device\nThought twice, shoulda thought once, got played for the dunce\nDialogues I moderate, cool out, we outta state\nJust blendin in the great, give me room to ventilate\nMost niggas is fraudulent, the rap seargeant\nBargin, through your regiment, call your president\nHittin all targets cuz it's a cause that's lost\nBetween the killers when they probably Teddy Ruxpin soft\nDroppin tears of steel, two drops up in the bucket\nFacing three hots and a cot so yo fuck it\nIf I get abducted, trapped up in the belly\nWacked up my celly, get known like Dawn Staley\nYou know the deally on the daily in the ?\nIf I sense you got a bend to your kite, then send it up\nWe press up on your corner with windows they're tinted up\nLay our props face down on the ground and get it up, what?\nFace on the ground and get it up\n\nYo yo, Black Thought, I represent the Fifth Dynasty\nLyrical click, 100% Dundee\n\nMalik B, I represent the P-phi-D\nGuerilla click, 100% Dundee\n\nBlack Thought, I

secret recipe\nHard to peep this, deep shit, shows I eat with\nContaminated thoughts I walk the street with\nI bayonet cassettes and chop beats with\nThis olympic lyricism you can't, compete with\nGlobe traveling, throwing your verse like a javelin\nThings Fall Apart and MC's unraveling\nBackstage whispering to management like\nChange the order, it's no way that we can rock after them\nMy man sport the 'fro like What's Happenin'\nFrom the latest hi-atus, The Roots back again\nYour crew practicing to catch this natural blend\nThey packages read, care when handling\nIt's all soft shit, batteries not included with\nMatter of fact, your whole front's a re-enactment\nI blow your ba-tty ass into fragments, P5D\nThe new testament, mic specialist, what\nCheck it out, yo\nCheck it out,

who don't claim or aim\nTo be a preacher or ordained\nI have black thoughts, therefore my name's the same\nDon't question my ability, in a studio facility\nAs I utilize my God-given utility\nOn time, I get behind and push along a rhyme\nOf mine, which I design, with wealth of mind\nLeave MC's blind with amnesia\nChop 'em into salad and my name ain't Caesar\nThink twice before you approach\nGet benched by the coach, like eggs you're poached\nI wrote murder, so you can say it's Murder He Wrote\nYou think I'm Hell sent, so you repent to the Pope\nDon't walk when the sign says not to\nAnd don't

sign says not to\nAnd don't talk when Black Thought's about to\nWhen I say \"Maestro\" and bro starts to play it\nIf you got a rhyme in your mind, then don't say it\nSave it for the weaker, pack your portable speaker\nAnd utilize the treads on your sneaker\nTake your sorry crew back and forget about rappin'\nForget you ever saw me and forget this ever happened\nCause you might have nightmares of

them snake head niggas\nThat take care of niggas who don't break bread with us\nNiggas make dead niggas and hate black niggas\nBrown niggas high yellow niggas and them red niggas\nNo tellin' when the bullet comin', be prepared niggas\nCause when it do it coming land, sea and air niggas\nThat's everywhere niggas\nAm I the muthafuckin' legendary\nYeah niggas, make it very clear niggas\nBeen looking at y'all in my rearview\nMirror niggas want to be a millionaire, I'm already there niggas\nI'm the debonair nigga, a bear taking more than my share\nLookee here, yeah, I know it ain't fair nigga\nNeither is a bald eagle with a hair trigger\nHaystack, try and find a needle up in there nigga\nLeave you up in there nigga, show me the puppet\nThat don't need a puppeteer nigga, shed another tear nigga\nI'm in the field with a shield and a spear nigga\nI'm in your girl with her heels in the air nigga\nI am such a rare nigga, you in a battle telling\nMe you not ready like you figured I'mma bear with you\nI don't care nigga, you now listening to the sounds\nOf the money making jam trillionaires nigga\nGentlemen of an extraordinary league\nYou never see me blowing on no ordinary weed\nWhat I'm smoking ain't a product of no ordinary seed\nYour boy is heavy treed, I'm feeling merry\nAs a Tyler Perry scene, that monetary gang green\nWe tried to launder the cash and never came clean\nSo now I'm in the story with all the cats before me\nAnd smoke purgatory for doing the same thing\nAnd them niggas ain't change, them niggas can't change\nTheir moms shake their heads saying it's such a dang shame\nThe train to the bus, then another dang plane\nMy stage and my government ain't the same name\nI'm a rock star, love it that my wallet chain hang\nI'm a modern day saint; I'm a modern day king\nMy definition I can finally explain\nCold smooth like that dude Sean Connery was playing\nI just got to be the man, I'm the father figure and\nWhen I spit it's something like a psychology exam\nIf you stand where I stood, you could probably understand\nHow that mic feelin' like a million dollars in my hand\nIt's the silence of the lamb, go and cop another gram\nAnd twist with your Zanny, Percocet, Percodan\nWhat's your networking plan? you better look alive\nCause them niggas outside lookin' desperate again nigga\nAnd the blunts and liquor killin' our lungs and liver\nThe asthmatic drug addict I function with it\nI put a rapper in a hole where the dust will sit\nFor spittin' played out patterns that once was hittin'\nI got news for you all, let me show you how to ball\nSee the legendary fall, I ain't heard of that\nY'all niggas is off the wall like Arsenio Hall\nI'mma put you right back where the dirt is at\n450 fahrenheit on the thermostat\nSomebody starvin' like a white girl, Bernadette\nBut she not a earner yet, she couldn't put in no work\nFor Nat Burner yet, the black microphone murder vet\nI'm in a class of my own\nIf I got beef with you, you the last one to know\nI arrive on time, I'm never fashionable\nYou late, I'm already international-able\nI done twirled in Berlin, banged in Beijing\nYou never seen nothin' can't say the same

on their waist, yeah, waste weird niggas\nAnd erase scared niggas, them snake head niggas\nThat take care of niggas who don't break bread with us\nNiggas make dead niggas and hate black niggas\nBrown niggas high yellow niggas and them red niggas\nNo tellin' when the bullet comin', be prepared niggas\nCause when it do it coming land, sea and air niggas\nThat's everywhere niggas\nAm I the muthafuckin' legendary\nYeah niggas, make it very clear niggas\nBeen looking at y'all in my rearview\nMirror niggas want to be a millionaire, I'm already there niggas\nI'm the debonair nigga, a bear taking more than my share\nLookee here, yeah, I know it ain't fair nigga\nNeither is a bald eagle with a hair trigger\nHaystack, try and find a needle up in there nigga\nLeave you up in there nigga, show me the puppet\nThat don't need a puppeteer nigga, shed another tear nigga\nI'm in the field with a shield and a spear nigga\nI'm in your girl with her heels in the air nigga\nI am such a rare nigga, you in a battle telling\nMe you not ready like you figured I'mma bear with you\nI don't care nigga, you now listening to the sounds\nOf the money making jam trillionaires nigga\nGentlemen of an extraordinary league\nYou never see me blowing on no ordinary weed\nWhat I'm smoking ain't a product of no ordinary seed\nYour boy is heavy treed, I'm feeling merry\nAs a Tyler Perry scene, that monetary gang green\nWe tried to launder the cash and never came clean\nSo now I'm in the story with all the cats before me\nAnd smoke purgatory for doing the same thing\nAnd them niggas ain't change, them niggas can't change\nTheir moms shake their heads saying it's such a dang shame\nThe train to the bus, then another dang plane\nMy stage and my government ain't the same name\nI'm a rock star, love it that my wallet chain hang\nI'm a modern day saint; I'm a modern day king\nMy definition I can finally explain\nCold smooth like that dude Sean Connery was playing\nI just got to be the man, I'm the father figure and\nWhen I spit it's something like a psychology exam\nIf you stand where I stood, you could probably understand\nHow that mic feelin' like a million dollars in my hand\nIt's the silence of the lamb, go and cop another gram\nAnd twist with your Zanny, Percocet, Percodan\nWhat's your networking plan? you better look alive\nCause them niggas outside lookin' desperate again nigga\nAnd the blunts and liquor killin' our lungs and liver\nThe asthmatic drug addict I function with it\nI put a rapper in a hole where the dust will sit\nFor spittin' played out patterns that once was hittin'\nI got news for you all, let me show you how to ball\nSee the legendary fall, I ain't heard of that\nY'all niggas is off the wall like Arsenio Hall\nI'mma put you right back where the dirt is at\n450 fahrenheit on the thermostat\nSomebody starvin' like a white girl, Bernadette\nBut she not a earner yet, she couldn't put in no work\nFor Nat Burner yet, the black microphone murder vet\nI'm in a class of my own\nIf I got beef with you, you the last one to know\nI arrive on time, I'm never fashionable\nYou late, I'm already international-able\nI done twirled in Berlin, banged in Beijing\nYou never seen nothin' can't say the same thing\nTell somebody Black Thought, yeah you know the name ring\nSo give him the game ring for bringin' what them niggas can't bring\nMy hustle is long, my muscle is strong\nMy man put the paper in the duffle I'm gone\nY'all still a light year from the level I'm on\nJust a pawn steppin' right into the head of the storm\nYou been warned, I will blow y'all niggas and disintegrate\nI'm a rebel, renegade must stay paid"}}, {"title": "Act Fore...

I hit em wit a portion\nSon, The Fifth foursome, armed at the door son\nM-illi-tilla, Dice Raw, quick draw son\nYou don't want no more son? That's when more come\nAnd drag a nigga Erie Avenue to Oregon, you're all done\nLadies and gentlemen\nSelect the weapon at the gate upon entering, The Roots instrumentaling\nSpark shit, them niggas try to talk shit\nWe hit em like the L at 60th and Market\nSouth Philly clip a hole into a nigga pocket\nTake sneaks, chains and rings and bracelets\nSplit back this like we the therapist\nAdrenaline, Fifth mic terrorist, once again\n (x2)\nOnce again 'gain\nOnce again 'gain\nOnce again 'gain 'gain ladies and gentlemen\nOnce again 'gain\nOnce again 'gain\nOnce again 'gain 'gain\nYo, Adrenaline\n\nZigga zigga zigga tryin to get a grip but still slip, so lift me up\nEver since I was a pup I was designed to erupt\nYou get to know me, you poke me slowly, when caught puzzin\nSome niggas thought they was, when of course they wasn't\nPunked em wit a dozen of pellets all in they skelet\nTransform, from the norm, start to brainstorm\nYeah Malik B from The Roots, he ain't gone\nI took the wrong exit, the sign said Langhorne\nI'm trapped up in about five worlds with live pearls\nShouts to Armour Akquan whose name is Jalil\nThe moat is deep water so let your hand expand it\nDemanding, takin you back like Knotts Landing\nI'm Ralph Kramden, we out, you'll see in Hampton\nYo what the what the what the, what the what the what the\nPivot on this concrete earth until I rot\nDidn't figure how to conquer it yet but still I plot, once again\n (x2)\nOnce again 'gain\nOnce again 'gain\nOnce again 'gain 'gain ladies and gentlemen\nOnce again 'gain\nOnce again 'gain\nOnce

you know who the bosses is\nNorth Philly baby, that's where that Raw shit is\nYou'll get blown out the sky once shit get talkative\nA-D devise rise, I fathered it\nSo when you see me on the street, don't bother kid\nJust be on your merry way, or you might get slit\nAsk around, wondering what Dice Raw did\nLay you on floors like ya getting carpeted\nYou need a special kind of mic for retarded kids\nMe against you's like Kane verse the Partridges\nYou wanna battle, change your name to The Forfeiters\nCuz that's what you do, face to face wit raw niggas\nI give you a bad case of the fucked-up

talk shit, but I'ma quiet them\nKick in the door wit my boys stick to rioting\nFirst nigga that flinch, I'mma fire em\nTape em up, grip his hands, and plier em\nKnow the bricks is in here, where you hiding em?\nDon't die in the shit that you lying in\nUsed to get fronted bricks, now I'm buying em\nUsed to cop off my man, now I'm supplying him\nPaid the front row seat watching Iverson\nFirst class air crafts what I'm flying in\nTo L.A., Shaq, Eddie, Kobe Bryant and them\nSave the jokes for Chris Tucker, Richard Pryor and them\nUsed to shotgun in cars, now I'm driving em\nUsed to hustle 'round

What's it all for?\nWith knowledge of yourself, then you're through the first door\nMy people hungry and thirst for more next music explore\nIt's heavenly to your ebony daughter next door\nSo what you think The Roots get the world respect for?\nThe splendid authentic hip-hop that's raw core\nSevere, world premier, a superior sophomore\nNo doubt, wherever you dwell, that's where the bomb fell\nExplodin from the imperial en-sem-ble, for real\nFrom the ven-ue to the avenue\nWe truly only got respect for a few, y'all ain't sayin nuttin new\n\nNuttin new, nuttin new, y'all not sayin nuttin new\nRepresent the legendary Fifth Dynasty crew\nRoots crew comin through, tell me what you could do\nYo you lookin for me?

trippin not a Bobby Brown, lippin with my nose runnin\nBasically I had two, options I just chose one\nAnd then got ghost, like my picture was on a most wanted\nCoast to coast, from L.A. to

satisfaction\nHe out late nights, probably smashing\nLeaving a trail like trolley tracks\nOr the train on the ground, downtown Manhattan\nEverybody seen him run around and you bound to catch him\nThe

hundred dollar suit\n(stop being a backseat driver man)\n(turn him up)\n\nYour ma don't like to jitterbug, said this unholy music\nHip hop just so ridiculous, everything sounds so confusing\nNowadays ain't nothing like it was, one thing that showed the blues\nIs this system so mysterious, can't let that stop the movement\nCan't get no satisfaction, they all laughing, glad it's happening\nAll ringside for the main attraction\nActing a fool with a lust for action\nYoung girl caught in a crime of passion\nSitting there crying in designer fashion\nDidn't blow, didn't have time for asking\n\"Somebody call for the ambulances\", girl\n\nBaby, baby, baby\nBaby let me live, please girl let me slide\nBaby, baby, baby\nBaby if you let me go, I swear I'll change, just change your mind\n\nYour old man don't like to jitterbug, said this old dirty music\nHip hop just so ridiculous, them stories too confusing\nNowadays he ain't loving you like he was\nAnd you ain't there just for using\nCould have sworn that was him with another girl\nAnd they wasn't out just for cruising\nCan't get no satisfaction\nHe out late nights, probably smashing\nLeaving a trail like trolley tracks\nOr the train on the ground, downtown Manhattan\nEverybody seen him run around and you bound to catch him\nThe condoms, you found and asked him, was all this just for practice?\nHe didn't realize what he had\nNow your heart got fractured, girl\n\nBaby, baby, baby\nBaby, baby, baby"}}, {"title": "Becoming Unwritten", "album": "Rising Down", "year": null, "lyrics": "{*31 seconds of instrumental*}\n\nThe

Kelly gutter smut peddlers\nInternet predators, chat-room irregulars\nThis not my twist, you tryna send me to the therapist, miss\n\n\nNow, she told me cheddar cheese grits, two tomato fried fish\nCause she heard it's my dish, tryna be my sidekick\nAll the people all around thinkin she was my chick\nSayin, \"Damn, the girl thick, but she ain't no twenty-six\"\nLookin at me like I'm up to sum'him on the funny tip\nLike I ever really been the one to try the honey drip\nIt's your birthday so let me know the gift you wanna get\nIn fact, blow out the candles on the cake and make a wish for me\n\nThey can't really seem to look away\nSo they try, asking her to stay\nFake I.D., you won't get turned away!\nYou look, lovely toniiiight...\nNow you're old enough to buy a gun\nSo many better

\"R\"-rated show, now\n\"R\"-rated show\n\nYo, she said she was a magazine editor named, Janine\nBackstage in high-heels and painted-on, jeans\nProbably had the most, devious eyes I'd ever seen\nTold me she was twenty-two, she was only seventeen\nShe had sum'hin to hide she snuck in from out-side\nAnd got, everybody gassed like the car I, drive\nWith all that grown-lady ass and my far-out, vibe\nShe said she came to see them Roots boys +Fall-Out+ live, but listen...\n\n\nYou see the girls look good, but they brains not ready\nI talk to a woman, her mind is mo', steady\nProbably sum'hin in the way they designed, that's mo' steady\nI just let you inside cause the line so, heavy\nBut I shoulda know, better cause now I feel like America's\nUnderbelly R. Kelly gutter smut peddlers\nInternet predators, chat-room irregulars\nThis not my twist, you tryna send me to the therapist, miss\n\n\nNow, she told me cheddar cheese grits, two tomato fried fish\nCause she heard it's my dish, tryna be my sidekick\nAll the people all around thinkin she was my chick\nSayin, \"Damn, the girl thick, but she ain't no twenty-six\"\nLookin at me like I'm up to sum'him on the funny tip\nLike I ever really been the one to try the honey drip\nIt's your birthday so let me know the gift you wanna get\nIn fact, blow out the candles on the cake and make a wish for me\n\nThey can't really seem to look away\nSo they try, asking her to stay\nFake I.D., you won't get turned away!\nYou look, lovely toniiiight...\nNow you're old enough to buy a gun\nSo many better ways of having fun\nRight now I can only think of one...\nYou look lovely toniiiight..."}}, {"title": "Bittersweet Side A", "album": null, "year": "2016-08-03", "lyrics": "It all goes down sweet till the bitter end\n(Till the bitter end, till the bitter end)\nLet's have a ball y'all, let's get it in\n(Let's get it in, let's get it in)\nIt all goes down sweet till the bitter end\n(Till the bitter end, till the bitter end)\nLet's have a ball y'all, let's get it in\n(Let's get it in, let's get it in)\nAnd if it feels good baby just let me know\n(Let me know, let me know)\nAnd if it feels good baby just let me know\n(Let me know, let me know)\nI wanna do it for ya, I wanna do it for ya\nI wanna do it for ya, I wanna do it for ya\nI wanna do it for ya, I wanna do it for ya\nI wanna do it for ya, I wanna do it for ya\n\nYeah, through the streets we parade like a second line\nGame face, we charade hard to recognise\nLyrical we only set aside for better times\nPut the roses in the vase while the guests arrive\nSomething for the repertoire, that was kept in mind\nAt the tip of my tongue if I could just describe\nUnforgettable what Stella Artois provides\nTrue bittersweet place that it occupies\nLife's too short to embrace the brevity\nIt's a moment in time, why waste or bury it?\nImage isn't anything but taste is everything\nEvery legendary when I create the recipe\nI don't only make music, I make history\nWhile I show the whole world love unconditionally\nIcon against the harmonic symphony\nYou witnessing the definition of chemistry\n\nIt all goes down sweet till the bitter end\n(Till the bitter end, till the bitter end)\nLet's have a ball y'all, let's get it in\n(Let's get it in, let's get it in)\nIt all goes down sweet till the bitter end\n(Till the bitter end, till the bitter end)\nLet's have a ball y'all, let's get it in\n(Let's get it in, let's get it in)\nAnd if it feels good baby just let me know\n(Let me know, let me know)\nAnd if it feels good baby just let me know\n(Let me know, let me know)\nI wanna do it for ya, I wanna do it for ya\nI wanna do it for ya, I wanna do it for ya\nI wanna do it for ya, I wanna do it for ya\nI wanna do it for ya, I wanna do it for ya\n\nYeah, we put in work but when it's finished then it's leisure\nI hear color, taste sound -

all goes down sweet till the bitter end\n(Till the bitter end, till the bitter end)\nLet's have a ball y'all, let's get it in\n(Let's get it in, let's get it in)\nIt all goes down sweet till the bitter end\n(Till the bitter end, till the bitter end)\nLet's have a ball y'all, let's get it in\n(Let's get it in, let's get it in)\nAnd if it feels good baby just let me know\n(Let me know, let me

it for ya\nI wanna do it for ya, I wanna do it for ya\n\nYeah, through the streets we parade like a second line\nGame face, we charade hard to recognise\nLyrical we only set aside for better times\nPut the roses in the vase while the guests arrive\nSomething for the repertoire, that was kept in mind\nAt the tip of my tongue if I could just describe\nUnforgettable what Stella Artois provides\nTrue bittersweet place that it occupies\nLife's too short to embrace the brevity\nIt's a moment in time, why waste or bury it?\nImage isn't anything but taste is everything\nEvery legendary when I create the recipe\nI don't only make music, I make history\nWhile I show the whole world love unconditionally\nIcon against the harmonic symphony\nYou witnessing the definition of chemistry\n\nIt all goes down sweet till the bitter end\n(Till the bitter end, till the bitter end)\nLet's have a ball y'all, let's get it in\n(Let's get it in, let's get it in)\nIt all goes down sweet till the bitter end\n(Till the bitter end, till the bitter end)\nLet's have a ball y'all, let's get it in\n(Let's get it in, let's get it in)\nAnd if it feels good baby just let me know\n(Let me know, let me know)\nAnd if it feels good baby just let me know\n(Let me know, let me know)\nI wanna do it for ya, I wanna do it for ya\nI wanna do it for ya, I wanna do it for ya\nI wanna do it for ya, I wanna do it for ya\nI wanna do it for ya, I wanna do it for ya\n\nYeah, we put in work but when it's finished then it's leisure\nI hear color, taste sound - synesthesia\nIt's complicated to break down, then it's easure\nOf your weight round, you sure to be replenished\nBy the five different scientific measurements of seeds\nThen that'll work with, come get your thirst quenched\nI'm a craftsman with the tools in my workbench\nWell I'ma play by the rules and bud this surface\nThe only limit is the sky, no ceiling\nOne thing's for sure, it's I know feeling\nWhat doesn't feel right's what I won't deal in\nIf it's airtight then it's worthy of a seal\nAnd you know it's a real one, that's when we in the building\nOpen the fence, pop the top on a chill one\nI started as a trendsetter and I'm still one\nSo for the love and support thanks a million\n\nIt all goes down sweet till the bitter end\n(Till the bitter end, till the bitter end)\nLet's have a ball y'all, let's get it in\n(Let's get it in, let's get it in)\nIt all goes down sweet till the bitter end\n(Till the bitter end, till the bitter end)\nLet's have a ball y'all, let's get it in\n(Let's get it in, let's get it in)\nAnd if it feels good baby just let me know\n(Let me know, let me know)\nAnd if it feels good baby just let me know\n(Let me know, let me know)\nI wanna do it for ya, I wanna do it for ya\nI wanna

twist like a ratchet in an auto shop\nSince granddaddy old Desoto stopped and he got the Caddie\nI been gladly servin, any y'all cats wanna act determined\nSpit pesticides for rats and vermin\nSeem like none of y'all chumps is learning\nY'all hopeless, and I'm a little better than dopest\nFar from a brand new kid to show biz\nTryna hold on, maintain my focus\nComing out the room with a cloud of smoke of dro and\nWith the punches\nI survive and rock\nCause I keep the crowd alive\nAnd the texture of my voice\nIs course and kind of hoarse and cut\nLike I'm throwing a thousand knives\n\nParty people gather round what we have here is a brand new sound\nReach for my waist you hit the ground\nYou better duck when that awful sound goes\nBoom\nThats what's happenin in the parking lot\nThats whats happenin on stage\n\nThe man at hand that rule the school\nAnd reach and teach the blind and find a way from A to Z\nAnd be the most to boast I'm load and proud\nThe game and reign that remain\nThe heat is on so feel the fire come off the empire or the\nMore higher level of depth one step beyond dope\nTo suckers all scope and hope to cope but nope\nCause I could never let 'em on top of me\nI play 'em out like a game of Monopoly\nLet it speed around the board like an Astro\nThen send 'em to jail for trying to pass Go\nShaking 'em up, breaking 'em up, taking no stuff\nBut it still ain't loud enough\nSo Questlove let the fire roast\nSo I can flow and we can kill the whole show cause\n\n\nI'm live\nDesign a finer rhyme that's right on time\nOne step beyond and not behind the line\nThat seperates thought from divine\nYou can take it as a caution, or a warning sign\nLook for antonyms, words I'm sending em\nHomonyms, synonyms good like M&Ms\nYou know the time when it's Riq Gees slicing\nI turn a Mic's last name into Tyson\nMy brain like a factory constantly creating\nMaterials stitch by stitch for decoration\nMy lyrics one fabric the beat is a lining\nMy passion of rhyming is fashion designing\nNow it get sorted cause people wanna sport it ya bought it\nIf you didn't then you couldn't afford it\nPoetry full of surprises it's like a game show\nAnd my brain go\nI do my thing yo"}}, {"title": "Bread and Butter", "album": "Game Theory", "year": "2006-08-29", "lyrics": "Yeah, through the sirens, the lights is blinding\nBattle cries sound off, warriors dying\nLast call at the bar for snakes and tyrants\nHands up, that's a massacre the cops kept firing\nRun amok, keep y'all eternally crying\nFed up, place red stains on global giants\nThe brain of an Orson Welles\nStuck in a masterpiece, Citizen Kane's personal hell\nIt's done, and it's hot where them hustlers dwell\nAnd the air bears the stench of a corpse's smell\nHomie down on his luck one foot in the jail\nAnd he down to his last with a quarter to sell\nThis right here, world premiere of the last days\nThe final paragraphs to the book's last page\nYou could feel it coming, no running away\nLet's get free or let's get paid\nSame shit different day\nThe cornerstone to where I lay\nIt's shattered glass and crack bags where they play\nAnd scattered ass is passed in ridiculous ways\nThese cats Chef like they Isaac Hayes\nParallel to the grave\nStuck in the game with no rules\nAnd we screaming for some water and some edible food\nMan I'm right there, rabbit ears, nothing to lose\nThis is what you ain't learning in school\nI'm trying to tell you it's hard\n\nA loaf of bread, milk and eggs, stick of butter man\nSomebody's mother lies dead in the gutter\nSheriff down by them heads, talking that Gullah\nTell the kids don't look under those covers, man \n\nCheck it out\nA child is born, his mother is gone\nHe in the middle of it literally, tussling strong\nFor his life, the tide high in the eye of the storm\nA mannish boy arrive and the riot is on\nWith no spare time to try to respond\nOr prepare times, it's hard not becoming a headline\nOr praying in the night when it's bedtime\nOr laying your head down\nCuz you already know what it is now\nYou know a lot of leaders ain't honest\nAnd they can't keep a promise\nAnd I hate to speak about it but it's all freakanomics\nCramped and proud of it, you amped and you rowdy\nTreading water trying to lift up your head without drowning\nThis type of shit can make your heart stop pounding\nBut you pushing for the top, too scared to stop\nNow it gets deep, bodies are floating around in the streets\nLot of people who won't even be around in a week\nMan, get the operation gone, what y'all waiting on?\nWe been patient, y'all mo'fuckas taking long\nThe television getting all the information wrong\nDoing how they do it getting they mis-education on\nThey already late\nSomebody been was 'posed to regulate\nInstead of wait before they let the levee break\nYou try running from the truth but it's giving chase\nI got to ask myself,yo, is any nigga safe?", "image":

dying\nLast call at the bar for snakes and tyrants\nHands up, that's a massacre the cops kept firing\nRun amok, keep y'all eternally crying\nFed up, place red stains on global giants\nThe brain of an Orson Welles\nStuck in a masterpiece, Citizen Kane's personal hell\nIt's done, and it's hot where them hustlers dwell\nAnd the air bears the stench of a corpse's smell\nHomie down on his luck one foot in the jail\nAnd he down to his last with a quarter to sell\nThis right here, world premiere of the last days\nThe final paragraphs to the book's last page\nYou could feel it coming, no running away\nLet's get free or let's get paid\nSame shit different day\nThe cornerstone to where I lay\nIt's shattered glass and crack bags where they play\nAnd scattered ass is passed in ridiculous ways\nThese cats Chef like they Isaac Hayes\nParallel to the grave\nStuck in the game with no rules\nAnd we screaming for some water and some edible food\nMan I'm right there, rabbit ears, nothing to lose\nThis is what you ain't learning in school\nI'm trying to tell you it's hard\n\nA loaf of bread, milk and eggs, stick of butter man\nSomebody's mother lies dead in the gutter\nSheriff down by them heads, talking that Gullah\nTell the kids don't look under those covers, man \n\nCheck it out\nA child is born, his mother is gone\nHe in the middle of it literally, tussling strong\nFor his life, the tide high in the eye of the storm\nA mannish boy arrive and the riot is on\nWith no spare time to try to respond\nOr prepare times, it's hard not becoming a headline\nOr praying in the night when it's bedtime\nOr laying your head down\nCuz you already know what it is now\nYou know a lot of leaders ain't honest\nAnd they can't keep a promise\nAnd I hate to speak about it but it's all freakanomics\nCramped and proud of it, you amped and you rowdy\nTreading water trying to lift up your head without drowning\nThis type of shit can make your heart stop pounding\nBut you pushing for the top, too scared to stop\nNow it gets deep, bodies are floating around in the streets\nLot of people who won't even be around in a week\nMan, get the operation gone, what y'all waiting on?\nWe been patient, y'all mo'fuckas taking long\nThe television getting all the information wrong\nDoing how they do it getting they mis-education on\nThey already late\nSomebody been was 'posed to regulate\nInstead of wait before they let the levee break\nYou try running from the truth but it's giving chase\nI got to ask myself,yo, is any nigga safe?"}}, {"title": "Break You Off", "album":

ain't suppose to be involved\nKnowing when we get it off, Girl I mean it all\nKeeping you fiending 'til you taking it tossed\nAnd when I'm breaking it off\nIts no denying the fact it's wrong\nCause you got a man who's probably playing his part\nYou probably breaking his heart\nHe trying to figure the reason you gon'\nIs it because he's superficial\nOr is he too submissive\nOr did I come along and hit you with the futuristic\nOr is it cause you really couldn't see a future with him\nAll he about is paper, never took the time with you to listen\nYou want it gripped up, flipped, and thrown\nAnd get stripped and shown, the way to get in the zone\nThe cost, dealing with this you won't be takin' a loss\nYou need to leave him alone\nAnd roll with the one who's breaking you off\n\nI'm

baby\n\nBrother down the hall\nThe one you bound to call\nWorkaholic so really I'm rarely around at all\nWhat we started got serious repercussions in court\nWe had a chance to turn back, but love that was long\nLate nights, twistin' somethin' listenin' to niecey sing\nShe got the beefy, you tellin' me you deeply appreciate the company\nThe time we spend 'I feel the same; It's a shame you ain't my girlfriend'\nCause listen: you need a brother with that physical fix\nThat come through in a mix for you with no head tricks or fraud\nYou need a new position, somethin' to get you open like its Eucalyptus got you ready to go for your's\nCome on and work wit' meh', you won't get hurt wit' meh': Just keep it real and you'll get broken off certainleh' (certainly)\nDealing with this you won't be takin' a loss; you need to leave I'm alone and roll with the one whose breakin' you off\n\nI'm coming to break you off (beat started.....start-started..)\nI'm coming to break you off (beat started.....start-started..)\nI'm coming to break you off (beat started.....start-started..)\nYeah baby\n\nRollin' down the highway, listenin' to Sade sing the way the smooth operator move my way\nYou sitting beside me\nLooking like Friday Foster\nPam Grier structure look at your body\nKeep each other thirsty\nKisses like Hershey\nBut lips is sealed\nCause we don't need the controversy\nI say I'm in town, You say you want it in the worst way\nYou probably told your man it was your it was ya lil's birthday\nMeanwhile, Its champagne chilling in ice\nYou ready for the freakiest things you done in ya life?\nWe breaking down like we Road dogs pullin' a heist\nYou making sounds like the vibe got you reaching your heights\nPrepare for flight, this is your captain\nI'm getting strapped in\nTheres no denying the strength\nOf'dis attraction girl\nWorking with this you won't be taking a loss\nSo stop fooling your man and roll with the one\nWho's breaking you off\n\nBaby, Baby, Baby... don't you

like Hershey\nBut lips is sealed cuz we don't need a controversy\nI say I'm in town, you say you want it in the worst way?\nYou probably told your man it was your mother's birthday\nMeanwhile it's champagne chillin in ice\nYou ready for the freakiest things you've done in your life\nWe break it down like road dogs pulling a heist\nYou makin sounds like the vibe gotcha reaching your height\nPrepare for flight, this is your captain I'm getting strapped in\nThere's no denying the strength that it's attraction - girl\nWorking with this you won't be taking a loss\nSo stop fooling your man\nAnd roll with the one who's breaking you off\n\nBaby, baby, baby... Don't you worry bout (no babe)\nNothing cuz I'm comin to...\nHandle you no doubt\nWhenever you want that thing you need (I got it)\nAnd then I aim to please\nI'm coming over to give it to you babe (babe)"}}, {"title": "Can't Stop This", "album": "Game Theory", "year": "2006-08-29", "lyrics": "{\"Saved Message. Today at 5.47 PM\"}\n\"My man, JD, was a true hip hop artist\n... I can't explain the influence that\nHis mind and ear have had on my band\nMyself and the careers of so many other\nArtists. The most humble, modest, worthy\nAnd gifted beatmaker I've known. And\nDefinitely the best producer on the mic\nNever without that signature smile and head\nBouncin' to the beat. JD had a passion for\nLife and music, and will never be forgotten\nHe's a brother that was loved by me, and I\nLove what he's done for us. And though I'm\nHappy he's no longer in the pain he'd been\nRecently feelin', I'm crushed by the pain of\nHis absence. Name's Dilla Dog and I can only\nRep the real and raw.

The most humble, modest, worthy\nAnd gifted beatmaker I've known. And\nDefinitely the best producer on the mic\nNever without that signature smile and head\nBouncin' to the beat. JD had a passion for\nLife and music, and will never be forgotten\nHe's a brother that was loved by me, and I\nLove what he's done for us. And though I'm\nHappy he's no longer in the pain he'd been\nRecently feelin', I'm crushed by the pain of\nHis absence. Name's Dilla Dog and I can only\nRep the real and raw.

Player get involved\nNah, you work hard 'til you're better off\n24/7, 365, never off\nLook at me, I'm nocturnal, I don't sleep\nMy eyes heavy, bags and crow's feet\nBut I won't be stopped I go from tragedy to majesty\nThe victory has been woven into my tapestry\nMy adversary's not cut from the same flag as me\nThat's why the champion's gonna be who it has be\nThis ain't the type of opportunity that just appeared\nI made it here because I shed blood sweat and tears\nForget the title, I forever have my sights on\nThis is where I become an American Icon\n\nIf you a champion, show me you a champion\nIf you a champion, show me you a champion\nCause real champions move like champions\nAnd real champions prove that they're champions\nIf you a champion, show me you a champion\nIf you a champion, show me you a champion\nCause real champions move like champions\nAnd real champions prove that they're champions\n\nListen, forward motion never fail\nI learn to hustle, it's part of a cautionary tail\nHard work is something I know very well\nA lesson in a blessing out of each and every L, I ball\nI fell in love with the game and never look back\nMy foundation and frame, they never shook that\nBeen trailblazing my name into the book that\nRepresent all the champs who had a chance and took that\nAnd laser focus is the reoccurring theme\nForever coming to me like a reoccurring dream\nIf we weren't kings, we'd probably be swimming up stream\nTryna make the devil come clean for the umpteenth\nYou know me as the global dean from the noble team\nSo convene and the whole regime shall be overseen\nI'm a pillar like a column in the Pantheon\nCompetition I can't see 'em, I'm champion\n\nIf you a champion, show me you a champion\nIf you a champion, show me you a champion\nCause real champions move like champions\nAnd real champions prove that they're champions\nIf you a champion, show me you a champion\nIf you a champion, show me you a champion\nCause real champions move like champions\nAnd real champions prove that they're champions\n\nI'm gon' prove that I'm the champion\nAnd if there's something I can't do, then it can't be done\nAnd I ain't saying I don't lose, I'm saying I'm the only one\nAnd if it's either I or you, you best believe there's only gon' be one...true champion\n\nIf you a champion, show me you a champion\nIf you a champion, show me you a

strong that obstacles like failure and loss only act as motivation\nI mean like, no one has the power to shatter your dreams unless you give it to them\n\nWhen something's telling me to stop, I never do that in the name of love\nUntil I've given it my all and it just ain't enough\nSee even if it's getting realer than they say it was\nStraighten up, who's afraid of what? Player get involved\nNah, you work hard 'til you're better off\n24/7, 365, never off\nLook at me, I'm nocturnal, I don't sleep\nMy eyes heavy, bags and crow's feet\nBut I won't be stopped I go from tragedy to majesty\nThe victory has been woven into my tapestry\nMy adversary's not cut from the same flag as me\nThat's why the champion's gonna be who it has be\nThis ain't the type of opportunity that just appeared\nI made it here because I shed blood sweat and tears\nForget the title, I forever have my sights on\nThis is where I become an American Icon\n\nIf you a champion, show me you a champion\nIf you a champion, show me you a champion\nCause real champions move like champions\nAnd real champions prove that they're champions\nIf you a champion, show me you a champion\nIf you a champion, show me you a champion\nCause real champions move like champions\nAnd real champions prove that they're champions\n\nListen, forward motion never fail\nI learn to hustle, it's part of a cautionary tail\nHard work is something I know very well\nA lesson in a blessing out of each and every L, I ball\nI fell in love with the game and never look back\nMy foundation and frame, they never shook that\nBeen trailblazing my name into the book that\nRepresent all the champs who had a chance and took that\nAnd laser focus is the reoccurring theme\nForever coming to me like a reoccurring dream\nIf we weren't kings, we'd probably be swimming up stream\nTryna make the devil come clean for the umpteenth\nYou know me as the global dean from the noble team\nSo convene and the whole regime shall be overseen\nI'm a pillar like a column in the Pantheon\nCompetition I can't see 'em, I'm champion\n\nIf you a champion, show me you a champion\nIf you a champion, show me you a champion\nCause real champions move like champions\nAnd real champions prove that they're champions\nIf you a champion, show me you a champion\nIf you a champion, show me you a champion\nCause real champions move like champions\nAnd real champions prove that they're champions\n\nI'm gon' prove that I'm the champion\nAnd if there's something I can't do, then it can't be done\nAnd I ain't saying I don't lose, I'm saying I'm the only one\nAnd if it's either I or you, you best believe there's only gon' be one...true champion\n\nIf you a champion, show me you a champion\nIf you a champion, show me you a champion\nCause real champions move like champions\nAnd real champions prove that they're champions\nIf you a champion, show me you a champion\nIf you a champion, show me you a champion\nCause real champions move like champions\nAnd real champions prove that they're champions\nIf you a champion, show me you a champion\nIf you a champion, show me you a champion\nCause real champions move like champions\nAnd real champions prove that they're champions\nIf you a champion, show me you a champion\nIf you a champion, show me you a champion\nCause real champions move like champions\nAnd real champions prove that they're champions"}}, {"title": "Clock with No Hands", "album": "Game Theory", "year": "2006-08-29", "lyrics": "Yeah, sitting in the staircase, holding back tears\nLooking over mad years worth of photographs\nPictures of some places I ain't never going back\nSome people I used to love, why I ain't show them that?\nThe skies was overcast, when I was sober last\nMy head is spinning, couldn't tell you if it's slow or fast\nIt's starting to get too clear, I got to go and grab\nTo y'all it's a shame but life is what we know it as\nWaiting, navigating the plot, without plans\nIn the cards, it's hard to read as a clock with no hands\nHow your mans gonna get up his stock with no yams\nAll it take is one break, it could pop the program\nWhether sinning or not, my back bending like I'm sendin' salaat\nI feel some brothers is beginning to plot\nIt might have been a close friend I forgot\nWho started up and ain't remember to stop\nI bet these niggas going remember the shop\n\nPeople think that I'm crazy, just cause I wanna be alone\nYou can't depend on friends to help you in a squeeze\nWe all deal with shit on our own\nAnd sometimes the beef can grow, get out of hand\nYeah, you know it gets full blown\nI never said that you mean the world to me\nMaybe it's best that you never know\n\nYo, I'm like Malcom out the window with the weapon out\nSearching for somehow to find a minute or the second now\nPrecious time is money that I ain't got to mess about\nNeed it from the horse's mouth or from an eyewitness account\nLessons with my back to the wall, scoping my session out\nStay a little edgy at times when I ain't stressing bout\nHaters don't know shit about me, they the ones that talk shit\nThose that love me send it out, so I ain't got to force quit\nCause I'm doing better now, don't mean I never lost shit\nI was married to a state of mind and I divorced it, man\nI'm from where brothers moving product from the porches\nPeople locking their doors, clutching to their crosses\nThe block hot by the law, there ain't too many choices\nSo what I do is for y'all, there ain't too many voices left\nI watch my back, and watch my step\nAnd I might forgive, but I do not forget, come on\n\n\nYo, living in turbulent times\nThe blind leading the blind\nSome call it evolution, some say intelligent design\nYou say you want a revolution, you out of your mizind\nYour sons' destitute, and their pops all in the prison\nMy man's back in the jam, he like the back of my hand\nHe just attracted to scam, he right back in the can\nI never sleepwalk when you dead\nYou get your shuteye\nI'm on the first thing in, I'm leaving on the red-eye\nMy brother back in rehab, just had another relapse\nWithin himself, it's been like he's been fighting an inner Jihad\nTelling me ain't nobody true when they pretend to be that\nSo closer than friends, that's where I keep my enemy at\nTo any parties concerned, it's time to live it and learn\nUntil we're able to grow, forever bridges we burn\nMy thoughts free as a bird, that's just about to emerge\nAnd every action is heard, it speaks louder than words, yo", "image":

years worth of photographs\nPictures of some places I ain't never going back\nSome people I used to love, why I ain't show them that?\nThe skies was overcast, when I was sober last\nMy head is spinning, couldn't tell you if it's slow or fast\nIt's starting to get too clear, I got to go and grab\nTo y'all it's a shame but life is what we know it as\nWaiting, navigating the plot, without plans\nIn the cards, it's hard to read as a clock with no hands\nHow your mans gonna get up his stock with no yams\nAll it take is one break, it could pop the program\nWhether sinning or not, my back bending like I'm sendin' salaat\nI feel some brothers is beginning to plot\nIt might have been a close friend I forgot\nWho started up and ain't remember to stop\nI bet these niggas going remember the shop\n\nPeople think that I'm crazy, just cause I wanna be alone\nYou can't depend on friends to help you in a squeeze\nWe all deal with shit on our own\nAnd sometimes the beef can grow, get out of hand\nYeah, you know it gets full blown\nI never said that you mean the world to me\nMaybe it's best that you never know\n\nYo, I'm like Malcom out the window with the weapon out\nSearching for somehow to find a minute or the second now\nPrecious time is money that I ain't got to mess about\nNeed it from the horse's mouth or from an eyewitness account\nLessons with my back to the wall, scoping my session out\nStay a little edgy at times when I ain't stressing bout\nHaters don't know shit about me, they the ones that talk shit\nThose that love me send it out, so I ain't got to force quit\nCause I'm doing better now, don't mean I never lost shit\nI was married to a state of mind and I divorced it, man\nI'm from where brothers moving product from the porches\nPeople locking their doors, clutching to their crosses\nThe block hot by the law, there ain't too many choices\nSo what I do is for y'all, there ain't too many voices left\nI watch my back, and watch my step\nAnd I might forgive, but I do not forget, come on\n\n\nYo, living in turbulent times\nThe blind leading the blind\nSome call it evolution, some say intelligent design\nYou say you want a revolution, you out of your mizind\nYour sons' destitute, and their pops all in the prison\nMy man's back in the jam, he like the back of my hand\nHe just attracted to scam, he right back in the can\nI never sleepwalk when you dead\nYou get your shuteye\nI'm on the first thing in, I'm leaving on the red-eye\nMy brother back in rehab, just had another relapse\nWithin himself, it's been like he's been fighting an inner Jihad\nTelling me ain't nobody true when they pretend to be that\nSo closer than friends, that's where I keep my enemy at\nTo any parties concerned, it's time to live it and learn\nUntil we're able to grow, forever bridges we burn\nMy thoughts free as a bird, that's just about to emerge\nAnd every action is heard, it speaks louder than words, yo"}}, {"title": "Clones", "album": "Illadelph

y'all\n\nThought's a Black miss you wanna catch the Crumbs\nWhen I hums a fat song, with derelicts and bums\nSmoke gems with the folk from the cellar when they come\nMouth be like cotton, got sticks of gum\nCommon spear-a-mint, it's like sense is Dust\nAccumulation much cause naps I got nuff\nFunk feeds the dome see the trees they wanna rise\nOut sprouts the ?, free to vocalize\nOld school highs I got, for your eyes\nCirculize never even though we lock together\nAsk the set I'm clever cause I'm severed and I'm pooped\nBut anyway the wind blows, the Dust you gotta go\nChorus\n\nIt's like

here\nShouldn't there be more?\nJust can't see more\n\nYou're physically in this, but how could we tell\nIf we was meant to be in bliss if you're not mentally as well?\nThis energy you're sending me is tricky as hell\nUsually it's like a 50/50, we could take a L\nBefore we start things, at this point being apart brings\nThe feeling of somebody plucking at your heart strings\nI know it probably shouldn't feel like this\nBut any other woman I see is in your likeness\nIt's from your cheekbones\nTo your lips, to your curves, to your deep moans\nTo that walk, to your words\nYou love feeling like a breakdown on the verge\nFirst we on good terms, then you on my last nerves\nGot my back just aching, my shoes is all tight\nIt's too complex when we choose to do it right\nIt's wrong, one minute you a soldier strong\nThen you trying a route talking about it's over and gone\n\nI've been wondering about the complexity\nOf what we have here\nShouldn't there be more?\nJust can't see more\nI've been wondering about the complexity\nOf what we have here\nShouldn't there be more?\nJust can't see more\n\nWhen your boyfriend's in town, it's bound to be trouble, love\nHis name Black, and he known to be a lover of\nGetting it on with my smoker's jacket on\nEyes racing back and forth listening to Chaka Khan\nTrying to figure the cause why you always acting off\nLike I'm slacking off\nMaybe our signal's getting crossed\nFor the case Love, you feel like you making a waste of\nYour precious time you need to get a taste of\nSome space to breathe, a moment as friends\nWe should've felt ourselves slipping into it again\nCuz it's like off and on, on and off\nPassion, lost and found, found and lost\nClashing, asking for nothing but understanding\nYour hearts made of glass, use care when handling\nGirl, all in all I never leave you stranded\nCuz my respect you commanded, you figure it out\n\nI've been wondering about the complexity\nOf what we have here\nShouldn't there be more?\nJust can't see more\nI've been wondering about the complexity\nOf what we have here\nShouldn't there be more?\nJust can't see more\n\nI used to come into the party and stand around\nCuz I was kinda too shy to really get down\nI used to play the corner and watch the scene\nDeep down knowing I wanted to find me a queen\nAnd I could feel that in my stomach and up in my chest\nBecause I knew a lot of women, and some was fresh\nBut then I found you girl, and just like me\nYou had a heart that was yearning to be set free\nNow listen, see you and me we need to take the time\nTo erase any doubt that's inside your mind\nIt's not a mountain that I'm ever too tired to climb\nAnd who's counting, but I know at least a thousand times\nI let you know I'm here for you, care for you, and confide in you\nBreak bread, share with you, and provide for you\nAnd that's full time, it's no 9 to 5 with you\nThat's why I'm trying to work it out with you, it's gonna work\n\nI've been wondering about the complexity\nOf what we have here\nShouldn't there be more?\nJust can't see more\nI've been wondering about the complexity\nOf what we have here\nShouldn't there be more?\nJust can't see more"}},

motto\nThat's all the fraud shit got to go/fake shit gots to go\n\nIn the glow of the moon, over the melancholy metro\nMy poetry is set like a U.F.O\nThe maestro, the lyricist concerto\nMy physical play the role of a vessel\nThe level of my lyrics law manifesto\nMy thoughts wrestle and attack with the killer instincts\nOf a gorilla stronger than Samson\nWithout Delilah, my soliloquy, profess, my ability to just\nStimulate you like the best sensimilla\nThe Halflife of Illadel-L-P-O-phila, proceed\nHithering is my death, I will blow your tower to smithe-\n-reens to fiends catch another rhyme river\nDeeper than the meditations of a Hindu worshiper\nUnorthodox, hip-hop minister\nThan a Serengeti cheetah, my thoughts swifter\nYou lose your balance when the sound hits ya\nSo check for the, Fifth Militia\nA poet's under pressure, stressing that you get the picture\nEven if it means you gotta hang over the banister\nI pull a microphone on any pistol brandisher\nAnd take advantage of ya crew because you're amateur\nStyles gunning down your sound man and manager\nWhat?? This how we do it in the year for nine-six\nWith this deliberate attack on pointless rap shit\nBreaking MC's down to fractions, tell your squadron\nIt's time to go to war, Respond/React\n - 2X\n\nThe implorer, the universe explorer\nTreat MC's like the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah\nLeaving these niggas open like a box of Pandora\nWith styles that's newer than the world order\nApproximately three quarters of y'all are water\nI straight deport ya\nThen orchestrate your torture with roots of culture\nThe pil-grimage to the line of scrimmage up against your image\nWhere life is a heist, where the strong get a percentage\nIt's ill as a war, and within, it I'm the Lieutenant\nThat surrounds you like a peninsula to snatch the pennant\nYou fold like Japan's futons and fans\nWhile I design a plan to make a rapper step like a pedestri-an\nI crush a mountain into grains of sand\nYour pain stains the hand that held the mic, inserted to the stand\nThe desperado, that refuse to follow\nThe Fifth aficionado, break you up into parts like vibrato\nI'm deep like the dark of the night\nNiggas is sweet and sound silly when they talk on the mic\nThey use the simple back and forth, the same\nOld rhythm that's plain\nI'd rather UltraMagnetize your brain\nIt's the hip-hop purist, that leave you lost like a tourist\nInside the chorus, niggas is bringing nothing for us\nAs we breaking em down to fractions, tell your squadron\nIt's time to go to war, Respond/React\n - 2X", "image": "https://images.genius.com/ee1be689768fec4b212a660587dcb05b.1000x1000x1.jpg", "artist": "The Roots", "raw":

know like I know then you know the motto\nThat's all the fraud shit got to go/fake shit gots to go\n\nIn the glow of the moon, over the melancholy metro\nMy poetry is set like a U.F.O\nThe maestro, the lyricist concerto\nMy physical play the role of a vessel\nThe level of my lyrics law manifesto\nMy thoughts wrestle and attack with the killer instincts\nOf a gorilla stronger than Samson\nWithout Delilah, my soliloquy, profess, my ability to just\nStimulate you like the best sensimilla\nThe Halflife of Illadel-L-P-O-phila, proceed\nHithering is my death, I will blow your tower to smithe-\n-reens to fiends catch another rhyme river\nDeeper than the meditations of a Hindu worshiper\nUnorthodox, hip-hop minister\nThan a Serengeti cheetah, my thoughts swifter\nYou lose your balance when the sound hits ya\nSo check for the, Fifth Militia\nA poet's under pressure, stressing that you get the picture\nEven if it means you gotta hang over the banister\nI pull a microphone on any pistol brandisher\nAnd take advantage of ya crew because you're amateur\nStyles gunning down your sound man and manager\nWhat?? This how we do it in the year for nine-six\nWith this deliberate attack on pointless rap shit\nBreaking MC's down to fractions, tell your squadron\nIt's time to go to war, Respond/React\n - 2X\n\nThe implorer, the universe explorer\nTreat MC's like the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah\nLeaving these niggas open like a box of Pandora\nWith styles that's newer than the world order\nApproximately three quarters of y'all are water\nI straight deport ya\nThen orchestrate your torture with roots of culture\nThe pil-grimage to the line of scrimmage up against your image\nWhere life is a heist, where the strong get a percentage\nIt's ill as a war, and within, it I'm the Lieutenant\nThat surrounds you like a peninsula to snatch the pennant\nYou fold like Japan's futons and fans\nWhile I design a plan to make a rapper step like a pedestri-an\nI crush a mountain into grains of sand\nYour pain stains the hand that held the mic, inserted to the stand\nThe desperado, that refuse to follow\nThe Fifth aficionado, break you up into parts like vibrato\nI'm deep like the dark of the night\nNiggas is sweet and sound silly when they talk on the mic\nThey use the simple back and forth, the same\nOld rhythm that's plain\nI'd rather UltraMagnetize your brain\nIt's the hip-hop purist, that leave you lost like a tourist\nInside the chorus, niggas is bringing nothing for us\nAs we breaking em down to fractions, tell your squadron\nIt's time to go to war, Respond/React\n - 2X"}}, {"title": "Criminal", "album": "Rising Down", "year": "2008-01-01", "lyrics": "Monday they predict the storm\nTuesday they predict the bang\nWednesday they cover the crash\nAnd I can see it's all about cash\nAnd they got the nerve to hunt down my ass\nAnd treat me like a criminal\n\nLook, it is what it is because of what it was\nI did what I did cause it does what it does\nI don't put nothing above what I am, what I love\nMy family, my blood, my city and my hood\nHater for the greater good, I'm back from Hollywood\nAnd I ain't changed a lick though I know I probably should\nBut what I'm doing is not a good look\nI never did it by the good book as a lifetime crook\nAll the petty crime took a toll on me\nI look around at my homies that's getting old on me\nBut still something gotta hold on me\nMaybe it's fate\nIf it's coming, yo I'm willing to wait\nI'm not running, I done ran through the muck\nI done scrambled and such\nI done robbed an odd jobbed and gambled enough\nUntil I'm put up in handcuffs and pissing in a cup\nIf there's a God, I don't know if he listening or what\n\n\nYeah, it is what it is\nAnd that's how it go\nGet treated like a criminal if crime is all you know\nGet greeted like a nigga if a nigga's all you show\nA public enemy that's in the eye of the scope\nMy city like a island where you can't find a boat\nHave you wishing for a raft\nAnd praying that hope floats\nSome real ethnic cleansing going down no soap\nWho looking for a chair and some real strong rope\nJust to end it all here\nScreaming \"fuck the mayor\"\nHe see the faces at the bottom of the well clear\nThey act like I'm something to fear\nTrapped in urban warfare\nAnd putting triggers ahead a college career\nCan't ignore the call of the wild\nThat's drawing them near\nTry to make fast money last long some years\nTry to laugh it off\nStill couldn't lose the tears\nTo the rules, I will not adhere\nBreak the law, yeah\n\n\nWho want to challenge mine?\nI'm sick of St. Valentine\nI did the violent crimes\nThat's why I got this style of rhyme\nSeek repentance to spitting them sentences that's senseless\nExperience is the difference, you can't convince this\nIn a crime sense, niggas is infants\nI'm like a senior citizen\nStill living but getting benefits\nPut emphasis on hitting my nemesis in high percentages\nCrooked ass cops is the reason for my belligerence\nAnd it gets deeper than that\nThere were nights I used to sleep with a gat\nWith a package of crack under my sneaker strap\nD's sneak attack, arraign me, it took a week for that\nBeat the rap, but you're saying \"look, he think he the mack\"\nFuck y'all!\nNiggas who thinking they might try us\nWatch us insight riots\nFlip cars and light fires\nWe already been knocked, scrutinized\nPlus cops rush to brutalize us\nAmerica is polluted by lust\nWho could I trust?\nIf I can't trust you, then I might touch you\nIf I ain't got love for you\nThen fuck you", "image": "https://images.genius.com/e415802f1331a049bcbf0af9916e51d9.500x500x1.jpg", "artist": "The Roots", "raw": {"annotation_count": 16,

lifetime crook\nAll the petty crime took a toll on me\nI look around at my homies that's getting old on me\nBut still something gotta hold on me\nMaybe it's fate\nIf it's coming, yo I'm willing to wait\nI'm not running, I done ran through the muck\nI done scrambled and such\nI done robbed an odd jobbed and gambled enough\nUntil I'm put up in handcuffs and pissing in a cup\nIf there's a God, I don't know if he listening or what\n\n\nYeah, it is what it is\nAnd that's how it go\nGet treated like a criminal if crime is all you know\nGet greeted like a nigga if a nigga's all you show\nA public enemy that's in the eye of the scope\nMy city like a island where you can't find a boat\nHave you wishing for a raft\nAnd praying that hope floats\nSome real ethnic cleansing going down no soap\nWho looking for a chair and some real strong rope\nJust to end it all here\nScreaming \"fuck the mayor\"\nHe see the faces at the bottom of the well clear\nThey act like I'm something to fear\nTrapped in urban warfare\nAnd putting triggers ahead a college career\nCan't ignore the call of the wild\nThat's drawing them near\nTry to make fast money last long some years\nTry to laugh it off\nStill couldn't lose the tears\nTo the rules, I will not adhere\nBreak the law, yeah\n\n\nWho want to challenge mine?\nI'm sick of St. Valentine\nI did the violent crimes\nThat's why I got this style of rhyme\nSeek repentance to spitting them sentences that's senseless\nExperience is the difference, you can't convince this\nIn a crime sense, niggas is infants\nI'm like a senior citizen\nStill living but getting benefits\nPut emphasis on hitting my nemesis in high percentages\nCrooked ass cops is the reason for my belligerence\nAnd it gets deeper than that\nThere were nights I used to sleep with a gat\nWith a package of crack under my sneaker strap\nD's sneak attack, arraign me, it took a week for that\nBeat the rap, but you're saying \"look, he think he the mack\"\nFuck y'all!\nNiggas who thinking they might try us\nWatch us insight riots\nFlip cars and light fires\nWe already been knocked, scrutinized\nPlus cops rush to brutalize us\nAmerica is polluted by lust\nWho could I trust?\nIf I can't trust you, then I might touch you\nIf I ain't got love for you\nThen fuck you"}}, {"title": "Dat Scat", "album": "The Roots From the Ground Up", "year": null, "lyrics": "Datskat!

question is if you don't love her what you fuckin' her for, nigga?\n\nShe wanna know if we can be together\nMan even if it ain't gon' be forever\nWell it can only be for one night\nThe only thing I ever loved in my life was the mic\nFucks the problem? dawg we mobbin'\nThe squad roll thicker than some hemoglobin\nI'll scare y'all quicker than a mean ol' goblin\nAin't no bullshit, me and my amigos

from the summer to sprang\nSpit game, get ya chick, make her leave wit the game\nWanna talk a little shit i'll make ya walk wit a cane\nGot 'em half steppin' like they walk wit cane\nHere I am, R-A-W, raw\nTruck North introducin' y'all\nThe way I slang game make ya dame insane\nI'm superman, not clark kent to lois lane\nI'm out for the paper, y'all out for the fame\nThere's five left in your

Why do we suffer?\n\nYeah, it's still me, one of your biggest fans\nI get off work, right back to work again\nI probably need to go ahead and have my head exam\nLook how they got me on the Def Jam payment plan\nWell, I'm in the world of entertainment and\nTrying to keep a singing man sane for the paying fans\nIf I don't make it through the night, slight change of plans\nHarp strings, angel wings and praying hands\nLord, forgive me for my shortcomings\nFor going on tour and ignoring the court summons\nAll I'm trying to do is live life to the fullest\nThey sent my daddy to you in a barrage of bullets\nWhy is the world ugly when you made it in your image?\nAnd why is living life such a fight to the finish?\nFor this high percentage, when the sky's the limit\nA second is a minute, every hour's infinite\n\nDear God, I'm trying hard to reach you\nDear God, I see your face in all I do\nSometimes, it's so hard to believe in...", "image": "https://images.genius.com/b05244cd035a0258a064922787c50099.500x500x1.jpg", "artist": "The Roots", "raw": {"annotation_count": 38, "api_path": "/songs/588", "description": {"dom": {"tag": "root", "children": [{"tag": "p", "children": ["A plea to the man upstairs.

banks to fill up\nI provide the static, a scratch to match, while you catch the vibe\nMost can play high-post, but yo, that don't mean shit\nBecause my clique will make a motherfucker sick\nI'll flips, redder than pork, comin' to New York to mix\n(It's Bob Power) With the snares and kicks to fix\nRhythmically, you got ta be, static-y\nMagically I appear, spark a L and drink a beer\nWith Air Smooth, takin' niggas loot with dice\nThen shoot, The Roots, poetic, courageously kinetic\nVagabond, versatile and various, trust rap styles\nOf mine are blunt, pain is in the mind, so I'm fine and five\nFoot seven, inches in height\nMy mission to strike mics and lighten your tights\nFrightening, like lightning\nFluorescent, incandescent, effervescently\nI represent, Foreign Objects and Ill Elements\nVery relevant, plus intelligently managin' matter\nThat's makin' tracks fatter, revolve around\nSaturn like rings and brings swings, when I sings with bass\nThen distort up in your face like mace\nBustin' your dreams like gats with loaded magazines\nI'm on the rap scene, repellin' fellas like a vaccine\nAs I, rocks from under, blunderin' I'm not, lyrically\nYa get, shot, get caught so distort with Thought, for real\nIt's the illest out the Phi, short for Philidelph-iada-fly\nMoney makin', move fakin', I isn't\nNiggas can not front, I'm poetically exquisite\nWicked, with the visit while you're wonderin', what is it?\nDig it, yo, my mellow, um, what up for the night?\n(Malik B., get on the mic, get on the mic)\nLike that y'all, and yo I'm flowin', my part of the song\nIt's goin', it's goin', it's gone\n\nNow, go get your dictionary and your Pictionary\nCause much affliction with my diction friction slips and carries\nWords and herds like some cattle in the steeple\nPeople, there's no equal, or no sequel\nSo policies, of equalities get abolished\nDemolished, distortion of the static's gettin' polished\nUrges of splurgin' words will just be merged\nTogether, damn it's quite clever, however\nYou never, can sound alike, lyrics don't be poundin' like\nThese, troops, who be's, Roots\nInsult ya, mellow by culture, rhythmatic vulture\nApproach ya, with Magnetic shit that's Ultra\nI make MC's dangle like a bangle\nStrangle from every angle, my lingo jingles\nAnd it jangles under Kangols\nNahh them niggas don't want to tangle\nCause Roots get loose, negros get juiced like the mango\nTo be particular, extra-curricular, for pleasure\nMeasure, in any weather, value more than the treasure\nBaby, you're sayin' maybe, then comin' to flex\nNow you wonder what's next... {*laughter*}", "image": "https://images.genius.com/9f8cba3d7fe4e1fd4bc450c69d409af6.1000x1000x1.jpg", "artist": "The Roots", "raw": {"annotation_count": 26, "api_path":

that beast on the mic, like a dinosaur\nMaking y'all want more as we enter the encore\nKid, I'm every MC, it's all in me\nFor all eternity I represent in southern Philly\nIndeed as I distort, I proceed and make MC's bleed\nFake MC's need to take heed\nThe essence of my presence is a seed\nKid, I got styles you wouldn't believe\nApex my rap league\nThe Roots, poetic and you're pathetic\nI'm laughing at MC's, paragraphs, illiterates can't read\nOr can't seem to conceive, or construct a product\nThat don't suck, but record companies do not give a FUCK\nThat's why forever after you will hear the laughter\nAs I flip the rap chapter, you'll be on your back after\nIt's the master microphone magician\nDo work that make the people listen\nThoughts in mind glisten as your rhyme's missing\nHold tight, let's do this right\nCause I can see we got a lot of MC's that need insight tonight\nIt's like...\n\"Ayo I'm every MC, it's all in me\" *vocally scratched by Rahzel*\n\nNow if your vision's still blurry, I'ma underline the turns\nFlip the page, synonyms, your minimum, wage\nSo ??? to pass it, Black Thought, my support so niggas blast it\nIn sections, no questions get asked\nIt's, still no sequel, equality means equal\nBut, see, equality is we\nI enter your dimension with my tension\nCause I rhyme in such a non-tense, niggas will mind this\nIlladelphiatic\nMy culture might approach ya when I distort the static\nIf it's drama let's have it\nBroke, you're selling coke, then you know my staff will grab it\nThen drive off in traffic, with the paper mathematics\nBut back to the topic, The Roots dropping shit upon your optic\nQuite clever, like the right weather\nEvery (every) body (body) it's not like the Hills of Beverly\nThese creeps you niggas never see\nGet the picture? Here's a mixture of a medley\nPeace to the players on Smedely\nBaby, they say weak threats and you wonder what's next\n\"Ayo I'm every MC, it's all in me\" *vocally manipulated by Rahzel*\n\nOne time, for the mind when I exact\nThe lyrical styles of a contact like karate\nI'm driving down the streets in a Maserati pimping your hottie\nI'm living snotty, buying the clothes of John Gotti\nAn ill brother, want to test me kid? I'm an ill nigga\nWear only Tommy Illfiger, so go figure\nI'm a bad brother, word to mother\nYou can never touch me with lyrics that's sloppy\nI'm like a prophet and you can't stop me\nA prophecy, my proper synonyms synthesized by the\nD-I-C-E R-A-W, who the fuck are you?\nAny other way I roast your ass at a barbecue\nSplit, get off my dick or you will get split from your toes to\nYour wig, aww shit, here comes Dice Raw\nThe kid who never took a bad fall\nOn \"The Lesson,\" rapping is my profession\nYou can never censor me out with parental discretion\nLyrically I get toxic with rappers\nMy nuclear weapon a missile, keep it over my back\nIn a holster, pimping the wack MC's like hoes, too\nI'm broke like your mom's toaster\nYou can't fade me or degrade me, lyrically I get excellent, B\nYou want to reach my planet where I'm hard like granite?\nPacking motherfuckers up, and freaky like Janet\nYou could never touch me, son\nWhen I always represent and get the job done\nLogan Valley represent, peace to my niggas M.A.R.S\nI'm hitting you over your head making you see stars\nSo back up, don't make me act up, you'll get smacked up\nPhysically backed up and sold to grey bands in Southville\nWell I mean Northville\nI get ill, and I kill at will!\n\"Ayo I'm every MC, it's all in me\" *Rahzel does his thing*\n\"Dice riggedy Raw!\" *scratched by the one and only Rahzel*"}},

a press junket, I ain't seeking responses\nI stand where the people got the heat in they pockets\nYou mesmerized by the calm nonchalantness\nI spin a dark web on some John Hitchcock shit\nIf you ain't speaking your life, your rhyme's adopted\nIf it don't feel right, then stop it, you know what I'm sayin'?\n\n\nYo, children working, weapon producing\nNatural disaster got the planet in a panic\nWe all got to make that living\nSex, drugs, murder, politics and religion\nForms of hustling, watch who you put all your trust in\nWorldwide, we coincide with who suffering\nWho never had shit and ain't got nothing\nBut more struggling, it makes you wanna run up in the motherfuckin'\nHot zone for a piece of the cake back\nI can't work for it, I can certainly take that\nI'm fired up, thinking about the payback, ASAP\nYou fuck around, be a enemy of the state, black\nIll, but that's too real for TV\nIt's crazy when you too real to be free\nIf you don't got no paper, then steal this CD\nListen man, I'll let you know how it feel to be me", "image": "https://images.genius.com/e1df5a47164b92136a7e28ca98ef2314.1000x1000x1.jpg", "artist": "The Roots", "raw": {"annotation_count": 31, "api_path":

no more\nThings don't feel right over here\nLately I ain't been seeing it clear\nSeems to me nowadays things have changed\nI don't know if I feel the same\n\nYo, in the land of the unseen hand that holds trouble\nTheorize your game, it's difficult to roll a double\nThe struggle ain't right up in ya face, it's more subtle\nBut it's still coming across like the bridge and tunnel vision\nI try to school these bucks, but they don't wanna listen\nThat's the reason the system making this paper from the prison\nAnd that's the reason we living where they don't wanna visit\nWhere the dope slangin' keep swangin' like Sonny Liston\nThe money missing and there's mouths to feed\nGet the brain kicking, thinking of a thousand things\nRemember back in the days, when the kitchen had eggs\nAnd pancakes, chicken and greens and Kool Aid?\nWhen the refrigerator naked and the cupboard is bare\nPeople got to strip naked, stick 'em up in the air\nWas it lies when they told you wasn't nothing to fear?\nSomething don't feel right out here\n\n\nLook, my eyes open cause I'm really a watchman\nAnd when I'm writing my thoughts out, really I'm boxing\nMy main adversary any silly concoction\nFreeze your face like botulinum toxin\nIf you ain't trying to get popped, then give me a option\nHelicopters chopping from Philly to Compton\nThe Jones, the Richardsons, the Smiths and the Johnsons\nIf you ain't saying nothing, you the system's accomplice\nIt should play with your conscience, do away with the nonsense\nI'm overseeing anything within my circumference\nThis ain't a press junket, I ain't seeking responses\nI stand where the people got the heat in they pockets\nYou mesmerized by the calm nonchalantness\nI spin a dark web on some John Hitchcock shit\nIf you ain't speaking your life, your rhyme's adopted\nIf it don't feel right, then stop it, you know what I'm sayin'?\n\n\nYo, children working, weapon producing\nNatural disaster got the planet in a panic\nWe all got to make that living\nSex, drugs, murder, politics and religion\nForms of hustling, watch who you put all your trust in\nWorldwide, we coincide with who suffering\nWho never had shit and ain't got nothing\nBut more struggling, it makes you wanna run up in the motherfuckin'\nHot zone for a piece of the cake back\nI can't work for it, I can certainly take that\nI'm fired up, thinking about the payback, ASAP\nYou fuck around, be a enemy of the state, black\nIll, but that's too real for TV\nIt's crazy when you too real to be free\nIf you don't got no paper, then steal this CD\nListen man, I'll let you know how it feel to be me"}}, {"title": "Don't Feel Right - Album Version (Edited) (Full Length)", "album": null, "year": null, "lyrics": "It Don't Feel Right, it Don't Feel Right\nIt Don't Feel, it Don't

the art caffeine\nIt's over head like Omniverse screen\nI'm not the average savage that curse queens\nI'm something from his worst dreams\nFirst we handling first things, I'm subsurface unseen\nGrat'll hold planet by purse strings\nMC's are earthlings, not built to hurt things\nSpeaking the words of weaklings, nothing but sweet things\n\nMan each world, it ain't no time to recline\nAct up, get clapped up, my mind is the nine\nShine like jewels that spark, swimming with sharks\nNever caught speaking to NARC's, that's weak in the parks\nI'm the type to sit back and analyze the prize\nGrip it up and flee the scene wit a different disguise\nTake a detour, I be all that I can be whore\nTalking to this *bitch* life, had to make her my wife\nLive twice, got seven more lives to live\nI'm all out, taking things to the fullest extent\nHelp me get it down and we can split one-hundred percent\nRun a rapper through a maze like an experiment\nWord up, you know the legendary Roots crew, yo\n\n\nThe Raw Dice rise like a creature from out the swamp\nWith my blood-thirsty clergy that's on the hunt for conk\nWho pumps your heart, I made you wanna rhyme from the start\nYou should be more alert, then you wouldn't get hurt\nGet off your horse and on your P's and beware\nOf images you seeing, did deceiving, you're scared\nAnd even more shook up than the scenes that's near, I'm Dice Raw\nSting the inside of your mouth like a cold sore\nWho wanna piece, well it's Round One, let's begin\nI got a gun that's don't bust, it just suck niggas in\nI got shit that'll

I'm from the next e-on, supreme being that's unseen for emceeing\n\n\nYo, they all around me 'round me\nOn my head, they got a bounty\nI'm trying to get this bail up, so I can flee your

play bong\nYou wrong son, you thought I wasn't dropping a ton\nSit and think about the way I wanna tally a sum\n\nAiyyo I sneakfully snuck up from behind and got you\nFrom over there in them bushes, I chilled and watched you\nDancin all dolly as you pussy for them folly\nI knock you out wit one punch from me you been Ali-ed\nI float like hovercrafts and sting like vaccinations\nWhen my name said out loud, you'll lose your concentration\nDice Raw, D-I-C-E-R-A-W\nYou wanna take it, otherwise, fuck you gon' do?\nThat's what I thought, nada, nothing, caput, zero\nRough as sandpaper but still

discrept\nYou know the rep, we keep the flows in check\n\nMesmerizing, state of the art caffeine\nIt's over head like Omniverse screen\nI'm not the average savage that curse queens\nI'm something from his worst dreams\nFirst we handling first things, I'm subsurface unseen\nGrat'll hold planet by purse strings\nMC's are earthlings, not built to hurt things\nSpeaking the words of weaklings, nothing but sweet things\n\nMan each world, it ain't no time to recline\nAct up, get clapped up, my mind is the nine\nShine like jewels that spark, swimming with sharks\nNever caught speaking to NARC's, that's weak in the parks\nI'm the type to sit back and analyze the prize\nGrip it up and flee the scene wit a different disguise\nTake a detour, I be all that I can be whore\nTalking to this *bitch* life, had to make her my wife\nLive twice, got seven more lives to live\nI'm all out, taking things to the fullest extent\nHelp me get it down and we can split one-hundred percent\nRun a rapper through a maze like an experiment\nWord up, you know the legendary Roots crew, yo\n\n\nThe Raw Dice rise like a creature from out the swamp\nWith my blood-thirsty clergy that's on the hunt for

deceiving, you're scared\nAnd even more shook up than the scenes that's near, I'm Dice Raw\nSting the inside of your mouth like a cold sore\nWho wanna piece, well it's Round One, let's begin\nI got a gun that's don't bust, it just suck niggas in\nI got shit that'll have you begging me to shoot ya\nI'm the professor, you rock a dunce cap, go get a tutor\n\nYo, Okay Computer, Radiohead's knock to the\nFuture Shock like Curtis, at your service\nNone other than, the Fifth governing playin the cut again\nY'all clueless to what the fuck is up again\nYo, hard times and sufferin\nWhat, my peoples in the crevices strugglin\n'Nuff of them ?untie? soldier thespian\nBut I'm from the next e-on, supreme being that's unseen for emceeing\n\n\nYo, they all around me 'round me\nOn my head, they got a bounty\nI'm trying to get this bail up, so I can flee your county\nTriple-six, come in my mix, flood it with tricks\nI'm sharper than rough spoons for icepicks\nNiggas price bricks till dawn, if the money is long\nCats who play strong will inhale, then go play bong\nYou wrong son, you thought I wasn't dropping a ton\nSit and think about the way I wanna tally a sum\n\nAiyyo I sneakfully snuck up from behind and got you\nFrom over there in them bushes, I chilled and watched you\nDancin all dolly as you pussy for them folly\nI knock you out wit one punch from me you been Ali-ed\nI float like hovercrafts and sting like vaccinations\nWhen my name said out loud, you'll lose your concentration\nDice Raw, D-I-C-E-R-A-W\nYou wanna take it, otherwise, fuck you gon' do?\nThat's what I thought, nada, nothing, caput, zero\nRough as sandpaper but still smooth as a tiptoe\nRaw's taking over, baby don't tell me you ain't know\nA lot of kids can rap but you fucking with the pros\n\nKnow what I'm

instinct\nBut yo in-in-tro-tro-duc-ducing\n\nBehind thee, the mic champ-ion\nMore than a step beyond\nMothafuckers sweatin me, beggin me just to get me on\nMacro-cosmic, micro-master\n\nAiyyo I'm all the way way, Phil Phil-lay-lay\nPeople wanna see the way the Illadel play\nYo, look in the mirror, watch what yourself say\nI'm from S-P, no mortal man can test me\nThought, I keep a lin-e in, upper echelon-ean\nHeineken, hold the rhymin in, flows remindin em\nCats that hear me up, some shit from back in the past\nYour half-stepping ass could never fathom or grasp because\n\nYo we got a doctorate in cold-rockin it\nBringin this apocalype, nigga you mad topical\n*Bitch* my raps trick your optical\nMister superficial, I'm rippin apart your heart tissue\nThis is your official, dismissal\nI don't study the artificial, who fuckin wit the dark crystal\nYo where are is you? I'm movin like a smart missle\nAimed and guaranteed to hit you\n\nWord up, but when the Fifth do get on and perform, you in for it\nIt ain't no way to cen-sor it, my style metaphoric\nTo bricks and ten tons stacks hard to lift\nThe artist, comin out the Fifth darkness\n\nWe go back like ancients, while you ain't shit\nSubterranean, never against the gradiant\nAfro-American slash slash Half-Pleiadian\nIn your universe, my star's the most radiant\n\nEve-ry bo-dy,touch this Illa-Fifth Dynamite\nC'mon, touch this Illa-Fifth Dynamite\nC'mon, touch this Illa-Fifth Dynamite\nCheck it out,

wait outside\nTwo extremes collide like Jekyl and Hyde\nAnd I provide you wit the swerve you need, but take heed\nYou travellin' light speed\nIller than adventures you might read\nOfficial original breed, the justice league, yo it's the P-5-D\nStyle fashionist, other MC's they actresses\n\nYo it's the high-post, you bout to get shot down\nTryin to fly above this Illa-Fifth compound\nYou've known since the get-go, I rock your disco\nAin't nobody badder, but yo you get my gist so\nI represent so you gotta squint\nAs far as how I do it you ain't compen-sate\nWe causin nui-sance and get in-decent so save your two cents\nDon't come in my district, kickin that *bullshit*\n\nYo it's all simplistic, limited click get\nLyrically lifted, touchin the Fifth shit\nTrenches of the mentally twisted, you enlisted\n5 was the emblem on the mic you got hit wit\n\nAnd I stomp ya, till you call me conqueror\nBack-slappin all the niggas that slept\nThinkin that Elo could ever disappear\nI'm strippin' they veneer\nWit this non ether reefer, quiet frequent premiere\n\nEve-ry bo-dy,touch this Illa-Fifth Dynamite\nC'mon, touch this Illa-Fifth Dynamite\nC'mon, touch this Illa-Fifth Dynamite\nCheck it out,

in my area code\n\nBetter believe it, cause it is comin'\nYou won't believe the sight you see before your eyes\nYou won't believe the sight you see before your eyes\n\nYo, just push the panic button on your remote control\nThen enter the zone where I patrol this wicked realm called soul\nDiddly Bo leave her feelin' a saga foretold\nWho got, caught 'pon the block for gold, got the old heads froze\nThey peepin' outta closed windows\nThey not secure as they supposed, I watched it all unfold\nWitness another episode, with titanic panoramic view\nAs this manic-depressant, un-load with his gun hold\nWild like a son sold for cash\nGuns traded for sensi and hash, crack for ass\nEntire crews pass, not makin' the news flash\nBrews pass a memory and spark not to blast\nWhatever Ave. transform to the war path\nPure wrath from North down to 24th and Task\nGame slaughtered half, the niggas you acquainted with\nStreets tainted with camouflage, guerilla sabotage\nMy cousin's Jarette and Todd, was livin' type large\nGot caught then blast crashed off on Broad and Lombard\nSo many so-called hearts scarred, they buried in the yard\nLick shots at Babylon de one comfy bombard\nKids run far from traditional credit cards scams\nVeterans is nipped in the butt with large plans\nStick up kids is jumpin, outta plated Dodge Rams\nTo jam, you and your man it's mad drama and...\n\nBetter

across soon, who know who's the enemy?\nLots of shit has changed and it's kinda fucked up to see\nYou remember Tauseen, nigga thick slice of dream\nGo out fast for the buck, do anything for the cream\nNever seen a case like this, although it's quite contagious\nHe even got his little brother actin' all outrageous\nFrom dusk to dawn, and from dawn back to dusk\nThey do anything and everything, tryin' to come up\nIt's kinda sickenin', how the cash is so fuckin' addictive\nAnd when I say son wild they say that that's conflicted\nAin't nothin' but a contradiction in this world we live in\nCause the loot is for the takin', and not for the givin'\nThen the youngest one, will say \"I'ma die hustlin'\nFuck everybody except my brother who I'm trusted in\"\nI guess the young boy just did not know the truth\nCause the following week Tauseen' threw him off the roof\nAnd sometimes I wonder what the fuck I think about that\nHow nowadays kids get whacked for somethin' less than a pat\nBut I guess that's how it goes when there ain't no more rap\nThought he was his brother's keeper, but fuck all that\nNiggas causin' mayhem, from the P.M.'s to A.M.'s\nAmerica's worst nightmare -- guns in kids' hands\n\nBetter believe it, cause it is comin'\nYou won't believe the sight you see before your eyes\nYou won't believe the sight you see before your eyes\n\n.. in my area code\nIt's

the blocks explode, cock back and unload\nI seen it unfold in my area code, check it, yo\n\nIt was the year of '84 I was tryin' to get in the mix\nThe year when niggas rolled with sheepskins gazelles and kicks\nEven got the patent leather Adidas snatched off your feet\nMan that talk is cheap the crippled can't walk for weeks\nThe first sto was word to Penn and Teller's\nStrolled in the dollar house parties; in search for Cinderella\nWas just a little man real bold\nTryin' to act grown and old so the respect'll be shown\nA hip-hop a little pop and the break-dancin'\nWhen niggas wore windbreakers plot to take lambskins\nRemember Zigglers? Uptown the bottom's not quite the same\nSt. Charles in South Phil the ooh mob gang\nH-R-M Ogontz Ave. Brickyard to hollow\nNiggas was snatchin' gazzeles and flippin' pockets for the dallo\nYou wore your little rope chain in West Oak Lane\nAnd niggas from Logan came to extort we know the game\nYou proclaim this gangster bullshit talk\nAnd never even seen your man shot, or bodies in chalk\nAggravated assault, another weekend in the precinct\nTakin' everybody for their ring, man, that's how we think\nBack then you catch a sucker-punch off guard\nNiggas will pull your card, tryin' to walk around all hard\nNiggas quick to flip your pockets if you lip service\nWhen you see fifteen niggas deep, with scully's, get nervous\nIt ain't no tellin' what they could do to you\nSo you clutch up, thinkin' and knowin' you gettin' stuck up\nIn another episode in my area code, episode in my area code\n\nBetter believe it, cause it is comin'\nYou won't believe the sight you see before your eyes\nYou won't believe the sight you see before your eyes\n\nThis another episode in my area code\nEpisodes in my area code, yo\nWell this another episode\nYeah, they in my area code\nExplode.. unload..\nUnfold in my area code\nYeah, this in my area code\nEpisodes in my area code\nExplode.. unload..\nUnfold in my area code\nYeah\n\nBetter believe it, cause it is comin'\nYou won't believe the

episodes in my area code\nWhere the blocks explode, where the temperature is cold\nIt's just an episode in my area code\nAnother episode in my area code\nAll sorts of episodes in my area code\nWhere the blocks explode, ride strapped and unload\nI seen it unfold in my area code\n\nBetter believe it, cause it is comin'\nYou won't believe the sight you see before your eyes\nYou won't believe the sight you see before your eyes\n\nYo, just push the panic button on your remote control\nThen enter the zone where I patrol this wicked realm called soul\nDiddly Bo leave her feelin' a saga foretold\nWho got, caught 'pon the block for gold, got the old heads froze\nThey peepin' outta closed windows\nThey not secure as they supposed, I watched it all unfold\nWitness another episode, with titanic panoramic view\nAs this manic-depressant, un-load with his gun hold\nWild like a son sold for cash\nGuns traded for sensi and hash, crack for ass\nEntire crews pass, not makin' the news flash\nBrews pass a memory and spark not to blast\nWhatever Ave. transform to the war path\nPure wrath from North down to 24th and Task\nGame slaughtered half, the niggas you acquainted with\nStreets tainted with camouflage, guerilla sabotage\nMy cousin's Jarette and Todd, was livin' type large\nGot caught then blast crashed off on Broad and Lombard\nSo many so-called hearts scarred, they buried in the yard\nLick shots at Babylon de one comfy bombard\nKids run far from traditional credit cards scams\nVeterans is nipped in the butt with large plans\nStick up kids is jumpin, outta plated Dodge Rams\nTo jam, you and your man it's mad drama and...\n\nBetter believe it, cause it is comin'\nYou won't believe the sight you see before your eyes\nYou won't believe the sight you see before your eyes\n\nYo, the episodes to my area code\nJust another episodes in my area code\nWhere the blocks explode, where the temperature is cold\nIt's just an episode in my area code\nAll sorts of episodes in my area code\nJust another episode in my area code\nWhere the blocks explode, cock back and unload\nI seen it unfold in my area code, check it\n\nThis is for all of my niggas, that are R.I.P.'s\nYou ain't missin' nothin', life ain't what it should be\nI'll pass across soon, who know who's the enemy?\nLots of shit has changed and it's kinda fucked up to see\nYou remember Tauseen, nigga thick slice of dream\nGo out fast for the buck, do anything for the cream\nNever seen a case like this, although it's quite contagious\nHe even got his little brother actin' all outrageous\nFrom dusk to dawn, and from dawn back to dusk\nThey do anything and everything, tryin' to come up\nIt's kinda sickenin', how the cash is so fuckin' addictive\nAnd when I say son wild they say that that's conflicted\nAin't nothin' but a contradiction in this world we live in\nCause the loot is for the takin', and not for the givin'\nThen the youngest one, will say \"I'ma die hustlin'\nFuck everybody except my brother who I'm trusted in\"\nI guess the young boy just did not know the truth\nCause the following week Tauseen' threw him off the roof\nAnd sometimes I wonder what the fuck I think about that\nHow nowadays kids get whacked for somethin' less than a pat\nBut I guess that's how it goes when there ain't no more rap\nThought he was his brother's keeper, but fuck all that\nNiggas causin' mayhem, from the P.M.'s to A.M.'s\nAmerica's worst nightmare -- guns in kids' hands\n\nBetter believe it, cause it is comin'\nYou won't believe the sight you see before your eyes\nYou won't believe the sight you see before your eyes\n\n.. in my area code\nIt's another episode in my area code\nWhere the blocks explode, cock back and unload\nI seen it unfold in my area code\nJust another episode in my area code\nAll sorts of episodes in my area code\nWhere the blocks explode, cock back and unload\nI seen it unfold in my area code, check it, yo\n\nIt was the year of '84 I was tryin' to get in the mix\nThe year when niggas rolled with sheepskins gazelles and kicks\nEven got the patent leather Adidas snatched off your feet\nMan that talk is cheap the crippled can't walk for weeks\nThe first sto was word to Penn and Teller's\nStrolled in the dollar house parties; in search for Cinderella\nWas just a little man real bold\nTryin' to act grown and old so the respect'll be shown\nA hip-hop a little pop and the break-dancin'\nWhen niggas wore windbreakers plot to take lambskins\nRemember Zigglers? Uptown the bottom's not quite the same\nSt. Charles in South Phil the ooh mob gang\nH-R-M Ogontz Ave. Brickyard to hollow\nNiggas was snatchin' gazzeles and flippin' pockets for the dallo\nYou wore your little rope chain in West Oak Lane\nAnd niggas from Logan came to extort we know the game\nYou proclaim this gangster bullshit talk\nAnd never even seen your man shot, or bodies in chalk\nAggravated assault, another weekend in the precinct\nTakin' everybody for their ring, man, that's how we think\nBack then you catch a sucker-punch off guard\nNiggas will pull your card, tryin' to walk around all hard\nNiggas quick to flip your pockets if you lip service\nWhen you see fifteen niggas deep, with scully's, get nervous\nIt ain't no tellin' what they could do to you\nSo you clutch up, thinkin' and knowin' you gettin' stuck up\nIn another episode in my area code, episode in my area code\n\nBetter believe it, cause it is comin'\nYou won't believe the sight you see before your eyes\nYou won't believe the sight you see before your eyes\n\nThis another episode in my area code\nEpisodes in my area code, yo\nWell this another episode\nYeah, they in my area code\nExplode.. unload..\nUnfold in my area code\nYeah, this in my area code\nEpisodes in my area code\nExplode.. unload..\nUnfold in my area code\nYeah\n\nBetter believe it, cause it is comin'\nYou won't believe the sight you see before your eyes\nYou won't believe the sight you see before your eyes\nBetter believe it, cause it is comin'"}}, {"title": "Essawhamah?

it's realer than a heart attack\nIt wasn't really that ill until the start of crack\nNow it's a body caught every night on the Almanac\nRock bottom where them cops gotta problem at\nWhere them outsiders getting popped for they wallet at\nI had nothin but I made somethin outta that\nNow I'm the first out the limo like Charlie Mack\nFrom 215 it's him the livest one\nAnd he's representin Philly to the fullest\nBlacks the realest\nYou can't touch him and not for nothin\nIf you bout hip hop then you gots to love it\nIf not then fuck it\nI'm still handlin\nSmokin more reefer than Redman and them damaging MC's\nAnd my name's 'Riq Geez you endangered species\nFor what I do I'm about to up the fees\nI'm paperchase motivated I ain't the one to play with\nThese cats get set ablaze\nYou can't have it y'all way but I'd rather parlay\nJust smoke og and get cabbage all day\nThe way foreplay causes your main vein to sing\nYour style so splendid you bout your business\nYou arousing my interests\nYou sharper than a Shogun\nYou know the way it go, huh, game know what I'm talkin bout\n\nHus, that's short for hustlers\nWe Black Ink/Raw Life productions\nTryin to find our spota amongst the ruckus\nAnd be sucker free, flea chumps and busters\nMan yeah, Get 'em hus, get 'em hus, get 'em hus\n\nHey yo I'm tryin to get it at any cost so it's no remorse\nWhen I'm blastin off like you been askin for it\nWhen Black step in the door all hats is off\nYour hands up in the air goin back and forth\nI'm about ready for a classic massacre\nI'll make it hotter than when Shaft in Africa\nJump outta a black Porshe huffin a fat cigar\nNight ridin on 'em like my last name Hasselhoff\nVoted unlikely to succeed cause my class was full\nOf naysayers, cheaters and thieves\nAll it gave me was a good enough reason to leave\nAnd put the writing on the wall for y'all to read it and weep\nCause I'm the force of the Lord, the rage of hell\nYou'd rather head for the hills and save yourselves\nMy Man rip drums like He ringin the bells\nThe King of the Realm you seen Him do His thing in a film\nCome on\n\n\nDreams when M16's with infrared beams\nBlowin up presidents' cribs with cans of kerosene\nHighjack the limousine with a strategic routine\nThen blast my enemy, head for the Caribbean\nMilitant guerilla camp is ready for war\nLay your corner face down, place down your jewels cash and four four\nWhen I score prepare for toture\nFuck around and make your town Warsaw\nI'm from Illadel the land where the killas dwell\nMy technique is to ambush you guerilla style\nMy instinct is of a killer whale bang you up from head to toe\nWith lyrics I pack like a nine millimal\nMy types subliminal mentality switched to criminal\nImporting heroin internash from Senegal\nA soldier takes a stripes from a general\nUsed the mike of iron or lead\nYou choose your mineral", "image": "https://images.genius.com/e1df5a47164b92136a7e28ca98ef2314.1000x1000x1.jpg", "artist": "The

have to fake it\nI could not make it\nYou could not take it\n\nYeah, where I'mma start it at, look I'mma part of that\nDowntown Philly where it's realer than a heart attack\nIt wasn't really that ill until the start of crack\nNow it's a body caught every night on the Almanac\nRock bottom where them cops gotta problem at\nWhere them outsiders getting popped for they wallet at\nI had nothin but I made somethin outta that\nNow I'm the first out the limo like Charlie Mack\nFrom 215 it's him the livest one\nAnd he's representin Philly to the fullest\nBlacks the realest\nYou can't touch him and not for nothin\nIf you bout hip hop then you gots to love it\nIf not then fuck it\nI'm still handlin\nSmokin more reefer than Redman and them damaging MC's\nAnd my name's 'Riq Geez you endangered species\nFor what I do I'm about to up the fees\nI'm paperchase motivated I ain't the one to play with\nThese cats get set ablaze\nYou can't have it y'all way but I'd rather parlay\nJust smoke og and get cabbage all day\nThe way foreplay causes your main vein to sing\nYour style so splendid you bout your business\nYou arousing my interests\nYou sharper than a Shogun\nYou know the way it go, huh, game know what I'm talkin bout\n\nHus, that's short for hustlers\nWe Black Ink/Raw Life productions\nTryin to find our spota amongst the ruckus\nAnd be sucker free, flea chumps and busters\nMan yeah, Get 'em hus, get 'em hus, get 'em hus\n\nHey yo I'm tryin to get it at any cost so it's no remorse\nWhen I'm blastin off like you been askin for it\nWhen Black step in the door all hats is off\nYour hands up in the air goin back and forth\nI'm about ready for a classic massacre\nI'll make it hotter than when Shaft in Africa\nJump outta a black Porshe huffin a fat cigar\nNight ridin on 'em like my last name Hasselhoff\nVoted unlikely to succeed cause my class was full\nOf naysayers, cheaters and thieves\nAll it gave me was a good enough reason to leave\nAnd put the writing on the wall for y'all to read it and weep\nCause I'm the force of the Lord, the rage of hell\nYou'd rather head for the hills and save yourselves\nMy Man rip drums like He ringin the bells\nThe King of the Realm you seen Him do His thing in a film\nCome on\n\n\nDreams when M16's with infrared beams\nBlowin up presidents' cribs with cans of kerosene\nHighjack the limousine with a strategic routine\nThen blast my enemy, head for the Caribbean\nMilitant guerilla camp is ready for war\nLay your corner face down, place down your jewels cash and four four\nWhen I score prepare for toture\nFuck around and make your town Warsaw\nI'm from Illadel the land where the killas dwell\nMy technique is to ambush you guerilla style\nMy instinct is of a killer whale bang you up from head to toe\nWith lyrics I pack like a nine millimal\nMy types subliminal mentality switched to criminal\nImporting heroin internash from Senegal\nA soldier takes a stripes from a general\nUsed the mike of iron or lead\nYou choose your

sicko show like Mike Moore\nMy city ain't nothin' like yours\nSlippin' into darkness like war\nNight crawl with the lights off\nYou see a lot of life lost for the white horse\nRegardless, the charges making us all targets\nAll on the red carpet, guns from the black market\nWho got the politician's in they back pocket\nPimp slap, pump that, give me that profit\nWhen you make contact, give me that gossip\nIf you break contract, you'll be that hostage\nThey getting busy and the city is raw\nBetter deadbolt the door, it ain't safe no more\n\nSouthside\n(Get busy)\nNorthside\n(Get busy)\nWestside\n(Get busy)\nWorldwide\n(Get busy) \n\nApproach with caution, be cautious when talking to bosses\nI feel I've been through a metamorphosis\nI'm mutated by unknown forces\nThe feeling of course is\nSomethin' that's hard to describe\nI'm half-dead, never felt more alive\nReborn, remove the gold coins from my eyes\nI've been down, but now I'm back up\nI'm about to act up, boy, you better back up\nWhen you see me set up shop, know to pack up\nCause I crack up when a rapper get slapped up\nNumber one reason y'all should give rap up\nDice, it's mines, I got it all wrapped up\nI'm kind of like W.E.B. Du Bois\nMeets Heavy D and the Boyz\nSmooth as a Rolls Royce\nBuilt like a tank, smokin' on dank\nWalkin' through the Guggenheim\nRaw Life, Black Inc\n\n\nNow on your mark, get set\nGo cop everything you ever heard by P. Crack\nDice Raw and Black\nFuck the Internet\nBuy a baseball bat, break a bootlegger leg\nAll I listen to is vets, you're fresh off the step\nI'll come directly at your OG neck\nI'm used to the 1-2 check, not the 1-2 step\nI'm strapped, I'll leave every cat among you wet\nNow let's go, you know I'm politically incorrect\nAt the show, I start it with a\n\"Can I get a ho?\"\nAnd the ho's go retarded\nThe po-po tape off the stage for caution\nIt's bad lands, North Philly get it in\nIt's Crack man - used to back spin\nNow I spend stacks and stacks\nAnd Uncle Sam tryin' to tax all my hard-earned raps\nDamn, we making yens, pesos, euros - we representin'"}}, {"title": "Glitches (The Skin You're In)", "album": "Down to Earth Soundtrack ", "year": null, "lyrics": "You live, you die\nAnd spend the years in between asking the question\nWhy you've been through what you been\nYou lose, you win, you even pay for other sins\nBut you must always adore the skin you are in\n\nI woke up and it was pouring down rain\nI put my head on, it really wasn't no thing\nOne of them days I was feeling immune to the pain\nThrew on, Alice Coltrane, smoked and sang\nAnd wrote this flame composed to the rhythm of the droplets\nAnd went whispering similar to gossip\nThe kick slapping at the window glass\nSlow down the globe so it don't spin too fast\nBecause, I've been running like a river since\nThe age of my early innocence\nIt just made me ambitious\nMy grams used to tell me \"Man listen\nIf you can't burn, don't step into the kitchen\"\nYou muscle your turn, the laws of the land vicious\nWe gotta stick to the plan, which is\nPursuing true riches, whether we trade stock or wash dishes\nThroughout setbacks and few glitches\nThe Big Picture's the focus, fuck being hopeless\nOr helpless, we not selfish so we wrote this\nGive it to ya, make you feel good\nKnow what I'm talkin about?

(Say what?) Bust it, let a\nBrother tell another about the real grits getters\n(Yeah, the grits getters get the grits y'all)\n* repeat 4X w/ minor variations *\n\nYeah I likes to unzip it, strip it then grip it\nTo be specific I won't lick it, so get the ticket\nFlip it like it was a coin, put the loins in the groins\nIn other words the groins I stretch, now you gets the sketch\nYou, know I use my mark like the worm on Noah's Ark\nBut if I happen to see a spark, I umm, parks my bark\nGuess I haves to rest my lumber for the next number to sum\nBut so I can't slumber or sleep, my shovel's diggin deep\nPeep this hick whose name was Vickie\nGettin tricky rather slicky\nHer performance showed endurance\nShe said, \"Me like to licky licky\"\nBody more gracious, or should I say bodacious\nTook my order then she sorta served me\nLike she was a waitress\nNever will I say that she was tasteless\nMaker of the pastry, so's I calls her pastress\nStill enthused, cause I got my cruise on\nP-O-L-O blues on, when I choose to move I puts my shoes on\nProtection, against infection\nErect projections travels South in your mouth\nLike a dentist checked in, commence to be intent\nShe said, \"I can't understand you, but damn you like Prince\"\nI make it feel like a Zulu, from Honolulu\nBy the way she roll away like a dog who name was Ubu\nThey also said the way I entered from the center\nIs adventurous, imprint on you dentures when I bust\nOr I thrust, Mid-Atlantic, they act like a schitzophrenic\nSometimes they panic like I'm Diggin on a Planet\nI don't gotta Beama or a Jetta, ?C-ka-Reama alla netta?\nMalik is the sleek grits, getter\nWho gets the grits? (Say what?) Bust it, let a\nBrother tell another about the real grits getters\n(Yeah, the grits getters get the grits y'all)\n* repeat 4X w/ minor variations *\n\nI would be lyin if I told you I could not\nPrepare a fat bowl of sticky, grits for a quickie\nHumans get picky, and judge it by the thickness\nBut if it bends your spoon then add some butter with the quickness\nI might get a bit smoother, if you move it to a\nBetter, position, that's probably what she wishin\nYou can add some groovy spices, to give it extra\nBut my advice is to first let it simmer\nHot, if it's hot then let the pot sit and cool\nCause if you spill your milk, we label you beginner\nHumans gotta know, that I keep my bowl, full of grits\nSwingin with their daughters while their parents throwin fits\nTellin me to change my diet plan, to bran cereal\nOr rice, I tried that twice, it didn't work\nIn fact, it made my milk kinda sour\nHalf and half, part creamer, and skeemer\nThat's why if it's grits then it gotta be organic\nCause if it's artificial, I panic\nWho gets the grits? (Say what?) Bust it, let a\nBrother tell another about the real grits getters\n(Yeah, the grits getters get the grits y'all)\n* repeat 4X w/ minor variations *\nYo man, what about me man?\n* everybody clowns *\nYo man, just pass your grits down man\n(You needs to eat Gerber man)\n\nWho gets the grits, now let me tell ya\nA plenty posse bloom from the cellar, to nail ya\nDaughter or your sister, the younger skins elixir\nKick a cat, but I won't lick a cat, I'll figure\nI'd rather, play the thigh kisser, sister\nI don't die swift, and yo I'm not a quitter\nSo umm, let me place my hands upon that waist and trace\nMy way to the right nip and left nip then sip\nSimilac, until my Jimmy grows fat, grab my pack of hats\nFrom the back, then flee, to the next block\nTo knock off socks, yo you know my props\nSo father, don't bother\nCause once the grits is hot, yo they're good as got\nWho gets the grits? (Say what?) Bust it, let a\nBrother tell another about the real grits getters\n(Yeah, the grits getters get the grits y'all)\n* repeat 4X w/ minor variations *\n* talking to fade *"}}, {"title": "Guns Are Drawn",

we fuel\nLiving a lie eventually believing it's true\nA lot of people here are frauds one could be you\nIt's outrageous and they just ain't nothing\nBut save us an ocean of brown fists in various flavors\nA favor for a favor man, this is the majors\nTell me what you would do with no phone or pagers\nNo Kinko's, no Fed Ex and no ATM's\nWhat you gone do when the police state begin\nWell it already began but I guess it depends on\nWhat's really going on, what's happening, huh\nMilitary target practicing\nThey finna write another Patriot Act again\nThe days is short the nights is long\nThe fight goes on\nThe pistol and the pipes are drawn\n\nThe middle of the night\nWe fight like barbarians\nIn sight of the former might\nYou might think that it's a waste\nOf our time\nAnd I think you would be right\nTill he drop that rhyme\n\nAnd some might say that it's a waste of time\nCause ain't no amount of dancing finna break the bondage\nWe go to war and transcend space and time\nWhen every record ain't a record just to shake behinds\nYou know the stakes is high we in the face of drama\nThat's why we can't shake it or escape the problem\nIts like a game of roulette the barrel revolving\nThey only wanna see us occupying a coffin\nMothers crying too often from they lost child leaving\nFrom trying to get over, get under, get even\nGet inside getting, getting dumped, getting greedy\nWe got to get it right\nIt ain't about to be easy\nYou better pull you goggles up, it's about to get greasy\nBelieve it's on as long as we can still speak freely\nPages of my life would make it hard to read me\nI know my people hearing me, holler if y'all need me\n\nThe middle of the night\nWe fight like barbarians\nIn sight of the former might\nYou might think that it's a waste\nOf our time\nAnd I think you would be right\nTill he drop that rhyme", "image": "https://images.genius.com/e5d2c4051e327459d999ad70681ad138.500x500x1.jpg", "artist": "The Roots", "raw":

be cool it could be too\nStop running round in circles off of what we fuel\nLiving a lie eventually believing it's true\nA lot of people here are frauds one could be you\nIt's outrageous and they just ain't nothing\nBut save us an ocean of brown fists in various flavors\nA favor for a favor man, this is the majors\nTell me what you would do with no phone or pagers\nNo Kinko's, no Fed Ex and no ATM's\nWhat you gone do when the police state begin\nWell it already began but I guess it depends on\nWhat's really going on, what's happening, huh\nMilitary target practicing\nThey finna write another Patriot Act again\nThe days is short the nights is long\nThe fight goes on\nThe pistol and the pipes are drawn\n\nThe middle of the night\nWe fight like barbarians\nIn sight of the former might\nYou might think that it's a waste\nOf our time\nAnd I think you would be right\nTill he drop that rhyme\n\nAnd some might say that it's a waste of time\nCause ain't no amount of dancing finna break the bondage\nWe go to war and transcend space and time\nWhen every record ain't a record just to shake behinds\nYou know the stakes is high we in the face of drama\nThat's why we can't shake it or escape the problem\nIts like a game of roulette the barrel revolving\nThey only wanna see us occupying a coffin\nMothers crying too often from they lost child leaving\nFrom trying to get over, get under, get even\nGet inside getting, getting dumped, getting greedy\nWe got to get it right\nIt ain't about to be easy\nYou better pull you goggles up, it's about to get greasy\nBelieve it's on as long as we can still speak freely\nPages of my life would make it hard to read me\nI know my people hearing me, holler if y'all need me\n\nThe middle of the night\nWe fight like barbarians\nIn sight of the former might\nYou might think that it's a waste\nOf our time\nAnd I think you would be right\nTill he drop that rhyme"}}, {"title": "Hardware", "album": null, "year": null, "lyrics": "(Do it

hustla like her grandpoppa\nHer destiny done been determined so you can't stop her\nFrom being independent, earning paper and proper\nMore like a lawyer or a doctor, not a man-watcher\nThat's where your man got ya, it's a big world out yeah\nI'm trying to make a black diamond or a pearl out yeah\nAnd hit the people to the way the world twirl out yeah\nAnd when I thank heaven for my little

maybe you can blue-line\nOoh, I'm caught up in the moment for the meantime\nG, I'm all about the green like tree pines\nSee I'm tryin' to get the scratch like a feline\nHopin' that my seed don't know the struggle like me, I'm\nHustlin' to make a buck, make a buck and fuck it up\nFuck it up and suck it up, then go and make another buck\nGet the money, get the money, that's what I know\nI'm hopin'

what I made for the wife and kids\nThey say life's a bitch, but it's one life to live\nI want my baby where that cake and the icing is\nOut of them crisis-es, off of them vices-es\nThey see what we do and grow up in all likenesses\nReally I don't wanna see em having to fight for this\nStory of the family biz, I'mma rewrite the script\nDaughter of a hip-hopper, hustla like her grandpoppa\nHer destiny done been determined so you can't stop her\nFrom being independent, earning paper and proper\nMore like a lawyer or a doctor, not a man-watcher\nThat's where your man got ya, it's a big world out yeah\nI'm trying to make a black diamond or a pearl out yeah\nAnd hit the people to the way the world twirl out yeah\nAnd when I thank heaven for my little girl\n\nPlease let her be a hustla, baby be a hustla\nHope my baby girl grows up to be a hustla\nBetter be a hustla, baby be a hustla\nIf not, then you're only a customer\nPlease let him be a hustla, baby be a hustla\nHope my baby boy grows up to be a hustla\nBetter be a hustla, baby be a hustla\nIf not, then you're only a customer\n\nSugar Slim, I'm slicker than a squid, nigga no kids\nNo baby mama, Sugar free from the drama\nSugar be where he wanna, no sweat like a sauna\nNo judge, your honor can't tell me to raise mine\nFigured that in due time, if and when I do find\nTrue love, Buddha, maybe you can blue-line\nOoh, I'm caught up in the moment for the meantime\nG, I'm all about the green like tree pines\nSee I'm tryin' to get the scratch like a feline\nHopin' that my seed don't know the struggle like me, I'm\nHustlin' to make a buck, make a buck and fuck it up\nFuck it up and suck it up, then go and make another buck\nGet the money, get the money, that's what I know\nI'm hopin' that my seeds know a little more than I

make rhymes in five minutes\nMind of a dentist, crimes of a menace\nPress rewind, see what you find in my image\nTake you niggas back to the line of the scrimmage\n'Riq, you know we pull a freak with

can't help hiding my secrets that's so known\nI only do what I got to cause it's possible\nAnd climbin' over whatever's known as an obstacle\n\n\nUgh, I Can't Help It, maybe I'm selfish\nMaybe the way I'm runnin' is becomin' a health risk\nAll I can see is smoke through tortoise shell\nGazelle 650's, I'm feelin' like I'm makin' a sales pitch\nMy head already so heavy, it's makin' the scales tip\nI

said I'm ready for war, but I'm protected\nI don't even know when it's comin', but I expect it\nLost all semblance of hope, so now I'm left with\nNervous conditions, addictions, in addition\nTo vixens that mixed in with the wrong crowd\nMy life is on a flight that's goin' down\nMy mother had an abortion for the wrong child\nWith the time I felt love, that's gone now\nBeen replaced by purple rains and some storm clouds\nMisery love misery\nSo why make friends? Let's make some enemies\nAnd now I got a habit that wasn't meant for me\nNow I'm in a marriage that wasn't meant to be\nOne more reason to change identity\nThe cars, the crime, K's, penalties", "image": "https://images.genius.com/e415802f1331a049bcbf0af9916e51d9.500x500x1.jpg", "artist": "The Roots", "raw": {"annotation_count": 11, "api_path": "/songs/49136", "description": {"dom": {"tag": "root", "children": [{"tag": "p", "children": ["Rising Down is the eighth studio album by American hip-hop band The Roots, released April 28, 2008 on Def Jam Recordings.

It\nI Can't Help It, I Can't Help It\n\nLive with it, that's how I survive with it\nTalk jive with it, you take a dive with it\nConnive with it, depart and arrive with it\nHarsh thrive, that's why it's part I with it\nI did it, make rhymes in five minutes\nMind of a dentist, crimes of a menace\nPress rewind, see what you find in my image\nTake you niggas back to the line of the scrimmage\n'Riq, you know we pull a freak with the flow\nTalk's cheap, that's why we speak with the dough\nIll technique show I'm sleek with the flow\nIt's cold outside, nigga, sleep with the snow\nI tweek in the low tone, freak with the ozone\nI can't help hiding my secrets that's so known\nI only do what I got to cause it's possible\nAnd climbin' over whatever's known as an obstacle\n\n\nUgh, I Can't Help It, maybe I'm selfish\nMaybe the way I'm runnin' is becomin' a health risk\nAll I can see is smoke through tortoise shell\nGazelle 650's, I'm feelin' like I'm makin' a sales pitch\nMy head already so heavy, it's makin' the scales tip\nI got my own pressure and got everyone else's\nI'm rehabilitated, still feelin' rebellious\nCandidate of heart failure, more pills then Elvis\nIn a layer cake, half-chocolate, half-velvet\nI'm listenin' to some Howe Melvin\nI got too many options, there's so many toxins\nYo, ain't no really tellin' what we killin' ourselves with\nI lit a cigarette and inhaled it\nI'm thinkin' of some rhymes more iller then a threatening ailment\nI'm on some bomb threat in the mail shit\nBecause of all the things I dealt with, nigga, I Can't Help It\n\n\nI never said I'm ready to die, but I accept it\nNever said I'm ready for war, but I'm protected\nI don't even know when it's comin', but I expect it\nLost all semblance of hope, so now I'm left with\nNervous conditions, addictions, in addition\nTo vixens that mixed in with the wrong crowd\nMy life is on a flight that's goin' down\nMy mother had an abortion for the wrong child\nWith the time I felt love, that's gone now\nBeen replaced by purple rains and some storm clouds\nMisery love misery\nSo why make friends? Let's make some enemies\nAnd now I got a habit that wasn't meant for me\nNow I'm in a marriage that wasn't meant to be\nOne more reason to change identity\nThe cars, the crime, K's, penalties"}},

away\nOne false move and I'll blow you away\n\nYo I don't really know but somebody said\nThat the O.G. flow, it could fuck witcha head\nAnd the po-lice know that the green black and red\nToo strong to con-trol, they study what I said\nDig it my name is 'Riq, and when I'm on the mic\nI'm known to spit somethin that these MC's hate\nI couldn't care less what you feel what you say\nCause I gotta put it to you in my own special way\nI'm a MONSTER!\nYou know I'm certified sick\nI came from the corner where nobody got shit\nTook the cards I was dealt, turned it into hot spit\nNow I'm not only a passenger, I'm in the cockpit\nBeen a long time comin, I was caught in the scramble\nOf cats, tryin to do the same thing that they man do\nEagles born to fly, rivers made to ramble\n\"A Dangerous Mind\", I'm a prime example\n\n\nSuper-fans wanna run up on me sparkin the ground up\nYou need to fall back, could be NARC's around us\nYou in a hot area for marchin powder\nIf you holdin chowder, just walk without it\nThem real crook brothers don't talk about it\nThey never make a move 'til they thought shit out kid\nI knew a lot of men who did bids for mayhem\nThey made a lot of money, they money never made them\nThe game of survival is filled with rivals\nKnives and fo'-five slugs flyin in spirals\nThe wicked is diseased and it ain't all viral\nCould be greed and gluttony bubblin inside you\nDawg, follow your pride, the rhythm'll guide you\nYo, follow them guys, them niggas'll rob you\nAnd have you up in somethin that don't really involve you\nBut you don't give a fuck you wanna pump the volume, I know\n\n\nYo, aiyyo the waistline thumping, the face kinda jumping the game\nLooking sweeter than a bassline bumping\nDon't come 'round me sparks and waste time fronting\nThem trick ass marks'll get the eight-five dumping\nIt ain't really bout nothing\nPhilly just love cuttin\nThey shut shit down before the law start shuttin\nGet your route right cousin\nBe out nightclubbin relaxed\nAnd wanna get lights out tonight brother, perhaps\nIt's the percussion that keeps shit, kinetic\nFor some it ain't as fame, more sweet the street credit\nSome cats that play dirty didn't live, to regret it\nBut move to the music he can live through the record\nI'm a Philly boss player, a dope rhyme sayer\nIt's Black Ink back getting cake by the layer\nBy the stack, coming at us, get your weight right yeah\nIf not, you making a mistake right there, for real", "image": "https://images.genius.com/e5d2c4051e327459d999ad70681ad138.500x500x1.jpg", "artist": "The Roots", "raw":

banging away\nMake one move and I'll blow you away\nOne false move and I'll blow you away\n\nYo I don't really know but somebody said\nThat the O.G. flow, it could fuck witcha head\nAnd the po-lice know that the green black and red\nToo strong to con-trol, they study what I said\nDig it my name is 'Riq, and when I'm on the mic\nI'm known to spit somethin that these MC's hate\nI couldn't care less what you feel what you say\nCause I gotta put it to you in my own special way\nI'm a MONSTER!\nYou know I'm certified sick\nI came from the corner where nobody got shit\nTook the cards I was dealt, turned it into hot spit\nNow I'm not only a passenger, I'm in the cockpit\nBeen a long time comin, I was caught in the scramble\nOf cats, tryin to do the same thing that they man do\nEagles born to fly, rivers made to ramble\n\"A Dangerous Mind\", I'm a prime example\n\n\nSuper-fans wanna run up on me sparkin the ground up\nYou need to fall back, could be NARC's around us\nYou in a hot area for marchin powder\nIf you holdin chowder, just walk without it\nThem real crook brothers don't talk about it\nThey never make a move 'til they thought shit out kid\nI knew a lot of men who did bids for mayhem\nThey made a lot of money, they money never made them\nThe game of survival is filled with rivals\nKnives and fo'-five slugs flyin in spirals\nThe wicked is diseased and it ain't all viral\nCould be greed and gluttony bubblin inside you\nDawg, follow your pride, the rhythm'll guide you\nYo, follow them guys, them niggas'll rob you\nAnd have you up in somethin that don't really involve you\nBut you don't give a fuck you wanna pump the volume, I know\n\n\nYo, aiyyo the waistline thumping, the face kinda jumping the game\nLooking sweeter than a bassline bumping\nDon't come 'round me sparks and waste time fronting\nThem trick ass marks'll get the eight-five dumping\nIt ain't really bout nothing\nPhilly just love cuttin\nThey shut shit down before the law start shuttin\nGet your route right cousin\nBe out nightclubbin relaxed\nAnd wanna get lights out tonight brother, perhaps\nIt's the percussion that keeps shit, kinetic\nFor some it ain't as fame, more sweet the street credit\nSome cats that play dirty didn't live, to regret it\nBut move to the music he can live through the record\nI'm a Philly boss player, a dope rhyme sayer\nIt's Black Ink back getting cake by the layer\nBy the stack, coming at us, get your weight right yeah\nIf not, you making a mistake right there, for real"}}, {"title": "I'm Just A Slave", "album": "Golden Globes",

two-way pager\nTill ya main thing getting me the captain saver\nI won't backslide cause I'd be a failure to mics\nRip tight like it's my genitalia\nHuh?\nThe hip biatch she\nAin't your D

don't visit there\nIt's somewhere between Jersey and Delaware\nPhilly never scared and them niggas ain't timid there\nThem young triggers lose lives by the minute there\nIt might start but the fight never finish there\nThey all fucked up tryna get the gingerbread\nA few stacks be the price for a nigga's head\nCops and robbers, cowboys and Indians\nClips and revolvers and George's and Benjamin's\nA celebration of the loss of your innocence\nTo your old self you've lost any resemblance\nThey say the city make a dark impression\nThe youth just lost and they want direction\nBut they don't get the police, they get the protection\nAnd walk around with heat like Charlton Heston, man\n\nIt's in the music, turn it up let it knock\nLet it bang on the block 'til the neighbors call the cops\nThe cops gone come but they ain't gone do shit\nThey don't want no problems, what are y'all stupid\nIt's all in the music\n\nIt's kinda ill how we grip these bitches in the Bonneville\nIt's kind of a thrill, my mind it will spill, my nine it will kill\nOf course bro like crossbow, I bring the force though\nHittin your guts splitting your torso\nIt's colder than the North Pole living unlawful\nI'm giving you a jawful Of somethin awful\nYo my theoretic is leaded, will come and set it\nThe shit bang and leave you diabetic, for paramedics\nI spit flames and get dames to get change\nWith pitbull bark and lock the shock\nDon't bother me Ock, don't you dare lie to me Ock\nI don't know, who's this nigga that you try to be Ock\nBenefit of doubt had me think you in it for clout\nBig shit, send it for route and finish him out\nJoints stiff from rigor mortis\nWhile we swimmin in waters, women with daughters\nWill have us niggas sinnin with orders", "image":

seeing don't visit there\nIt's somewhere between Jersey and Delaware\nPhilly never scared and them niggas ain't timid there\nThem young triggers lose lives by the minute there\nIt might start but the fight never finish there\nThey all fucked up tryna get the gingerbread\nA few stacks be the price for a nigga's head\nCops and robbers, cowboys and Indians\nClips and revolvers and George's and Benjamin's\nA celebration of the loss of your innocence\nTo your old self you've lost any resemblance\nThey say the city make a dark impression\nThe youth just lost and they want direction\nBut they don't get the police, they get the protection\nAnd walk around with heat like Charlton Heston, man\n\nIt's in the music, turn it up let it knock\nLet it bang on the block 'til the neighbors call the cops\nThe cops gone come but they ain't gone do shit\nThey don't want no problems, what are y'all stupid\nIt's all in the music\n\nIt's kinda ill how we grip these bitches in the Bonneville\nIt's kind of a thrill, my mind it will spill, my nine it will kill\nOf course bro like crossbow, I bring the force though\nHittin your guts splitting your torso\nIt's colder than the North Pole living unlawful\nI'm giving you a jawful Of somethin awful\nYo my theoretic is leaded, will come and set it\nThe shit bang and leave you diabetic, for paramedics\nI spit flames and get dames to get change\nWith pitbull bark and lock the shock\nDon't bother me Ock, don't you dare lie to me Ock\nI don't know, who's this nigga that you try to be Ock\nBenefit of doubt had me think you in it for clout\nBig shit, send it for route and finish him out\nJoints stiff from rigor mortis\nWhile we swimmin in waters, women with daughters\nWill have us niggas sinnin with orders"}}, {"title": "Intro",

empty repertoire\nAnother hopeless story never read at all\nI\u2019m better off looking for the end\nWhere the credits are\nIt\u2019s a pain living life against the grain\nI\u2019m looking back and y\u2019all look the same\nTroy, Mark, and little what\u2019s his name\nMemory is rerunning it all\nIt\u2019s the flight of my fall and it\u2019s right on the wall\n\nI remember\nCan you remember?\nHow it was\nI do\nRemember, do you?\n\nI used to ride the train to the same two stops\nAnd look at the graffiti on the rooftops\nLike the same song playing on the jukebox\nJoint called \u201cFaded Polaroids In A Shoebox\u201d\nRegardless to what the cadence is\nIt can\u2019t be forgotten like old acquaintances\nI realize how depressing of a place it is\nAnd when I notice my reflection whose face it is\n\nI remember\nCan you remember?\nHow it was\nI do\nRemember, do you?\n\n\nI remember\nCan you remember?\nHow it was\nI do\nRemember, do you?\n\nIt\u2019s only human to express the way you really feel\nBut that same humanity is my Achilles\u2019 heel\nA leopard can\u2019t change its spots and never will\nSo I\u2019m forever ill\nNow I can never chill\nWhat\u2019s keeping me from breaking out like Benadryl\nWhen my baptism of fire resulted in a kill\nSometimes it\u2019s as cut and dry as a business deal\nYou gotta cause the blood of a close friend to spill\nBut you remember still"}}, {"title": "It Ain't Fair", "album": "Detroit (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack)", "year": "2017-07-27", "lyrics": "Oh brother, hmm\nIt's a mystery, yeah\nWill you hear my cry?\nWon't you my plea, oh?\nCause I'll never know (I'll never know)\nHow it feels (how it feels)\nHow it feels (how it feels)\nOh, how it feels (how it feels)\nTo be\nTo be\nFree\n\nPeople swear they woke but they're walking in their sleep\nI pray the Lord their souls to keep\nBecause wolves disguised as sheep patrol our streets\nAnd we all know, that which you sow you shall reap\nThose who do know, you should teach\nThrough every loophole, we gon' leap until you reach\nA common ground and become unbound\nBecause when your whole town becomes a battleground\nTears raining down\n\nBecause it ain't fair\nIt's hard when you're looking for love\nAnd it ain't there\nOr trying to read what tomorrow holds\nWhen it ain't clear\nBecause the well is running dry\nRace tension is running high\nUnder 21 is far too young to die\nMy salvation's under fire\nThis marks a rising of the tide\n\nEvery day I wear a mask like an umpire\nGuess a nigga gotta laugh to keep from crying\nTonight another friend passed on the young side\nIt's bad 'cause a good friend's hard to come by\nJustice is never color blind, never gun shy\nFor one crime, you may never see the sun shine\nWe know of one times, giving you the finger\n'round hearing me, fuck you, it's not the number one sign\nI hear they turning downtown to the front line\nIt's something like the same place but it ain't safe\nThey took it from the human race to a tank chase\nThe Devil feeding off hate so he gain weight\nThere's tainted waters in the well, so we can't taste\nPeople dazed and amazed though it ain't grace\nImpossible to coexist in the same space\nEnter the black saint with the war paint face\n\nThis generation, we've forsaken all that's real\nWhat emotions do we feel?\nIs your poison called a pistol or a pill?\nSome people say, \"Let Jesus take the wheel\"\nOthers say, \"Thou shall not kill\"\nBut that old time religion ain't gon' pay my bills\nWe've come so far yet here we are\nBruised and scarred, presumed inferior\nWe ain't scared o' y'all\n\nIt ain't fair\nIt's hard when you're looking for love\nAnd it ain't there\nOr try to read what tomorrow holds\nWhen it ain't clear\nBecause the well is running dry\nRace tension is running high\nUnder 21 is far too young to die\nMy salvation's under fire\nRising and rising, oh!!\n\nTo my, Afro, Israelis, Native American, Mexicans\nInvested in wrestling with Willie Lynch's next to kin\nThe rising of the tide, noose around the necks again\nLook how they try to hide proof of all the excellence\nThe only tag you know me as is Holy Swag\nThrough any glass window, we

how it feels (how it feels)\nTo be\nTo be\nFree\n\nPeople swear they woke but they're walking in their sleep\nI pray the Lord their souls to keep\nBecause wolves disguised as sheep patrol our streets\nAnd we all know, that which you sow you shall reap\nThose who do know, you should teach\nThrough every loophole, we gon' leap until you reach\nA common ground and become unbound\nBecause when your whole town becomes a battleground\nTears raining down\n\nBecause it ain't fair\nIt's hard when you're looking for love\nAnd it ain't there\nOr trying to read what tomorrow holds\nWhen it ain't clear\nBecause the well is running dry\nRace tension is running high\nUnder 21 is far too young to die\nMy salvation's under fire\nThis marks a rising of the tide\n\nEvery day I wear a mask like an umpire\nGuess a nigga gotta laugh to keep from crying\nTonight another friend passed on the young side\nIt's bad 'cause a good friend's hard to come by\nJustice is never color blind, never gun shy\nFor one crime, you may never see the sun shine\nWe know of one times, giving you the finger\n'round hearing me, fuck you, it's not the number one sign\nI hear they turning downtown to the front line\nIt's something like the same place but it ain't safe\nThey took it from the human race to a tank chase\nThe Devil feeding off hate so he gain weight\nThere's tainted waters in the well, so we can't taste\nPeople dazed and amazed though it ain't grace\nImpossible to coexist in the same space\nEnter the black saint with the war paint face\n\nThis generation, we've forsaken all that's real\nWhat emotions do we feel?\nIs your poison called a pistol or a pill?\nSome people say, \"Let Jesus take the wheel\"\nOthers say, \"Thou shall not kill\"\nBut that old time religion ain't gon' pay my bills\nWe've come so far yet here we are\nBruised and scarred, presumed inferior\nWe ain't scared o' y'all\n\nIt ain't fair\nIt's hard when you're looking for love\nAnd it ain't there\nOr try to read what tomorrow holds\nWhen it ain't clear\nBecause the well is running dry\nRace tension is running high\nUnder 21 is far too young to die\nMy salvation's under fire\nRising and rising, oh!!\n\nTo my, Afro, Israelis, Native American, Mexicans\nInvested in wrestling with Willie Lynch's next to kin\nThe rising of the tide, noose around the necks again\nLook how they try to hide proof of all the excellence\nThe only tag you know me as is Holy Swag\nThrough any glass window, we smash, and bro we back\nIt's coming fast, I'm unabashed, so we have\nAn awareness of the only flag that's growing fast\nI guess I'm tryna minimize regrets, I identify with death\nThat don't mean it's not an uninvited guest\nI'm just tryna answer all of my requests\nAnd express in 140 characters or less\nWhy I'm the best educator, re-legislated, premeditated\nDedicated, heavy weight that ever paid it with blood\nNot tuition without a cop's permission\nI got a pot to piss in despite the opposition\nListen\n\nOh, it ain't fair\nIt's hard when you're looking for love\nBut it ain't there\nTry to read what tomorrow holds\nAnd it ain't clear\nBecause the well is running dry\nAnd it ain't fair\nNo, it ain't there\nNo, it ain't fair\nLooking for justice and it's just us\nIt ain't fair\nThere's a riot going on out there\nAnd it ain't fair\nWhen your protector is your predator\nIt ain't

to set it\nProfess mic techniques il-legit\nInaccurate perceptions of reality embedded\nIn they minds, thus they rhymes are discredit\nCheck it out, now!\n\nI use my music implemented with jewels and sport tools\nTo inspire all these too cool fools who say screw school\nCause they don't see the conspiracy\nThat's put here to trap you and me, but we can get out\n\nY'all know the Bad Lieutenant be on some whole 'nother other Finesse genetic, they say I get it from my mother so its' inheredit-\nAry and very necessary to shine, legendarily, heavily refined\n\nContemporaries like the Roots is so rad, it's like, dag\nWhich bag did they come out of? And how can I get in it to win it?\nLike a raffle ticket pickin'\nIf you feelin' stuck, guess who did the stickin' of your feelings, y'all?\n\nI got this Ital style up close and personal\nThe first I find to violate, I shall retal-\nIate with realism for they whole local\nTo relate, we on point like decimal, Abstract now\n\nMCin' while I'm breathin', MCin' is believin'\nThat you, can host a ceremony and the dose is never phony\nIn fact, it's quite therapeutic like a B12 hypodermic needle\nSo shoot it!\n\nLyrically elicit up steps the explicit\nMost wicked, seven digit, mic wizard\nMy tongue lash out and strike with it, just slightly might miss it\nWhen I blast through your section or district\n\n\nIn my formative years, by my peers I was influenced\nUntil the instruments of time killed the congruence\nI peeped the blueprints on how to make true sense\nOf MC's, which are a nuisance I know just what to do since\nI'm on another lev\nBrothers is fakin' jacks and think they ready for the rev\nBut they got a lot to learn, to make their thoughts long term\nCause their short-cuts, they make a wrong turn\nProbably, timelessly, I construct the fearsome\nTo rip your eardrum for many years to come\nProfession-al, style thinkin' ration-al to move wise\nSo hard, it's a wonder y'all alive ...\n\n... And still breathin', niggas is dead and not even\nPerpetratin' real life, this shit kicked is real trife\nAyo, they fake bleedin', it's obvious that they needin'\nAttention feedin', they cold actin'

up\nBut rip up, the jam and we'll be truly impressed\nOn stage you won't need your tef' vest\nOnly a mic and a mic test, and at your best\nYou get blessed by the fans who profess\nThat they can relate to the trials you tribulate\nOr the pains you endure, cause some cats is pure\nTell horrors that are true, but see cats like you\nY'all fake joints just to get a woo-hoo\nThe tear jerker, you like a

"(Everybody reppin' from the Illadelph side)\nFrom the Illadelph side (from the Illadelph side)\nTo the New York side (to the New York side\nTo the universal side to the universal side)\n\n(Abstract) I wanna be able to reach an MC\nAnd reach a little child in the same degree\nAnd my elders excel, I mean, what the hell?\nWe might as well bridge these gaps\nIn all before we fall in the fire\n\nThere's a million MCs upon a plan they call real, tryin' to set it\nProfess mic techniques il-legit\nInaccurate perceptions of reality embedded\nIn they minds, thus they rhymes are discredit\nCheck it out, now!\n\nI use my music implemented with jewels and sport tools\nTo inspire all these too cool fools who say screw school\nCause they don't see the conspiracy\nThat's put here to trap you and me, but we can get out\n\nY'all know the Bad Lieutenant be on some whole 'nother other Finesse genetic, they say I get it from my mother so its' inheredit-\nAry and very necessary to shine, legendarily, heavily refined\n\nContemporaries like the Roots is so rad, it's like, dag\nWhich bag did they come out of? And how can I get in it to win it?\nLike a raffle ticket pickin'\nIf you feelin' stuck, guess who did the stickin' of your feelings, y'all?\n\nI got this Ital style up close and personal\nThe first I find to violate, I shall retal-\nIate with realism for they whole local\nTo relate, we on point like decimal, Abstract now\n\nMCin' while I'm breathin', MCin' is believin'\nThat you, can host a ceremony and the dose is never phony\nIn fact, it's quite therapeutic like a B12 hypodermic needle\nSo shoot it!\n\nLyrically elicit up steps the explicit\nMost wicked, seven digit, mic wizard\nMy tongue lash out and strike with it, just slightly might miss it\nWhen I blast through your section or district\n\n\nIn my formative years, by my peers I was influenced\nUntil the instruments of time killed the congruence\nI peeped the blueprints on how to make true sense\nOf MC's, which are a nuisance I know just what to do since\nI'm on another lev\nBrothers is fakin' jacks and think they ready for the rev\nBut they got a lot to learn, to make their thoughts long term\nCause their short-cuts, they make a wrong turn\nProbably, timelessly, I construct the fearsome\nTo rip your eardrum for many years to come\nProfession-al, style thinkin' ration-al to move wise\nSo hard, it's a wonder y'all alive ...\n\n... And still breathin', niggas is dead and not even\nPerpetratin' real life, this shit kicked is real trife\nAyo, they fake bleedin', it's obvious that they needin'\nAttention feedin', they cold actin' like heathens\nWhen mics is picked up, MC's scenes is kicked up\nLike women with the grip up, drinking Moet 'till they hiccup\nFellas hustlin', picking bricks up\nFantasizin' about the illest stick up\nBut rip up, the jam and we'll be truly impressed\nOn stage you won't need your tef' vest\nOnly a mic and a mic test, and at your best\nYou get blessed by the fans who profess\nThat they can relate to the trials you tribulate\nOr the pains you endure, cause some cats is pure\nTell horrors that are true, but see cats like you\nY'all fake joints just to get a woo-hoo\nThe tear jerker, you like a miracle worker\nWhose miracles just ran out, I think it's time you pan out\nOr just plain fade, cause yo, you played\nWe 'bout to drop it on you like the Everglades"}}, {"title": "It Just Don't Stop",

slumped or knocked\nIt don't stop y'all, and it just don't stop\n\nI leaves the microphone intrigued with my practice\nThis rebel sticks to the system like a cactus, avoid sadness\nWho knows what is concealed under the mattress\nLugers, losses and grindles when my mind's in blackness\nThen I act this way, the beast unleashed\nRabbis, monks and priests always pray for peace\nBut it's deceased, now only lives the true real-ness\nOpen up the mental depths, you've entered through my palace\nMy thoughts contain the plus sign, plus the malice\nNot equating to your Wonderland, so fuck Alice\nMy style is hostile on the external\nBut got plenty of love and warmth that's internal\nThis sin colonel surfaces from whispers from the lower\nMy now like arks and 950 years of knowing\nYour arch rival, they burn a cross, I burn the Bible\nBecause I'm liable, to do this, when my action's crudest\nBut I'd rather choose to use my diction\nResurrect that blonde, blue-eyed\nAnd put him through another crucifixion\nStay up in your jurisdiction (say what?)\nMy depiction is the drama\nThrough these eyes, I've seen the trauma\nHomicides in the source that was phenomenal\nWhen I find out who banged Muwan in his abdominal\nMet with Jesus to learn to Burns not comical\nAt times, this thing ain't logical\nI gots to walk around with my brain on cock\nCause it can't (can't) won't (won't) don't (don't) stop, dig it!\n\n\nMy mental's inflamed, your brains will drain\nWhen I let the ink drip, and then pass out a pink slip\nI think quick, so check my methodology\nMy style-agy is more antique than anthropology\nBetween your raw legs like it's gynecology\nYou and your sorry ass style needs an apology\nCause an earthquake and make you shake, you need neurology\nThese niggas kill me actin' like stars, fuck they astrology\nImagine, with my badge, I snatch the pageant (Ha!)\nTurn your city to a smash-and-grab it\nNow it's time to burn the maggots, my message stronger than Elija\nTo back-slap that ass like your father, why bother, with any kaffir?\nLyrics I sling from my mic will cease your laughter\nMind of a bachelor to a master\nWhat I thought that leaves you flabbergasted\nAsk you what's the matter, bastard?\nThese types of rhythms, man, you'd rather blast it\nYou hear the beats in jeeps over the weekend\nSilence is golden and niggas get killed just for speakin'\nThe only beacon, is death when you're left wounded\nLayin' on the ground and meet your doom quick\nI done been through the deserts of hell, with Satan sittin', waitin'\nContemplatin', and trying to get me for the takin'\nThat's why I walk around with my brain on cock\nCause it can't (can't) won't (won't) don't (don't) stop\n\n\nAt times, I feel as if could pull a kamikaze\nIlluminati rally in the Civic center lobby\nThey seeds in the world student body probably\nCreatin' missiles, they got my child holdin' pistols\nKnowledge and understand will make a man murder\nStand further, fuck all the swine, plus the hamburger\nNo hallucinant, the Lieutenant, plus Illitant\nAryan murder that's mental, credentials is I am a hell residential With fire for the presidential, eventually, it's havoc in the temple\nI terrorize the heavens, bring on the renaissance\nWith the sevens, and civilize the reverence\nReprimand the deacon, keepin' 'em from speakin''\nTell 'em cease the false preachin'\nI step, like a shadow on the way to hot concrete\nAnd observe, my peoples in the essence every weekend\nWe wonder, what the fuck is schools teachin'?\nIntoxicated soldiers in chaotic times reachin'\nThe dynasty is sim, but we only resemble what's grim\nWe attack, to split your back then we extort your specimen\nI put this in your system like lecithin\nThen maneuver mentally from in-ternal medicine\nI hold the fort down with Malik\nSymbolic to the bond of word that's Islamic\nThe killer forces, I deposit, dealin' with logic\nI keep my brain on cock, it don't stop\n\nBad

size and shape\nYou can walk don't the block and get slumped or knocked\nIt don't stop y'all, and it just don't stop\n\nI leaves the microphone intrigued with my practice\nThis rebel sticks to the system like a cactus, avoid sadness\nWho knows what is concealed under the mattress\nLugers, losses and grindles when my mind's in blackness\nThen I act this way, the beast unleashed\nRabbis, monks and priests always pray for peace\nBut it's deceased, now only lives the true real-ness\nOpen up the mental depths, you've entered through my palace\nMy thoughts contain the plus sign, plus the malice\nNot equating to your Wonderland, so fuck Alice\nMy style is hostile on the external\nBut got plenty of love and warmth that's internal\nThis sin colonel surfaces from whispers from the lower\nMy now like arks and 950 years of knowing\nYour arch rival, they burn a cross, I burn the Bible\nBecause I'm liable, to do this, when my action's crudest\nBut I'd rather choose to use my diction\nResurrect that blonde, blue-eyed\nAnd put him through another crucifixion\nStay up in your jurisdiction (say what?)\nMy depiction is the drama\nThrough these eyes, I've seen the trauma\nHomicides in the source that was phenomenal\nWhen I find out who banged Muwan in his abdominal\nMet with Jesus to learn to Burns not comical\nAt times, this thing ain't logical\nI gots to walk around with my brain on cock\nCause it can't (can't) won't (won't) don't (don't) stop, dig it!\n\n\nMy mental's inflamed, your brains will drain\nWhen I let the ink drip, and then pass out a pink slip\nI think quick, so check my methodology\nMy style-agy is more antique than anthropology\nBetween your raw legs like it's gynecology\nYou and your sorry ass style needs an apology\nCause an earthquake and make you shake, you need neurology\nThese niggas kill me actin' like stars, fuck they astrology\nImagine, with my badge, I snatch the pageant (Ha!)\nTurn your city to a smash-and-grab it\nNow it's time to burn the maggots, my message stronger than Elija\nTo back-slap that ass like your father, why bother, with any kaffir?\nLyrics I sling from my mic will cease your laughter\nMind of a bachelor to a master\nWhat I thought that leaves you flabbergasted\nAsk you what's the matter, bastard?\nThese types of rhythms, man, you'd rather blast it\nYou hear the beats in jeeps over the weekend\nSilence is golden and niggas get killed just for speakin'\nThe only beacon, is death when you're left wounded\nLayin' on the ground and meet your doom quick\nI done been through the deserts of hell, with Satan sittin', waitin'\nContemplatin', and trying to get me for the takin'\nThat's why I walk around with my brain on cock\nCause it can't (can't) won't (won't) don't (don't) stop\n\n\nAt times, I feel as if could pull a kamikaze\nIlluminati rally in the Civic center lobby\nThey seeds in the world student body probably\nCreatin' missiles, they got my child holdin' pistols\nKnowledge and understand will make a man murder\nStand further, fuck all the swine, plus the hamburger\nNo hallucinant, the Lieutenant, plus Illitant\nAryan murder that's mental, credentials is I am a hell residential With fire for the presidential, eventually, it's havoc in the temple\nI terrorize the heavens, bring on the renaissance\nWith the sevens, and civilize the reverence\nReprimand the deacon, keepin' 'em from speakin''\nTell 'em cease the false preachin'\nI step, like a shadow on the way to hot concrete\nAnd observe, my peoples in the essence every weekend\nWe wonder, what the fuck is schools teachin'?\nIntoxicated soldiers in chaotic times reachin'\nThe dynasty is sim, but we only resemble what's grim\nWe attack, to split your back then we extort your specimen\nI put this in your system like lecithin\nThen maneuver mentally from in-ternal medicine\nI hold the fort down with Malik\nSymbolic to the bond of word that's Islamic\nThe killer forces, I deposit, dealin' with logic\nI keep my brain on cock, it don't stop\n\nBad Lieutenant, M-Ill-it-ant, feel the Fifth guerilla chant\nCome through, ???"}}, {"title": "It's Comin'", "album":

it, I don't worry, I don't sweat it\nYou can bitch, you can dead it, you can take it there like FedEx\nNothing sweet diabetic, big dog can't pet it\nPack an L then I wet it then I fill it till it's pregnant\n(Take the high back) face it everybody got a favorite\nI embrace it like I date it but my grandma think I chase it\n(Like oh yeah) I told her that her baby moving slower\nCuz the world is on his shoulders then I woke up out that coma\n(And got right back) at it with a little black 'matic\nLay you down craft-matic, then I'm gone, black magic\n(To the hideout) you don't want to gamble with the devil\nEspecially when them chewy blueys got me on another level\nCuz my teacher think I'm slow but my momma think I'm special\nBut even she know I'm coming back like an echo\n\n\nFor the statements I'm about to make I will not apologize\nNiggas talk a lot of shit, really need to stop the lies\nJewels rented, cars rented, homie that ain't authentic\nActing tough on TV but to me you seem a little timid\nDon't blame the nigga, blame America, it's all business\nActing like a monkey is the only way to sell tickets\nShit I can dig it, niggas gossip silly digits\nWhite kids buy it, it's a riot when we talking about pimping\nOr sipping on old English brew or whatever they think we do\nSpraying double Uzis cuz you know they think we live in zoos\nThe problem is with this everyone seems to be real confused\nThe niggas on the streets to the old people that watch the news\nAnd watch BET and the crazy shit they see\nThey associate with you do the same shit to me\nWhen you look at me you see just a nigga from the projects\nBut can't understand this nigga's mind set but still\n\n\nYo, a revolution's what it's smelling like, it ain't going be televised\nGovernments is hellified, taking cake and selling pies\nI ain't got a crust or crumb, to get some I'd be well obliged\nMurder is comodified, felon for the second time\nNever was I into chasing trouble I was followed by\nFacing trouble with no alibi, had to swallow pride\nVilified, victimized, penalized, criticized\nRan into some people that's surprised I was still alive\nLook into my daughter's eyes, wonder how can I provide\nGot to get from A to B but how can I afford to drive?\nMessed around, tried to get a job and wasn't qualified\nHad to see a pal of mine, got to get the lightning rod\nNow I'm in the black Impala looking for the dollar sign\nPalms get the itching man I got to get the calamine\nBefore I fall behind, guess the grind will be my 9 to 5\nI will not be conquered by, I will not apologize",

won't\n(I will not apologize) I will not apologize\n(I will not apologize) I will not apologize\nThis is for all of my peoples who understand and truly recognize\nSome won't get it for that I won't apologize\n\nI'm so sick cause I'm infected but but I don't need a medic\nNeed a liquid anesthetic, let me show you how I get it\nI don't got it but I bet it, I don't worry, I don't sweat it\nYou can bitch, you can dead it, you can take it there like FedEx\nNothing sweet diabetic, big dog can't pet it\nPack an L then I wet it then I fill it till it's pregnant\n(Take the high back) face it everybody got a favorite\nI embrace it like I date it but my grandma think I chase it\n(Like oh yeah) I told her that her baby moving slower\nCuz the world is on his shoulders then I woke up out that coma\n(And got right back) at it with a little black 'matic\nLay you down craft-matic, then I'm gone, black magic\n(To the hideout) you don't want to gamble with the devil\nEspecially when them chewy blueys got me on another level\nCuz my teacher think I'm slow but my momma think I'm special\nBut even she know I'm coming back like an echo\n\n\nFor the statements I'm about to make I will not apologize\nNiggas talk a lot of shit, really need to stop the lies\nJewels rented, cars rented, homie that ain't authentic\nActing tough on TV but to me you seem a little timid\nDon't blame the nigga, blame America, it's all business\nActing like a monkey is the only way to sell tickets\nShit I can dig it, niggas gossip silly digits\nWhite kids buy it, it's a riot when we talking about pimping\nOr sipping on old English brew or whatever they think we do\nSpraying double Uzis cuz you know they think we live in zoos\nThe problem is with this everyone seems to be real confused\nThe niggas on the streets to the old people that watch the news\nAnd watch BET and the crazy shit they see\nThey associate with you do the same shit to me\nWhen you look at me you see just a nigga from the projects\nBut can't understand this nigga's mind set but still\n\n\nYo, a revolution's what it's smelling like, it ain't going be televised\nGovernments is hellified, taking cake and selling pies\nI ain't got a crust or crumb, to get some I'd be well obliged\nMurder is comodified, felon for the second time\nNever was I into chasing trouble I was followed by\nFacing trouble with no alibi, had to swallow pride\nVilified, victimized, penalized, criticized\nRan into some people that's surprised I was still alive\nLook into my daughter's eyes, wonder how can I provide\nGot to get from A to B but how can I afford to drive?\nMessed around, tried to get a job and wasn't qualified\nHad to see a pal of mine, got to get the lightning rod\nNow I'm in the black Impala looking for the dollar sign\nPalms get the itching man I got to get the calamine\nBefore I fall behind, guess the grind will be my 9 to 5\nI will not be conquered by, I will not apologize"}}, {"title": "Kool On", "album":

bluff\nIt\u2019s a full house\u2026 sipping on a royal flush\nTwo queens is on my cuffs\nGood times is in the cards\nLiving on borrowed time\nI\u2019m paying the extra charge\nTo feel like something small is worth a hundred large\nSwag is on retard, charm is on massage\nWit is on guard, I challenge you to a duel\nWho needs a chain when every thought's a jewel\nGod bless the weirdo when everyone\u2019s a fool\nFuck a genie and three wishes\nI just want a bottle, a place to write my novel\nI am heroin to those that hear a rhyme and think\nHow do you find this upper echelon this time\nLet\u2019s toast to better days, a beautiful mind, and a flow that never age\n\n\nYo, I\u2019m never sleeping like I\u2019m on meth-amphtamines\nMove like my enemy ten steps ahead of me\nSay my reputation precede me like a pedigree\nGentlemanly gangsta steez beyond the seventies\nHoldin' fast money\nWithout running out of patience\nMove in silence without running up in places\nCake by the layers\nRich but never famous\nHustle anonymous still remain nameless\nIn hindsight gold come in bars like a Klondike\nThe minute before the storm hit is what I\u2019m calm like\nSuited and booted for a shooting like it\u2019s prom night\nIt\u2019s suicide right pursuers tried like\nTo no avail and a heroes what they died like\nI\u2019ve got em waiting on the news like I\u2019m Cronkite\nNot in the lime light or needed for crime right\nNo boasts, just bodied and chalked close to the line tight\n\n\nYeah outside where the killers and the dealers swarm\nAnd inside they dressed up like it\u2019s a telethon\nBlack tie affair but they holding heavy arms\nStraight cash with a stash in the cummerbund\nMore Bacardi and the Bastards of the Party, huh?\nRiots erupting around and still we party on\nMade the quantum leap to a king from a pawn\nBut it was destined the conclusion was foregone\nSerenade of the former slave promenade\nCause them long days in the sun\nHave now become shade\nSo we doing high speeds in a narrow lane\nSay cheese\nFree falling from the aeroplane\nAnother feather in the cap for all the years\nThat we spent in luxury's lap\nWithout looking back\nCause memories could sting like a hornet\nDamn it felt good to see people up on it", "image": "https://images.genius.com/bb007a34227e5b87c6581b2f3722077e.1000x1000x1.jpg", "artist": "The Roots", "raw":

three-piece tux\nScreaming dressed to kill\nHope somebody call my bluff\nIt\u2019s a full house\u2026 sipping on a royal flush\nTwo queens is on my cuffs\nGood times is in the cards\nLiving on borrowed time\nI\u2019m paying the extra charge\nTo feel like something small is worth a hundred large\nSwag is on retard, charm is on massage\nWit is on guard, I challenge you to a duel\nWho needs a chain when every thought's a jewel\nGod bless the weirdo when everyone\u2019s a fool\nFuck a genie and three wishes\nI just want a bottle, a place to write my novel\nI am heroin to those that hear a rhyme and think\nHow do you find this upper echelon this time\nLet\u2019s toast to better days, a beautiful mind, and a flow that never age\n\n\nYo, I\u2019m never sleeping like I\u2019m on meth-amphtamines\nMove like my enemy ten steps ahead of me\nSay my reputation precede me like a pedigree\nGentlemanly gangsta steez beyond the seventies\nHoldin' fast money\nWithout running out of patience\nMove in silence without running up in places\nCake by the layers\nRich but never famous\nHustle anonymous still remain nameless\nIn hindsight gold come in bars like a Klondike\nThe minute before the storm hit is what I\u2019m calm like\nSuited and booted for a shooting like it\u2019s prom night\nIt\u2019s suicide right pursuers tried like\nTo no avail and a heroes what they died like\nI\u2019ve got em waiting on the news like I\u2019m Cronkite\nNot in the lime light or needed for crime right\nNo boasts, just bodied and chalked close to the line tight\n\n\nYeah outside where the killers and the dealers swarm\nAnd inside they dressed up like it\u2019s a telethon\nBlack tie affair but they holding heavy arms\nStraight cash with a stash in the cummerbund\nMore Bacardi and the Bastards of the Party, huh?\nRiots erupting around and still we party on\nMade the quantum leap to a king from a pawn\nBut it was destined the conclusion was foregone\nSerenade of the former slave promenade\nCause them long days in the sun\nHave now become shade\nSo we doing high speeds in a narrow lane\nSay cheese\nFree falling from the aeroplane\nAnother feather in the cap for all the years\nThat we spent in luxury's lap\nWithout looking back\nCause memories could sting like a hornet\nDamn it felt good to see people up on it"}}, {"title": "Lazy Afternoon", "album": "Do You Want

the Jeep pumpin' beats for your rump\nIn the summertime I'm risin' to the shine at 12:20\nGhetto streets are sunny, niggas is gettin' money\nIt's mad hot, and what I got to do I'm not sure of\nI call up Maura, this dip I know from Bora Bora\nWas rappin' for a second about what I reckoned that I\nWas doin' at six, she was invitin' me to the flicks\nThat I'm with, blew a kiss  Now I'm in the shower\nI meant the bath in which I simmer for half an hour\nThen got drier, put on attire to inspire\nHit my dresser for numbers of women that I admire\nLaid around and lounged 'til around two\nThen I got up and ate, drank a brew and caught a page from the crew\nSayin' \"Where ya at? Later, meet us up at the Plat\nBring a sack, ayo it's Saturday, it's gonna be fat\"\nNow it's 3:37 and I still ain't left the rest\nElectric Relaxation from A Tribe Called Quest\nWith the boom, tokin', smokin', coolin' out\nAs I parlay in my room cause it's a lazy afternoon\n\nIt's a lazy afternoon\n(Summertime, as I recline, lay back and relax, let the sun shine)\n\nOther verses as Verse 1, with the following variations:\nVerse 2: \"this dip I knew from Bora Bora\"\n\"cause it's a lazy aaaaaahh!\" (dental style :-)\nVerse 3: \" I'm in the shower\"\n\"a page from my crew\"\n\"Bring a

for your rump\nIn the summertime I'm risin' to the shine at 12:20\nGhetto streets are sunny, niggas is gettin' money\nIt's mad hot, and what I got to do I'm not sure of\nI call up Maura, this dip I know from Bora Bora\nWas rappin' for a second about what I reckoned that I\nWas doin' at six, she was invitin' me to the flicks\nThat I'm with, blew a kiss  Now I'm in the shower\nI meant the bath in which I simmer for half an hour\nThen got drier, put on attire to inspire\nHit my dresser for numbers of women that I admire\nLaid around and lounged 'til around two\nThen I got up and ate, drank a brew and caught a page from the crew\nSayin' \"Where ya at? Later, meet us up at the Plat\nBring a sack, ayo it's Saturday, it's gonna be fat\"\nNow it's 3:37 and I still ain't left the rest\nElectric Relaxation from A Tribe Called Quest\nWith the boom, tokin', smokin', coolin' out\nAs I parlay in my room cause it's a lazy afternoon\n\nIt's a lazy afternoon\n(Summertime, as I recline, lay back and relax, let the sun shine)\n\nOther verses as Verse 1, with the following variations:\nVerse 2: \"this dip I knew from Bora Bora\"\n\"cause it's a lazy aaaaaahh!\" (dental style :-)\nVerse 3: \" I'm in the shower\"\n\"a page from my crew\"\n\"Bring a sack, nigga, it's Saturday\""}}, {"title": "Leonard I-V", "album": "Organix", "year": "1993-05-19", "lyrics": "From The Never Never Tunnels via satellite\nCeremonies be commencing in the candlelight\nYo is I is up in the res-in-iduals tonight\nAbsolutely because I'm the kid that's on the mic\nAnd I believe it's destiny that I got put\nIn a position to throw lyrics like a shotput\nYo no matter the circumstance\nThought can always make you dance\nLike you got the heebie-jeebies or a hotfoot\nThe bass is low on the meter, less than zero\nSo while I'm sinning you be spinning like a planet\nYo if you dig the shit I'm sayin you'll be deeper\nWish for little and your wishes shall be granted\nWe plant the seeds y'all, to grow The Roots y'all\nAnd mad knowledge I got, from the archives\nBut now I got a crazy fat question:\nWhat ever happened to Leonard Parts One to Five?\nChorus: Black Thought (repeat 2X)\nWhy'd you ask me that question? (I don't know)\nWhere did Leonard Parts One to Five go?\nWhy'd you ask me that question? (I don't know)\nWord/Uhh/Yeah/...\nWhere did Leonard Parts One to Five go..\n\nChariot, Chariot, come swing low--be\nCause it's on a lower level that I swing low, umm\n?uestion, keeps me up, on the swing flow, he\nDon't got a whole name, I call him, BRO The\nRoots is comin through on your audio\nFor you to cut The Roots down I don't think so\nBecause the sound from the ground is like be--low\nAnd when the liquid kicks in then The Roots grow\nNow my ace boom coon plus amigo\nWas Shadrach Meshach and Abendago\nThere was a Alpha to Omega, motion, system\nBut I just call them A to O\nAnd in all states, The Roots'll rock a fat show\nBecause I drop art like I was Pa-blo\nAnd Pa-blo's last name was Picasso\nBut as for cash flow, I don't got no\nDividends and, ends to spend on blow, yo\nWhere did Leonard Parts to Five go?\nChorus\n\nWhere's the third verse? Here it comes, here it goes\nThe second had Oodles and Oodles of..\nSpeaking of O's, I'm hard to sink like a Cheerio\nAnd I speak up loud, so you can hear me yo\nIs it A Tribe Called Quest? Is it the JBs?\nWe're Cool Like Dat, but yo we're not the D.P.'s\nIt's the group The Roots, with the organic rap style\nPlus the groove from the rhythmic rhyme file\nUmm.. I'm a big fan of the Soul\nBut I'm trying to get this Roots shit in control\nSo I hate when people say\n\"Umm - you remind me of De La Soul,\"\nCause I got a soul, of my own, and umm\nYo The Roots are taking big steps and\nYou can listen as we progress in\nSometimes I might come to teach a lesson\nOther times it's with a crazy question like..\nYo.. whatever happened to Leonard Parts One to Five?\nWord up; I don't know, anyway, Roots up y'know\nUhh, as we do it like this\nRoots up, Roots up\nRoots up, Roots up\nRoots up, Roots up\nRoots up, Roots up\nRoots up.. up, Roots up-up\nRoots up, Roots up-up\nRoots up, Roots up-up\nRoots up, Roots _Up From the Ground_\nRoots up, Roots up with the sound\nRoots up, Roots _Up From the Ground_\nRoots up, Roots gettin on down\nRoots up, dig

the candlelight\nYo is I is up in the res-in-iduals tonight\nAbsolutely because I'm the kid that's on the mic\nAnd I believe it's destiny that I got put\nIn a position to throw lyrics like a shotput\nYo no matter the circumstance\nThought can always make you dance\nLike you got the heebie-jeebies or a hotfoot\nThe bass is low on the meter, less than zero\nSo while I'm sinning you be spinning like a planet\nYo if you dig the shit I'm sayin you'll be deeper\nWish for little and your wishes shall be granted\nWe plant the seeds y'all, to grow The Roots y'all\nAnd mad knowledge I got, from the archives\nBut now I got a crazy fat question:\nWhat ever happened to Leonard Parts One to Five?\nChorus: Black Thought (repeat 2X)\nWhy'd you ask me that question? (I don't know)\nWhere did Leonard Parts One to Five go?\nWhy'd you ask me that question? (I don't know)\nWord/Uhh/Yeah/...\nWhere did Leonard Parts One to Five go..\n\nChariot, Chariot, come swing low--be\nCause it's on a lower level that I swing low, umm\n?uestion, keeps me up, on the swing flow, he\nDon't got a whole name, I call him, BRO The\nRoots is comin through on your audio\nFor you to cut The Roots down I don't think so\nBecause the sound from the ground is like be--low\nAnd when the liquid kicks in then The Roots grow\nNow my ace boom coon plus amigo\nWas Shadrach Meshach and Abendago\nThere was a Alpha to Omega, motion, system\nBut I just call them A to O\nAnd in all states, The Roots'll rock a fat show\nBecause I drop art like I was Pa-blo\nAnd Pa-blo's last name was Picasso\nBut as for cash flow, I don't got no\nDividends and, ends to spend on blow, yo\nWhere did Leonard Parts to Five go?\nChorus\n\nWhere's the third verse? Here it comes, here it goes\nThe second had Oodles and Oodles of..\nSpeaking of O's, I'm hard to sink like a Cheerio\nAnd I speak up loud, so you can hear me yo\nIs it A Tribe Called Quest? Is it the JBs?\nWe're Cool Like Dat, but yo we're not the D.P.'s\nIt's the group The Roots, with the organic rap style\nPlus the groove from the rhythmic rhyme file\nUmm.. I'm a big fan of the Soul\nBut I'm trying to get this Roots shit in control\nSo I hate when people say\n\"Umm - you remind me of De La Soul,\"\nCause I got a soul, of my own, and umm\nYo The Roots are taking big steps and\nYou can listen as we progress in\nSometimes I might come to teach a lesson\nOther times it's with a crazy question like..\nYo.. whatever happened to Leonard Parts One to Five?\nWord up; I don't know, anyway, Roots up y'know\nUhh, as we do it like this\nRoots up, Roots up\nRoots up, Roots up\nRoots up, Roots up\nRoots up, Roots up\nRoots up.. up, Roots up-up\nRoots up, Roots up-up\nRoots up, Roots up-up\nRoots up, Roots _Up From the Ground_\nRoots up, Roots up with the sound\nRoots up, Roots _Up From the Ground_\nRoots up, Roots gettin on down\nRoots up, dig it\nRoots up y'all, Roots up y'all\nRoots is up Roots is up Roots is up y'all\nRoots is up y'all, Roots is up y'all\nRoots is up Roots is up Roots is up y'all\nRoots is up.."}}, {"title":

like you just screamed\nIt\u2019s no one there to hear the sound\nAnd it may feel like there\u2019s no one there\nThat cares if you drown\nFace down in the ocean\n\nSmoking cheap weed sipping on cheap vodka\nYou pick your poison down Davy Jones\u2019 locker\nIt\u2019s rum we be wanting\nBy the tons my consumption\nTake a look at my lungs and my liver\nIt\u2019s disgusting\nTake a look at the man in the mirror\nWe start fussing\nOnly one person gets hurt when throwing the punches\nMe\nAnd the man behind the glass just laughs\nThe waves come over my head and just crash\nMy hand start bleeding water starts receeding\nA feeling comes into my heart I start believing that\nI actually might survive through the evening\nSurvive on my own thoughts of suicide that\u2019s competing\nWith thoughts of tryna stay alive which been weakened\nBy the feeling of putting on a smile while being beaten\nThe fear of drowning still diving in the deep end\nThe waters carried me so far you can\u2019t reach \u2018em\nAnd it feels like there\u2019s no one\n\nAnd no one\u2019s in the lighthouse\nYou\u2019re face down in the ocean\nAnd no one\u2019s in the lighthouse\nAnd it seems like you just screamed\nIt\u2019s no one there to hear the sound\nAnd it may feel like there\u2019s no one there\nThat cares if you drown\nFace down in the ocean\n\nAfter the love is lost\nFriendship dissolves\nAnd even blood is lost\nWhere did it begin\nThe way we did each other wrong\nTroubled water neither one of us could swim across\nI stopped holding my breath\nNow am I better off\nThere without a trace\nAnd you in my head\nAll the halted motion of a rebel without a pause\nWhat it do is done till you dead and gone\nThe grim reaper telling me to swim deeper\nWhere the people go to -- lo and behold, the soul keeper\nI\u2019m not even breaking out in a sweat\nOr cold fever but\nI\u2019m never paying up on my debt or tolls either\nI\u2019ll leave the memories here I won\u2019t need them\nIf I stop thinking and lie, now that\u2019s freedom\nYour body\u2019s part of the Maritime museum\nFace down in the past is where I\u2019m being\n\nAnd no one\u2019s in the lighthouse\nYou\u2019re face down in the ocean\nAnd no one\u2019s in the lighthouse\nAnd it seems like you just screamed\nIt\u2019s no one there to hear the sound\nAnd it may feel like there\u2019s no one there\nThat cares if you

to go didown\nGet down with the captain or go down with the ship\nBefore the dark abyss I\u2019m gon\u2019 hit you wit dis\n\nAnd no one\u2019s in the lighthouse\nYou\u2019re face down in the ocean\nAnd no one\u2019s in the lighthouse\nAnd it seems like you just screamed\nIt\u2019s no one there to hear the sound\nAnd it may feel like there\u2019s no one there\nThat cares if you drown\nFace down in the ocean\n\nSmoking cheap weed sipping on cheap vodka\nYou pick your poison down Davy Jones\u2019 locker\nIt\u2019s rum we be wanting\nBy the tons my consumption\nTake a look at my lungs and my liver\nIt\u2019s disgusting\nTake a look at the man in the mirror\nWe start fussing\nOnly one person gets hurt when throwing the punches\nMe\nAnd the man behind the glass just laughs\nThe waves come over my head and just crash\nMy hand start bleeding water starts receeding\nA feeling comes into my heart I start believing that\nI actually might survive through the evening\nSurvive on my own thoughts of suicide that\u2019s competing\nWith thoughts of tryna stay alive which been weakened\nBy the feeling of putting on a smile while being beaten\nThe fear of drowning still diving in the deep end\nThe waters carried me so far you can\u2019t reach \u2018em\nAnd it feels like there\u2019s no one\n\nAnd no one\u2019s in the lighthouse\nYou\u2019re face down in the ocean\nAnd no one\u2019s in the lighthouse\nAnd it seems like you just screamed\nIt\u2019s no one there to hear the sound\nAnd it may feel like there\u2019s no one there\nThat cares if you drown\nFace down in the ocean\n\nAfter the love is lost\nFriendship dissolves\nAnd even blood is lost\nWhere did it begin\nThe way we did each other wrong\nTroubled water neither one of us could swim across\nI stopped holding my breath\nNow am I better off\nThere without a trace\nAnd you in my head\nAll the halted motion of a rebel without a pause\nWhat it do is done till you dead and gone\nThe grim reaper telling me to swim deeper\nWhere the people go to -- lo and behold, the soul keeper\nI\u2019m not even breaking out in a sweat\nOr cold fever but\nI\u2019m never paying up on my debt or tolls either\nI\u2019ll leave the memories here I won\u2019t need them\nIf I stop thinking and lie, now that\u2019s freedom\nYour body\u2019s part of the Maritime museum\nFace down in the past is where I\u2019m being\n\nAnd no one\u2019s in the lighthouse\nYou\u2019re face down in the ocean\nAnd no one\u2019s in the lighthouse\nAnd it seems like you just screamed\nIt\u2019s no one there to hear the sound\nAnd it may feel like there\u2019s no one there\nThat cares if you drown\nFace down in the ocean\n\nIf you can\u2018t swizzim then ya bound to drizzown\nPassing out life jackets bout to go didown\nGet down with the captain or go down with the ship\nBefore the dark abyss I\u2019m gon\u2019 hit you wit dis\nIf you can\u2018t swizzim then ya bound to drizzown\nPassing out life jackets bout to go didown\nGet down

ain't hardly nowhere to hide\nThey hear you when you whisperin so try to keep quiet\nYou don't even realize that youse a twinkle in the all-seein' eye\nFrom the time you in the bar gettin high\nTo havin conversations on your phone through the wire\nYou can't drive but it's definitely footage of your ride\nLivin in this day and time, it's a funny kind of vibe\nFrom the corners of the ceiling feel its eyes in back of me\nI couldn't tell you why I think they constantly after me\nMaybe it's cause the news put it to me so graphically\nHow niggas don't obey no laws, not even gravity boy\nNo benefit of doubt he had to be wrong\nHe from the corner where they known to get they casualty on\nAnother day another scene to perform, spotlight him on Friday\nCome and lock him up Saturday morn,

high-powered lenses on the cameras outside\nIt ain't nowhere to run it ain't hardly nowhere to hide\nThey hear you when you whisperin so try to keep quiet\nYou don't even realize that youse a twinkle in the all-seein' eye\nFrom the time you in the bar gettin high\nTo havin conversations on your phone through the wire\nYou can't drive but it's definitely footage of your ride\nLivin in this day and time, it's a funny kind of vibe\nFrom the corners of the ceiling feel its eyes in back of me\nI couldn't tell you why I think they constantly after me\nMaybe it's cause the news put it to me so graphically\nHow niggas don't obey no laws, not even gravity boy\nNo benefit of doubt he had to be wrong\nHe from the corner where they known to get they casualty on\nAnother day another scene to perform, spotlight him on Friday\nCome and lock him up Saturday morn, c'mon"}}, {"title": "Long Time", "album": "Game Theory", "year": "2006-08-29", "lyrics": "Oooh\nIt's been a long time\nSince I been back around the way\nIt's been a long time\nLet it spin let spin let it spin\nSince I been back around your way\nIt's been a long time\nLong time long time\n\nStruck by the luck of the draw\nReal life preservation, what I'm hustling for\nMy name Black Thought, the definition of raw\nI was born in South Philly on a cement floor\nWe had nothing at all, I had to knuckle and brawl\nThey swore I'd fall or be another brick in the wall\nAnother life full of love that lost\nThat's silly, this Philly, y'all really ain't stoppin the bull\nWith the pen like Willie on top of the hall\nPure soul is what the city most popular for\nHear the tones that will ease you\nSmooth as Bunny Sigler's soundtrack\nKeepin your head boppin and all\nAnd it's something in the water where I come from\nThey used to sing it on the corner where I come from\nMaking somethin outta nothing because everybody fifty cents away\nFrom a quarter where I come from\nYeah the streets ain't timid but I feel at home in it\nGotta see a couple people, I ain't got at in a minute\nYeah, you can take a brother outta South Philly\nCan't take it outta him really\nI forever represent it\n\nOooh\nIt's been a long time\nSince I been back around the way\nIt's been a long time\nLet it spin let spin let it spin\nSince I been back around your way\nIt's been a long time\nLong time long time\n\nLive and direct, I don't need no mic check\nRemember mommy told me \"Peedi, you ain't write that!\"\nIt started in the bathroom taking a dump\nListening to Ultramagnetic ego tripping you won't\nQuestion my word, I'm the urban version of you chump\nStomped on a different ground, sound second to none\nSynthesizers tweet to improvise your feet\nI calculated every lyric to arrive on a beat\nIt's free, come get high on me\nBefore a nine millimeter shell hit my pelle pelle in the P\nAnd yeah it's somethin in the water where I come from\nThey used to sing it on the corner where I come from\nMaking somethin outta nothing because everybody fifty cents away\nFrom a quarter where I come from\nIt's just a natural reaction for crack to make it happen\nLet the pen ink sink into the paper of the pad\nThink back when I was younger\nGhetto could have took me under but\nPeedi can't mess with North Philly, never had\nYou don't know about me, you ain't stroll my streets\nLook familiar, I feel ya, long time no see\n\nOooh\nIt's been a long time\nSince I been back around the way\nIt's been a long time\nLet it spin let spin let it spin\nSince I been back around your way\nIt's been a long time\nLong time long time\n\nClap something but whatever you clap\nClap to the record spinning while I'm taking you back\nTo the top paper era, baby dig on that\nPicture the pool room where the money getters was at\nAnd street people with the feathers in the cap of their Borsalino\nPulling paper in as if it's a small casino\nI was a young boy sweeping the floors\nAnd runnin to stores\nBut all those old heads would talk to me though\nAbout the way to clutch the eagle on a buck and tuck\nAnd if I'm down how to get back up\nJust survival kid, and it's a struggle worldwide, I'm positive\nShit the ghetto might as well be the Gaza Strip\nYou know where all of the monsters is\nStreet walkers, you don't see no consciousness\nI'm coming back to where the core of the problem is\nWe on the job again, y'all know what time it is\n\nOooh\nIt's been a long time\nSince I been back around the way\nIt's been a long time\nLet it spin let spin let it spin\nSince I been back around your way\nIt's been a long time\nLong

it spin let spin let it spin\nSince I been back around your way\nIt's been a long time\nLong time long time\n\nStruck by the luck of the draw\nReal life preservation, what I'm hustling for\nMy name Black Thought, the definition of raw\nI was born in South Philly on a cement floor\nWe had nothing at all, I had to knuckle and brawl\nThey swore I'd fall or be another brick in the wall\nAnother life full of love that lost\nThat's silly, this Philly, y'all really ain't stoppin the bull\nWith the pen like Willie on top of the hall\nPure soul is what the city most popular for\nHear the tones that will ease you\nSmooth as Bunny Sigler's soundtrack\nKeepin your head boppin and all\nAnd it's something in the water where I come from\nThey used to sing it on the corner where I come from\nMaking somethin outta nothing because everybody fifty cents away\nFrom a quarter where I come from\nYeah the streets ain't timid but I feel at home in it\nGotta see a couple people, I ain't got at in a minute\nYeah, you can take a brother outta South Philly\nCan't take it outta him really\nI forever represent it\n\nOooh\nIt's been a long time\nSince I been back around the way\nIt's been a long time\nLet it spin let spin let it spin\nSince I been back around your way\nIt's been a long time\nLong time long time\n\nLive and direct, I don't need no mic check\nRemember mommy told me \"Peedi, you ain't write that!\"\nIt started in the bathroom taking a dump\nListening to Ultramagnetic ego tripping you won't\nQuestion my word, I'm the urban version of you chump\nStomped on a different ground, sound second to none\nSynthesizers tweet to improvise your feet\nI calculated every lyric to arrive on a beat\nIt's free, come get high on me\nBefore a nine millimeter shell hit my pelle pelle in the P\nAnd yeah it's somethin in the water where I come from\nThey used to sing it on the corner where I come from\nMaking somethin outta nothing because everybody fifty cents away\nFrom a quarter where I come from\nIt's just a natural reaction for crack to make it happen\nLet the pen ink sink into the paper of the pad\nThink back when I was younger\nGhetto could have took me under but\nPeedi can't mess with North Philly, never had\nYou don't know about me, you ain't stroll my streets\nLook familiar, I feel ya, long time no see\n\nOooh\nIt's been a long time\nSince I been back around the way\nIt's been a long time\nLet it spin let spin let it spin\nSince I been back around your way\nIt's been a long time\nLong time long time\n\nClap something but whatever you clap\nClap to the record spinning while I'm taking you back\nTo the top paper era, baby dig on that\nPicture the pool room where the money getters was at\nAnd street people with the feathers in the cap of their Borsalino\nPulling paper in as if it's a small casino\nI was a young boy sweeping the floors\nAnd runnin to stores\nBut all those old heads would talk to me though\nAbout the way to clutch the eagle on a buck and tuck\nAnd if I'm down how to get back up\nJust survival kid, and it's a struggle worldwide, I'm positive\nShit the ghetto might as well be the Gaza Strip\nYou know where all of the monsters is\nStreet walkers, you don't see no consciousness\nI'm coming back to where the core of the problem is\nWe on the job again, y'all know what time it is\n\nOooh\nIt's been a long time\nSince I been back around the way\nIt's been a long time\nLet it spin let spin let it spin\nSince I been back around your way\nIt's been a long time\nLong time long time"}}, {"title": "Lost Desire", "album":

forfeit\nY'all just bullshit while I knock a nigga off quick\nY'all start speaking in tongues and start reaching for guns\nA militant will put this heat in your lungs\nThe street and the slums, the weekend is done\nThe local class always show you what heat is become\nThe seasons are done, and reasons are none\nPeople dyin' bullets flyin' cause they squeezin' for fun\nIt's all of a nightmare, that's right there\nThey hopin' that somebody in the hood just might care\nWith all this protestin' and rallyin', death toll tallyin'\nFoul smells around them, pails in the alley an'\nCorner filled with teddy bears, cause they killed a child again\nThey sing about murder, so it ain't a song it's hollerin'\nGet off the choir with your soft attire\nNiggas out here don't give a fuck, cause they Lost Desire\n x2\n\nYeah\nMy city's full of, heartbreakers and stargazers\nWho puff garsh Vegas\nSo they \"Gone With The Wind\", like Clark Gable\nBreathin' like Darth Vader, believin' in dark angel\nYeah, we got flags, but they not star-spangled\nWe not patriotic, the heroes are not them\nGhetto grills like rims, you stop, they still spin\nTall tales at the bar, witnessed after dark\nAnd we still stop in and chicken and (?) Timbs\nAnd listen to Rakim\nWith the way that y'all been\nFor realla, I hadn't been schemin' to ply in\nYou fear us? Fear is self, personified\nPayin' homage to homicide\nPrayin' to the dollar sign\nIt's Idle/Idol Worship, the rebel forces\nBodies lie at the foundation of the fortress\nThis is war, we expect some losses\nAnd we comin' for the heads of the bosses\n x2\n\nYo\nWe on some casualties of war shit\nWhat you stand for, kid?\nWe in the city where they definitely lost it\nYou open your eye-lids and get capped in the ribs\nYour funeral they have your 12th grade portrait\nPretty corpse in casket, bell-shaped orchids\nSaid he 19 and left a self-made fortune\nAnd left three orphans\nNow he in a box with the same chain and watch\nThat never came off him\nIt's a shame what it cost him\nWhere he come from it ain't nothin'\nIt's a everyday thing, that's a problem\nIt's chambers revolvin'\nBustin' like Russian roulette\nWith a full set, they change what the odds is\nFlames in the mosque, and people held hostage\nEveryday I struggle, try to get up out the mosh-pit\nHomicide for profit, tell me how we not sick?\nThis shit is out of control, they can't stop it\n x1\nIt's the love...

dove\nInto the deep cosmos\nThe impact pushed back, twenty five rows\nBut before the raw live shows, come on I'se a little snot-nosed\nRockin' Gazelle, goggles and Izod clothes\nLearnin' the ropes of ghetto survival\nPeepin' out the situation I had to slide through\nHad to watch my back my front plus my sides too\nBut when it came to gettin' mine I ain't tryin', to argue\nSometimes I wouldn'ta

tour for you\nFrom the start, thought was down by law for you\nI used to hit up every corner store wall for you\nWe ripped shit, and kept it hardcore for you\nI remember late nights, steady rockin' the mic\nHip-hop, you the love of my life\nTell the people like that y'all, that y'all\nAnd it sounds so nice\nHip-hop, you the love of my life\nWe 'bout to take it to the top\nTo the top, to the top,

no protection, told her on resurrection\nCaught in the Hype Williams, and lost her direction\nGettin' ate in sections where I wouldn't eat her\nAn under the counter love, so silently I treat her\nHer daddy'll beat her, eyes all Puffed\nIn the mix on tape, niggas had her in the buff\nWhen we touch, it was more than just a fuck\nThe Police, in her I found peace, like who?\nLike Malcolm in the East, seen her on the streets of New York, trickin' off\nTried to make a hit with her but my dick went soft\nMovin' weight, losin' weight, not picky with who she choose to date\nTo confuse the hate, with her struggle I relate\nClose to thirty, most of the niggas she know is dirty\nHavin' more babies than Lauryn, she started showin' early\nAs of late I realized, that this is her fate\nOr destiny that brings the best of me it's like God is testin' me\nIn retrospect I see she brought life and death to me\nPeace to us collectively, live and direct when we perform\nIt's just coffee shop chicks and white dudes\nOver her I got into it with that nigga Ice Cube\nNow the fight moved to in life, makin' the right moves\nBesides God and family, you my life's jewel\nLike that y'all, and it sounds so

to go to the top, y'all\nHip-hop hu, to the top hu\nHip-hop check it out\nIt's like that y'all, and it sounds so nice\nHip-hop, you the love of my life\nWe 'bout to go to the to the to the\nTo the to the to the to the\nTo the to the to the to the\nTo the to the to the to the check it out\nThe anticipation arose as time froze\nI stared off the stage with my eyes closed and dove\nInto the deep cosmos\nThe impact pushed back, twenty five rows\nBut before the raw live shows, come on I'se a little snot-nosed\nRockin' Gazelle, goggles and Izod clothes\nLearnin' the ropes of ghetto survival\nPeepin' out the situation I had to slide through\nHad to watch my back my front plus my sides too\nBut when it came to gettin' mine I ain't tryin', to argue\nSometimes I wouldn'ta made it if it wasn't for you\nHip-hop, you the love of my life and that's true\nWhen I was handlin' the shit I had to do\nIt was all for you, from the door for you\nSpeak through you, gettin' paper on tour for you\nFrom the start, thought was down by law for you\nI used to hit up every corner store wall for you\nWe ripped shit, and kept it hardcore for you\nI remember late nights, steady rockin' the mic\nHip-hop, you the love of my life\nTell the people like that y'all, that y'all\nAnd it sounds so nice\nHip-hop, you the love of my life\nWe 'bout to take it to the top\nTo the top, to the top, to the top, to the top\nTo the top, to the top, to the top, check it out\nIt's like that y'all, and it sounds so nice\nHip-hop, you the love of my life\nWe 'bout to go to the to the to the\nTo the to the to the to the\nTo the to the to the to the\nTo the to the to the to the check it out\nYo, yo I was speakin', to my guy 'Riq and\nHow she was desperately seekin' to organize in a confusion\nUsin', no protection, told her on resurrection\nCaught in the Hype Williams, and lost her direction\nGettin' ate in sections where I wouldn't eat her\nAn under the counter love, so silently I treat her\nHer daddy'll beat her, eyes all Puffed\nIn the mix on tape, niggas had her in the buff\nWhen we touch, it was more than just a fuck\nThe Police, in her I found peace, like who?\nLike Malcolm in the East, seen her on the streets of New York, trickin' off\nTried to make a hit with her but my dick went soft\nMovin' weight, losin' weight, not picky with who she choose to date\nTo confuse the hate, with her struggle I relate\nClose to thirty, most of the niggas she know is dirty\nHavin' more babies than Lauryn, she started showin' early\nAs of late I realized, that this is her fate\nOr destiny that brings the best of me it's like God is testin' me\nIn retrospect I see she brought life and death to me\nPeace to us collectively, live and direct when we perform\nIt's just coffee shop chicks and white dudes\nOver her I got into it with that nigga Ice Cube\nNow the fight moved to in life, makin' the right moves\nBesides God and family, you my life's jewel\nLike that y'all, and it sounds so

all for the money, Lord\nIt's what it seems..\nWell, in the world of night terrors it's\nHard to dream, they hollerin' cash rules everything\nJust call it cream, cause when it rises to the top\nYou get the finer things\nOceanfronts, rolling blunts with model chicks\nAnd saying grace over lobster and steak\nLike please forgive us for riding Benzes with camera plates\nToo busy looking backwards for jackers to pump my brakes\nFor help signs to symbolize the lives that hunger takes\nAddicted to the green, if I don't ball I'll get the shakes\nI'd give it all for peace of mind, for Heaven's sake\nMy heart's so heavy that the ropes that hold my casket breaks\nCause everything that wasn't for me I had to chase\nI had to take, I had to take\n\nThey told me that the ends\nWon't justify the means\nThey told me at the end\nDon't justify the dreams\nThat I've had since a child\nMaybe I'll throw in the towel\nMake my (make my)\nMake my (make my)\nDeparture from the world\n\nTryin' to control the fits of panic\nUnwritten and unraveled, it's the dead man's pedantic\nWhatever, see it's really just a matter of semantics\nWhen everybody's fresh out of collateral to damage\nAnd my splaying got me praying like a mantis\nI begin to vanish\nFeel the pull of the blank canvas\nI'm contemplating that special dedication\nTo whoever it concern, my letter of resignation\nFading back to black, my dark coronation\nThe heat of the day, the long robe of muerte\nThat soul is in the atmosphere like airplay\nIf there's a Heaven I can't find a stairway\n\nThey told me that the ends\nWon't justify the means\nThey told me at the end\nDon't justify the dreams\nThat I've had since a child\nMaybe I'll throw in the towel\nMake my (make my)\nMake my (make my)\nDeparture from the world",

it rises to the top\nYou get the finer things\nOceanfronts, rolling blunts with model chicks\nAnd saying grace over lobster and steak\nLike please forgive us for riding Benzes with camera plates\nToo busy looking backwards for jackers to pump my brakes\nFor help signs to symbolize the lives that hunger takes\nAddicted to the green, if I don't ball I'll get the shakes\nI'd give it all for peace of mind, for Heaven's sake\nMy heart's so heavy that the ropes that hold my casket breaks\nCause everything that wasn't for me I had to chase\nI had to take, I had to take\n\nThey told me that the ends\nWon't justify the means\nThey told me at the end\nDon't justify the dreams\nThat I've had since a child\nMaybe I'll throw in the towel\nMake my (make my)\nMake my (make my)\nDeparture from the world\n\nTryin' to control the fits of panic\nUnwritten and unraveled, it's the dead man's pedantic\nWhatever, see it's really just a matter of semantics\nWhen everybody's fresh out of collateral to damage\nAnd my splaying got me praying like a mantis\nI begin to vanish\nFeel the pull of the blank canvas\nI'm contemplating that special dedication\nTo whoever it concern, my letter of resignation\nFading back to black, my dark coronation\nThe heat of the day, the long robe of muerte\nThat soul is in the atmosphere like airplay\nIf there's a Heaven I can't find a stairway\n\nThey told me that the ends\nWon't justify the means\nThey told me at the end\nDon't justify the dreams\nThat I've had since a child\nMaybe I'll throw in the towel\nMake my (make my)\nMake my (make

Rick the Ruler I'm cooler than a ice brick\nGot soul like those afro picks, with the black fist\nAnd leave a crowd drippin like John the Baptist, it's\nThe cause of that \"Oh shit!\"\nThe skits I kick, flows like catfish\nAnd got many emcees on the blacklist\nI'm sharp as a cactus plus, quick to bust gymnastic tactics\nUs, Roots is really true to that rap shit\nNow holla to the scholarly, street skats that follow me\nBack to the Soul Shack with packs of rap colonies\nMax that, Foreign Objects is mad abstract, make Shadrach\nOffender wanna go like Meshach, Black\nThought the nappy cat a bookworm shoot styles like sperm\nCool as Malcolm Little with conch a la perm burn\nThe herb sticks like wicks, and flips when I slaps the hand\nOf my mellow my man, Malik B\n\nHere I goes, negroes best to know the flower\nThe pro-fessional, best in those skills that kills so uhh..\nWHOA, slow down before you go down (sissy)\nTrixie this is Agatha Christie - you're slain and know now\nNext contender, Malik's the axe offender\nCritique me so uniquely with mystique that's so deep within the\nMicrophones I grip, psych with poems so's I slits throats\nPut him in a quote, when he croaks\nThey sayin -- isn't it, is it the negro that did it?\nCause wreck with the tech, make you jump and say 'ribbit'\nI exhibit many forms, prohibit the corny forms\n(And we're in, your neighborhood) on the norms\nCapture, was to, whack ya\nManu-facture, you can even ask Anita about the, rap-ture\nI figured, perhaps ya, a say it SLAM\nFor my mellow my man\n\nThe way we do it like

Get\nBeat Down Turn that heat down, I'm crazy cool\nDeeper than the pool that Wilt the Stilt Damn near drowned in\nClowns bounce to sound when Thoughts pound and brown's\nMy complexion section Southern\nMy brother-in is Jex, I\nSweats no sex, cause this kid gets\nGrits n shit, it's flex to drains that was crazed\nWhen your heart spit up, dip dup damn\nYo I lost it but\nBack is the Black Boogey Man\nManic mad musician, maker of noise\nThat's jocked, by your homeboys\nI rocks my flocks of sheep, it's the slickest shepherd around\nI was lost but was found, now I gets down\nFrom Philly to the Apple I, stop and holla tunes and then hit\nUp-town, Diggin Planets when they get Earthbound\nI kick the groovy tunes for you and yours, when I pass the can\nTo my mellow my man, Malik B\n\nWHOAHHHHH, shucks, my nuc snuff ducks (uh-huh)\nAbruptly I erupt, to destruct, deducts\nIn wax I like to smack em, stroke em as I cap em\nChange my name to Saran or Reynolds then I Wrap em\nNegroes know we be furrow to my borough\nCause my ass is so thorough, like Levert Gerald\nToo strong to be sterile\nSo I impregnates the greats (say what?)\nBust the Pacino's, I won't trust them\nEven though I lust them shapes -- females for retail prices\nTwice this nice with sugar and spices\nI won't smirk, cause my name's not Urkel\nThe voice with the multiple choice, she does a circle\nYou wanna turn and page your eyes, and try to plagerize\nBut I degrade ya, slaughtered ya and slayed ya\nMicrophones I grip equipped to flip the hypocrites\nAnd nit-wits, with tidbit skits,

Rick the Ruler I'm cooler than a ice brick\nGot soul like those afro picks, with the black fist\nAnd leave a crowd drippin like John the Baptist, it's\nThe cause of that \"Oh shit!\"\nThe skits I kick, flows like catfish\nAnd got many emcees on the blacklist\nI'm sharp as a cactus plus, quick to bust gymnastic tactics\nUs, Roots is really true to that rap shit\nNow holla to the scholarly, street skats that follow me\nBack to the Soul Shack with packs of rap colonies\nMax that, Foreign Objects is mad abstract, make Shadrach\nOffender wanna go like Meshach, Black\nThought the nappy cat a bookworm shoot styles like sperm\nCool as Malcolm Little with conch a la perm burn\nThe herb sticks like wicks, and flips when I slaps the hand\nOf my mellow my man, Malik B\n\nHere I goes, negroes best to know the flower\nThe pro-fessional, best in those skills that kills so uhh..\nWHOA, slow down before you go down (sissy)\nTrixie this is Agatha Christie - you're slain and know now\nNext contender, Malik's the axe offender\nCritique me so uniquely with mystique that's so deep within the\nMicrophones I grip, psych with poems so's I slits throats\nPut him in a quote, when he croaks\nThey sayin -- isn't it, is it the negro that did it?\nCause wreck with the tech, make you jump and say 'ribbit'\nI exhibit many forms, prohibit the corny forms\n(And we're in, your neighborhood) on the norms\nCapture, was to, whack ya\nManu-facture, you can even ask Anita about the, rap-ture\nI figured, perhaps ya, a say it SLAM\nFor my mellow my man\n\nThe way we do it like this\nThat, for my mellow my man\nIt's like that for my mellow my man\nNo no we do it like that\nThis, for my mellow my man\nIt's like this for my mellow my man\nNo no we do it like this\nThat, for my mellow my man\nIt's like that for my mellow my man\nNo no we do it like that\nThis, for my mellow my man\nIt's like this for my mellow my man\n\nYo, I got spunk, plus funk And Jump Like Punks, to Get\nBeat Down Turn that heat down, I'm crazy cool\nDeeper than the pool that Wilt the Stilt Damn near drowned in\nClowns bounce to sound when Thoughts pound and brown's\nMy complexion section Southern\nMy brother-in is Jex, I\nSweats no sex, cause this kid gets\nGrits n shit, it's flex to drains that was crazed\nWhen your heart spit up, dip dup damn\nYo I lost it but\nBack is the Black Boogey Man\nManic mad musician, maker of noise\nThat's jocked, by your homeboys\nI rocks my flocks of sheep, it's the slickest shepherd around\nI was lost but was found, now I gets down\nFrom Philly to the Apple I, stop and holla tunes and then hit\nUp-town, Diggin Planets when they get Earthbound\nI kick the groovy tunes for you and yours, when I pass the can\nTo my mellow my man, Malik B\n\nWHOAHHHHH, shucks, my nuc snuff ducks (uh-huh)\nAbruptly I erupt, to destruct, deducts\nIn wax I like to smack em, stroke em as I cap em\nChange my name to Saran or Reynolds then I Wrap em\nNegroes know we be furrow to my borough\nCause my ass is so thorough, like Levert Gerald\nToo strong to be sterile\nSo I impregnates the greats (say what?)\nBust the Pacino's, I won't trust them\nEven though I lust them shapes -- females for retail prices\nTwice this nice with sugar and spices\nI won't smirk, cause my name's not Urkel\nThe voice with the multiple choice, she does a circle\nYou wanna turn and page your eyes, and try to plagerize\nBut I degrade ya, slaughtered ya and slayed ya\nMicrophones I grip equipped to flip the hypocrites\nAnd nit-wits, with tidbit skits, that ain't *shhh*\nIt was a curse, but I divide it in half\nGets the airplay, no fair play, you're feelin the wrath\nOf Malik, ayo get tragic, negroes that get dramatic\nBecause I have the habit to smoke rabbits like a addict\nSo if you can not rap I will just slap YOU\nIf you wants to pick up on your nose be shows the chrome\nAnd then we cap, YOU\nIt's too bad, dem cyan't understand de true

night\nThe only thing I ever loved in my life was the mic\nTrust me, it's something 'bout the way I touch her\nThe way that I hold her, the way I clutch her\nShe move a lot but that ain't shit to me\nI need that bitch and that bitch needs me\nShe want to know if we can be together\nEven if it ain't gonna be forever\nBut it can only be for one night\nThe only thing I ever loved in my life was the mic"}}, {"title": "My Shot (Rise Up Remix)", "album": "The Hamilton Mixtape", "year": "2016-11-04", "lyrics": "The Hamilton Mixtape\nWoah, woah, woah, woah\nWoah, woah, woah\n\nAyo, mugshot, gun shot, dope shot, jump shot\nTake your pick\u2014but you only get one shot\nAdvice from a schoolteacher to a young tot\nApplyin' a sticker to his Spiderman lunchbox\nWhen even role models tell us we're born to be felons\nWe're never gettin' into Harvard or Carnegie Mellon\nAnd we gon' end up either robbin' somebody or killin'\nIt's not fair that's all they can tell us\nThat's why I hustle hella hard, never celebrate a holiday\nThat'll be the day I coulda finally hit the lottery\nI refuse to ever lose or throw my shot away\nOr chalk it up as just another one that got away\nSo I'm unapologetic, I'm on my calesthenics\nIf I have given it all I got I cannot regret it\nMy point of destination's different from where I was headed\n'Cause I'ma shoot for the stars to get it\nOne shot\n\nI said I'm not throwin' away my shot\nI said I'm not throwin' away my shot\nYo I'm just like my country\nI'm young, scrappy, and hungry\nAnd I'm not throwin' away my shot\nI said I'm not throwin' away my shot\nNo I'm not throwin' away my shot\nYo I'm just like my country\nI'm young, scrappy and hungry\nAnd I'm not throwin' away my shot\n\nWhen opportunity knock, you don't send anyone to get it\nAnswer the door, welcome it, let it in, or regret it\nThey said if you can't beat 'em you join 'em\nI say, \"Forget it\"\n'Cause once you join 'em you're buildin' a ceilin' the way you're headed\nBe American, express how you feel and take the credit\nDon't settle for 87, go premium unleaded and\nTake off, shake all the hate off, it's over\nIt's they loss, the payoff's their weight off your shoulders\nMust admit, I'm feelin', um, kinda, um\nLighter as a writer with this fire and desire to go higher\nThan a stealth fighter pilot with my eye on every prize\nI surprise you guys, I'm a prize fighter\nMy nine to five describe your scribe, survive minor\nSetbacks and take steps back from pied pipers\nBe leaders, believers in yourself and mean it\nI mean you only get one shot, take it or leave it\n\nI said I'm not throwin' away my shot\nI said I'm not throwin' away my shot\nYo I'm just like my country\nI'm young, scrappy and hungry\nAnd I'm not throwin' away my shot\nI said I'm not throwin' away my shot\nNo I'm not throwin' away my shot\nYo I'm just like my country\nI'm young, scrappy and hungry\nAnd I'm not throwin' away my shot\n\nRise up\nIf you livin' on your knees, you rise up\nTell your brother that he's gotta rise up\nTell your sister that she's gotta rise up\nWhen are folks like me and you gonna rise up?\nEvery city, every hood, we need to rise up\nAll my soldiers, what's good? We need to wise up\nWe ain't got no other choice, we need to wise up\nRise up!\n\nThroughout my travels and journeys through life I've been searchin'\nAnd been learnin' to be the type of person\nTo display how determined I get when I'm certain\nInside I feel that fire that's burnin'\nLike a knife that is turnin', I fight while I'm hurtin'\nSometimes they're right 'cause life is a burden\nLike the pain from a bite that'll worsen\nTryna stifle the light that'll shine on me first and\nBefore I ride in a hearse and\nMy breathing stops and\nYou'll never take my one shot I got 'fore I lie in the earth\nAnd now I come again holdin' that Hamilton Hercules Mulligan\nReadin' in Vanity Fair or the Huffington\nDone with the sufferin', we in the guts again, family rushin' in\nWonder where Busta been\nFeelin' the hunger and feedin' the lust to win\nSee I've been patiently waitin' for this moment\nTo rise up again, that's the way I was molded\nAnd as the last one standin' as the rest of them foldin'\nGive me my one chance to grab the torch and properly hold it\n\nI said I'm not throwin' away my shot\nI said I'm not throwin' away my shot\nAyy, yo I'm just like my country\nI'm young, scrappy and hungry\nAnd I'm not throwin' away my shot\nI said I'm not throwin' away my shot\nNo I'm not throwin' away my shot\nYo I'm just like my country\nI'm young, scrappy and hungry\nAnd I'm not throwin' away my shot\nI said I'm not throwin' away my shot\nI said I'm not throwin' away my shot\nAyy, yo I'm just like my country\nI'm young, scrappy and hungry\nAnd I'm not throwin' away my shot\nI said I'm not throwin' away my shot\nNo I'm not throwin' away my shot\nAyy yo I'm just like my country\nI'm young, scrappy and hungry\nAnd I'm not throwin' away my shot\nIt's time to take a shot\n\nWoah, woah, woah, woah\nWoah, woah, woah, woah", "image": "https://images.genius.com/3b8300d20734480638c9e91996c9bcbd.1000x1000x1.jpg", "artist": "The Roots", "raw": {"annotation_count": 32,

pick\u2014but you only get one shot\nAdvice from a schoolteacher to a young tot\nApplyin' a sticker to his Spiderman lunchbox\nWhen even role models tell us we're born to be felons\nWe're never gettin' into Harvard or Carnegie Mellon\nAnd we gon' end up either robbin' somebody or killin'\nIt's not fair that's all they can tell us\nThat's why I hustle hella hard, never celebrate a holiday\nThat'll be the day I coulda finally hit the lottery\nI refuse to ever lose or throw my shot away\nOr chalk it up as just another one that got away\nSo I'm unapologetic, I'm on my calesthenics\nIf I have given it all I got I cannot regret it\nMy point of destination's different from where I was headed\n'Cause I'ma shoot for the stars to get it\nOne shot\n\nI said I'm not throwin' away my shot\nI said I'm not throwin' away my shot\nYo I'm just like my country\nI'm young, scrappy, and hungry\nAnd I'm not throwin' away my shot\nI said I'm not throwin' away my shot\nNo I'm not throwin' away my shot\nYo I'm just like my country\nI'm young, scrappy and hungry\nAnd I'm not throwin' away my shot\n\nWhen opportunity knock, you don't send anyone to get it\nAnswer the door, welcome it, let it in, or regret it\nThey said if you can't beat 'em you join 'em\nI say, \"Forget it\"\n'Cause once you join 'em you're buildin' a ceilin' the way you're headed\nBe American, express how you feel and take the credit\nDon't settle for 87, go premium unleaded and\nTake off, shake all the hate off, it's over\nIt's they loss, the payoff's their weight off your shoulders\nMust admit, I'm feelin', um, kinda, um\nLighter as a writer with this fire and desire to go higher\nThan a stealth fighter pilot with my eye on every prize\nI surprise you guys, I'm a prize fighter\nMy nine to five describe your scribe, survive minor\nSetbacks and take steps back from pied pipers\nBe leaders, believers in yourself and mean it\nI mean you only get one shot, take it or leave it\n\nI said I'm not throwin' away my shot\nI said I'm not throwin' away my shot\nYo I'm just like my country\nI'm young, scrappy and hungry\nAnd I'm not throwin' away my shot\nI said I'm not throwin' away my shot\nNo I'm not throwin' away my shot\nYo I'm just like my country\nI'm young, scrappy and hungry\nAnd I'm not throwin' away my shot\n\nRise up\nIf you livin' on your knees, you rise up\nTell your brother that he's gotta rise up\nTell your sister that she's gotta rise up\nWhen are folks like me and you gonna rise up?\nEvery city, every hood, we need to rise up\nAll my soldiers, what's good? We need to wise up\nWe ain't got no other choice, we need to wise up\nRise up!\n\nThroughout my travels and journeys through life I've been searchin'\nAnd been learnin' to be the type of person\nTo display how determined I get when I'm certain\nInside I feel that fire that's burnin'\nLike a knife that is turnin', I fight while I'm hurtin'\nSometimes they're right 'cause life is a burden\nLike the pain from a bite that'll worsen\nTryna stifle the light that'll shine on me first and\nBefore I ride in a hearse and\nMy breathing stops and\nYou'll never take my one shot I got 'fore I lie in the earth\nAnd now I come again holdin' that Hamilton Hercules Mulligan\nReadin' in Vanity Fair or the Huffington\nDone with the sufferin', we in the guts again, family rushin' in\nWonder where Busta been\nFeelin' the hunger and feedin' the lust to win\nSee I've been patiently waitin' for this moment\nTo rise up again, that's the way I was molded\nAnd as the last one standin' as the rest of them foldin'\nGive me my one chance to grab the torch and properly hold it\n\nI said I'm not throwin' away my shot\nI said I'm not throwin' away my shot\nAyy, yo I'm just like my country\nI'm young, scrappy and hungry\nAnd I'm not throwin' away my shot\nI said I'm not throwin' away my shot\nNo I'm not throwin' away my shot\nYo I'm just like my country\nI'm young, scrappy and hungry\nAnd I'm not throwin' away my shot\nI said I'm not throwin' away my shot\nI said I'm not throwin' away my shot\nAyy, yo I'm just like my country\nI'm young, scrappy and hungry\nAnd I'm not throwin' away my shot\nI said I'm not throwin' away my shot\nNo I'm not throwin' away my shot\nAyy yo I'm just like my country\nI'm young, scrappy and hungry\nAnd I'm not throwin' away my shot\nIt's time to take a shot\n\nWoah, woah, woah, woah\nWoah, woah, woah, woah"}}, {"title": "Never", "album": "\u2026And Then You Shoot Your Cousin", "year": "2014-05-19", "lyrics": "Street dreams, close your eyes\nSay

says never\nI look down... all I see is never\nAnd all I know is all I know...\n\n\nI was born faceless in an oasis\nFolks disappear here and leave no traces\nNo family ties nigga no laces\nLess than a full deck nigga no aces\nWaitin' on Superman losing all patience\nGettin' wasted on an everyday basis\nI'm stuck here can't take a vacation\nSo fuck it, this shit is damnation\nThis is reality mane\nAin't no surprise I've been bangin' without any mane\nWhat is this gotta be brave\nWhen into the night I'm going to go quietly mane\nLife is a bitch and then you live\nUntil one day by death you're found\nI tried to keep both of my feet on the ground\nBut I know my head is surrounded by clouds\nSpirallin' down, destined to drown\nForever is just a collection of nows\nOff on my own, nowhere is my home\nApproaching infinity's fork in the road\nWhen I was young something I often was told\nIt's not a bargain if it costs you your soul\nCosts you your pride, caution aside\nI'm gone with the wind and along for the ride\nWish I could rest and open my eyes\nBut time ain't finna fly down from the sky\nA place where the lonely love\nNot another soul's there, only us\n\nStreet dreams, close your eyes\nSay goodbye to my memory\nStreet dreams, this is the moment\nThe moment that feels like forever\nThis is the end to where I began\nAnd it feels like forever\nThey say time flies\nDown from the sky and says never\nI look down... all I see is never\nAnd all I know is all I know...\n\nI woke with a tear drop\nAll I know is what I know\nI woke with a tear drop\nAll I know is what I

all I know is all I know...\n\n\nI was born faceless in an oasis\nFolks disappear here and leave no traces\nNo family ties nigga no laces\nLess than a full deck nigga no aces\nWaitin' on Superman losing all patience\nGettin' wasted on an everyday basis\nI'm stuck here can't take a vacation\nSo fuck it, this shit is damnation\nThis is reality mane\nAin't no surprise I've been bangin' without any mane\nWhat is this gotta be brave\nWhen into the night I'm going to go quietly mane\nLife is a bitch and then you live\nUntil one day by death you're found\nI tried to keep both of my feet on the ground\nBut I know my head is surrounded by clouds\nSpirallin' down, destined to drown\nForever is just a collection of nows\nOff on my own, nowhere is my home\nApproaching infinity's fork in the road\nWhen I was young something I often was told\nIt's not a bargain if it costs you your soul\nCosts you your pride, caution aside\nI'm gone with the wind and along for the ride\nWish I could rest and open my eyes\nBut time ain't finna fly down from the sky\nA place where the lonely love\nNot another soul's there, only us\n\nStreet dreams, close your eyes\nSay goodbye to my memory\nStreet dreams, this is the moment\nThe moment that feels like forever\nThis is the end to where I began\nAnd it feels like forever\nThey say time flies\nDown from the sky and says never\nI look down... all I see is never\nAnd all I know is all I know...\n\nI woke with a tear drop\nAll I know is what I know\nI woke with a tear drop\nAll I know is what I know\nIt's all I know\nAll I know.."}}, {"title": "No

my sentences and thoughts like apostrophes\nYou represent hypocrisy, it ain't no stopping me\nUntil I fulfill the term of my prophecy\nMy attitude is scarred by this inner-city urban\nIller dolo stress on my brain just like a turban\nWho get grazed by the bullet? Triggers, who's quick to pull it?\nThe anti-bullshitter, Islamic extortioner\nYou're the forfeiter unfortunately\nNiggas who wanna gyp me; I cause humidity so come and get me\nI'm simply, the cat to lay back, I chill and watch you\nThe silent ninja, intends to injure, now I got you\nSanity was lost so now I'm found insane\nI'm seeking streets to jeeps; hours, days, to weeks\nI even speak to geeks, I hold my fortune, it's sweet\nI'm discreet in the streets, but that's just the way I play though\nI lay low, but over your head just like a halo\nHell's angel, these thoughts you cannot untangle\nWhen I drop jewels, niggas, they wear them like a bangle\nCheck it out, one time for your mind like that\n\nIf you seen it or heard it, maybe probably I did it\nMaybe or maybe not, I admit what I committed\nExhibit the truth, because I'm living proof why\nI had no disguise, no verdicts no alibis\n\nDig it, look into my window tell me what you see\nLieutenant university of philosophy\nWhile you not possibly escaping what I'm meditating\nMy shackle of thought tackle you while I'm educating\nYour dome's resonating, from inhalation of darkness\nAs I spark the smart shit for which you\u2019re waiting\nSituatin' me at the top of the pile\nWild Delaware file, Pennsylvanian, sub-terranean style\nStep up into my crevice and taste, the medicine of the champagne\nKing like Evelyn leaving you leveled and sabotaged\nIt's all camouflage like the devil and guns\nAnd coke peddling, Olympic medaling flashback\nThat of a war veteran blast at\nThe programmer bringing lashes 'cross your back\nOn some accuracy of a brainwashed Bosnian troop\nThat swooped down through your roof without sound\nOn a lyrical Nat Turner mission, reacting off of intuition\nContinuously alert, no intermission\nIf your ears hurt, you shouldn't listen\nThat means you artificial and my style'll poison your brain tissue\nGettin' maimed and crippled once the gamma rays hit you\nMy grains habitual and I should never go against\nThe ritual I've been mastering ever since\nI was among the flavored youth, remain sharper than a saber tooth\nMy deliverance is self-evident\nVital, lyrical science (now)\n\n\nWho knows what you snorted? Or who support what you recording?\nBut don't get it distorted, in this orbit you're aborting\nThis authentic sort of shit's imported, exported\nStyles, they get sported my paragraphs aortic\nBehold, the illest medley lock you in the choke hold\nIlladel epilogue, top league plus plush in Vogue\nSlice tongues from your area code\nStudent of life, that's on the rugged exterior mode\nBlind a devil with the bold black and gold shine\nI walk the thin line and hold mine, let the people respond\nIt's mind detect mind, swine decline let the power refine\nBuild like it's 1999\nIn this day and time, the reptilian rooms, the sextillion tons\nYour Armageddon gwan come from the sun\nUntouchable cuts that's unclutchable for some\nTo overstand, so y'all sit back and wonder damn\nI like to take this time to show you who I am\nOriginal man, Black Thought, a.k.a. lieutenant\nMalik B'll be the M-illitant\nKnown to vanish in the atmosphere\nWe up there like the stratus", "image":

committed\nExhibit the truth, because I'm living proof why\nI had no disguise trying to vocalize\n\nDig it, look into my window, tell me what you see\nThe M-illitant school of philosophy\nWhen niggas

Thought, is in the house\nAnd uhh, Malik B, is in the house\nWe're groovin out, yes in the house\n*discordant talk*\n...\nJust get on the mic with your master plan\nVerse One: Malik B\nI can make you dance, I can make you shout\nThe scripts in the scroll turned the whole party out\nInject my lyrics in a sec with dialect\nWhy accept, because it's from the highest eye and depth\nRap extrordinaire share me never ever\nSee through because I be true, Malik's together\nIntox your cells till your brain vein swells\nNiggas'll claim terror when their never parellel\nOnce I have a hunch that there's MC's that front\nI just crunched a whole bunch, in one big munch\nI always stand firm, under any term\nMy actions never squirm cuz my tracks is perm\nI have a tendency to defend this MC\nMy residency is simply in sensei\nI makes it vivid, on different continents of earth I pivot\nIt seems extreme and exquisite but ask it is it\nMy style is like a cat from a seventies flick\nTalkin jive as he strut with his afro pick\nOr a predator, just before he stalks his pray\nWhen I talk this way, I do dismay\nSee you're puzzled, now how I think you're trying to juggle\nMy mind is like a nine M double, now there's trouble\nThe Roots bring you styles and all types of creed\nI sign off but I shall proceed\nChorus:\nI shall, proceed, and continue, to rock the mic (4X)\nVerse Two: Black Thought\nYo, we could get fly, we could get fly\nWe could get fly that's the anthem of my\nCrew not to glorify but it's sorta high\nTroubles of the world bring tears to my eye wonder why\nMy man, can't vaccinate, y'all know the fate\nSimilar to the way I'm a disease on tape\nTo escape Metropolis is such a violent state\nI spill words over pages, styles over phrases\nFrom the world's different stages for crowds of different ages\nThough not a nova, you witness like Jehovah\nNow niggas beg for lyrical plague to pass them over\nRigh right niggas is like stick up kids\nDoin bids you got caught, enter the Black Thought\nI interface with bass when I communicate\nCrowds I elevate, to another mindstate of\nRap thinking, see musically the Black thinking rhythm\nTherefore, I give em what I'm giving, therefore\nI give em what I'm giving that's the hardcore\nThe Roots'll keep it real for sure, and I shall proceed\nChorus\nRockin on the microphone I do this well (repeats)\n*crowd cheers*\nThe Roots, The Roots!"}}, {"title": "Now or Never", "album": "How I Got Over", "year": "2010-06-22", "lyrics": "Everything's changing around me\nAnd I want to change too\nIt's one thing I know\nIt ain't cool being no fool\nI feel different today\nI don't know what else to say\nBut I'mma get my shit together\nIt's now or never\n\nI'm sick, sick of waiting in vain, tired of playing the game\nThinking of making a change, finally breaking the chains\nEvery phase, every happening, craze\nWhen it's said and done, my head is right back in a haze\nI'm ready for the next chapter and page to start acting my age\nAnd part ways with Black Thought from back in the days\nI'm stargazing from the back of the stage\nQuestioning if who y'all praise is worthy of praise\nWhat's the phrase \"bygones is bygones?\"\nNiggas who used to be the underdogs is icons\nPeople say the light shines once in a lifetime\nIs this midlife kind a crisis a little bit like mine\nI'm thinking not now, but right now\nI need some kinda sign that the future is bright now\nI fuck around, do the right thing like Spike now\nThe quick and the dead, which one is my lookalike now?\nI'm moving ahead\n\nEverything's changing around me\nAnd I want to change too\nIt's one thing I know\nIt ain't cool being no fool\nI feel different today\nI don't know what else to say\nBut I'mma get my shit together\nIt's now or never\n\nOpportunities lost because I blew them\nOn the sunniest days of my life, I cry through them\nMom's out the picture and Pops, I barely knew him\nAnd I would pray to God but I'm tired of lying to him\nTired of trying to run from the things inside of us\nGot a lot of fam, and a lot of admirers\nWho tell me that I should aspire to be changed\nBut when I think of changing, it's like why even try this shit?\nMy mind hazy and my thoughts, they get distorted\nI know my good and bad deeds both get recorded\nYou do right so your soul can last\nBut my role is cast before I even audition for it\nSo I don't really see an end to my vice\nIt's just false reformation, no end of my strife\nFeel the evil overpowering, you can go ahead throw the towel in\nCause nigga, that's the end of the fight\nWhen you can only see the tunnel at the end of the light\nLights out, party over, it's the end of your life\nAnd I'm out\n\nEverything's changing around me\nAnd I want to change too\nIt's one thing I know\nIt ain't cool being no fool\nI feel different today\nI don't know what else to say\nBut I'mma get my shit together\nIt's now or never\n\nWhen I look into the mirror and see my own image\nIt feels like there's something else far in the distance\nSomething I wanna see, but something that's resistant\nAnd everyday the haunting is growing more persistent\nI never noticed it before, but now I can't miss it\nAnd the constant pounding is driving me ballistic\nI ran from it for years, but it's still next to me\nAnd it's growing stronger, taking even less of me\nI can't fight it now, I know it's just destiny\nAnd I just wonder what's gonna happen when it catches me\nWill it leave me face down in the Chesapeake?\nOr will it just start bringing out the best in me?\nBut is the best in me really just the worst in me\nAnd if so, yesterday could be my anniversary\nIn sinner's court, sip port and have church with me\nI'm trying to get rid of these ghosts that's cursing me\nI'm feeling change is an absolute certainty\nCause what's going on is a state of emergency", "image": "https://images.genius.com/b05244cd035a0258a064922787c50099.500x500x1.jpg", "artist": "The Roots", "raw": {"annotation_count": 28,

know\nIt ain't cool being no fool\nI feel different today\nI don't know what else to say\nBut I'mma get my shit together\nIt's now or never\n\nI'm sick, sick of waiting in vain, tired of playing the game\nThinking of making a change, finally breaking the chains\nEvery phase, every happening, craze\nWhen it's said and done, my head is right back in a haze\nI'm ready for the next chapter and page to start acting my age\nAnd part ways with Black Thought from back in the days\nI'm stargazing from the back of the stage\nQuestioning if who y'all praise is worthy of praise\nWhat's the phrase \"bygones is bygones?\"\nNiggas who used to be the underdogs is icons\nPeople say the light shines once in a lifetime\nIs this midlife kind a crisis a little bit like mine\nI'm thinking not now, but right now\nI need some kinda sign that the future is bright now\nI fuck around, do the right thing like Spike now\nThe quick and the dead, which one is my lookalike now?\nI'm moving ahead\n\nEverything's changing around me\nAnd I want to change too\nIt's one thing I know\nIt ain't cool being no fool\nI feel different today\nI don't know what else to say\nBut I'mma get my shit together\nIt's now or never\n\nOpportunities lost because I blew them\nOn the sunniest days of my life, I cry through them\nMom's out the picture and Pops, I barely knew him\nAnd I would pray to God but I'm tired of lying to him\nTired of trying to run from the things inside of us\nGot a lot of fam, and a lot of admirers\nWho tell me that I should aspire to be changed\nBut when I think of changing, it's like why even try this shit?\nMy mind hazy and my thoughts, they get distorted\nI know my good and bad deeds both get recorded\nYou do right so your soul can last\nBut my role is cast before I even audition for it\nSo I don't really see an end to my vice\nIt's just false reformation, no end of my strife\nFeel the evil overpowering, you can go ahead throw the towel in\nCause nigga, that's the end of the fight\nWhen you can only see the tunnel at the end of the light\nLights out, party over, it's the end of your life\nAnd I'm out\n\nEverything's changing around me\nAnd I want to change too\nIt's one thing I know\nIt ain't cool being no fool\nI feel different today\nI don't know what else to say\nBut I'mma get my shit together\nIt's now or never\n\nWhen I look into the mirror and see my own image\nIt feels like there's something else far in the distance\nSomething I wanna see, but something that's resistant\nAnd everyday the haunting is growing more persistent\nI never noticed it before, but now I can't miss it\nAnd the constant pounding is driving me ballistic\nI ran from it for years, but it's still next to me\nAnd it's growing stronger, taking even less of me\nI can't fight it now, I know it's just destiny\nAnd I just wonder what's gonna happen when it catches me\nWill it leave me face down in the Chesapeake?\nOr will it just start bringing out the best in me?\nBut is the best in me really just the worst in me\nAnd if so, yesterday could be my anniversary\nIn sinner's court, sip port and have church with me\nI'm trying to get rid of these ghosts that's cursing me\nI'm feeling change is an absolute certainty\nCause what's going on is a state of emergency"}}, {"title": "One Shine", "album": "Illadelph Halflife", "year": null, "lyrics": "Making way for

economize\nReal rap, no tale spinning\nSuch is the life of a Kamikaze pilot\nWe wylin' out of control\nUntil we all make the funny papers like Comic-Con\nFeared in all streets so, if you ever see me out in y\u2019all streets\nFind another one to occupy\nI never hope for the best, I wish a nigga would\nTurn around and walk away, I wish a nigga could\nListen to my instincts and say fuck the rest\nBut once you\u2019ve had the best better ain\u2019t as good\nWeak-heartedness cannot be involved\nStick to the script, nigga -- fuck your improv\nLike the samurai\nThe street\u2019s Hammurabi Code\nPlay your part, shut the fuck up, and do as I was told\n\nI was always late for the bus\nJust once can I be on time\nThen I start to think what\u2019s the rush\nWho wants to be on time\nFeeling unlucky and if I ever got lucky it was one time\nIn this crazy world\n\nNot a thing I fear besides fear itself\nThis is clearly a lesson learned for someone else\nReach for the crown of thorns upon the shelf\nCross around my neck\nI\u2019ve been taught by stealth\nCapture this moment in time\u2026 it\u2019s a smash and grab\nAnd where my party people y\u2019all finna have a blast\nYou say goodbye\u2026 I say hello first and last\nHello-Hello\u2026 Now all of y\u2019all elevate your glass\nTo an example of what time will do to you\nWhen those nameless things just keep on eluding you\nWhen shit is new to you and lies is true to you\nWords of suspects-usual\u2026 coming though to you\nMan, I guess if I was ever lucky it was one time\nThen I went missing looking for the sublime\nA nigga stayed low, left the ladder unclimbed\nTime after time, verse blank, the line unrhymed\n\nYou ever wonder what\u2019s the big fuss..\nFor everyone be on time\nWhat\u2019s the big deal, why do they feel\nThe need to have us marching on line\nFeeling unlucky and if I\u2019d ever got lucky it was one time\nIn this crazy world\n\nI wonder when you die do you hear harps and bagpipes\nIf you born on the other side of the crack pipe\nNiggas learn math just to understand the crack price\nThen dive in head first like the jack knife\nCause out here, yo you niggas can\u2019t belly flop\nIf you wanna make the noise inside your belly stop\nOne time means being on the front line\nBeing on the front line means ducking one time\nThe pendulum swinging my way- couldn\u2019t be more blind\nNiggas talk to the cops? Not even one time\nCause we all going down just like the subprime\nOr a cheap ass half gallon of Ballantine\nBut hopping over gates to escape is sublime\nThen through the alley way and down to the sub line\nTales from the streets\nA life of high crime\nTo make it to the bottom\nSuch a high climb\n\nI was always late for the bus\nJust once can I be on time\nThen I start to think what\u2019s the rush\nWho wants to be on time\nFeeling unlucky and if I ever got lucky it was one time\nIn this crazy world", "image": "https://images.genius.com/bb007a34227e5b87c6581b2f3722077e.1000x1000x1.jpg", "artist": "The Roots", "raw": {"annotation_count": 36, "api_path": "/songs/58434", "description": {"dom": {"tag": "root", "children": [{"tag": "p", "children": ["This ", {"tag": "em", "children": ["undun"]}, " tune finds the album\u2019s narrator, Redford, reflecting on the spiritual emptiness and pressures of his street life.

talking\nIf too much money talking, we make 'em economize\nReal rap, no tale spinning\nSuch is the life of a Kamikaze pilot\nWe wylin' out of control\nUntil we all make the funny papers like Comic-Con\nFeared in all streets so, if you ever see me out in y\u2019all streets\nFind another one to occupy\nI never hope for the best, I wish a nigga would\nTurn around and walk away, I wish a nigga could\nListen to my instincts and say fuck the rest\nBut once you\u2019ve had the best better ain\u2019t as good\nWeak-heartedness cannot be involved\nStick to the script, nigga -- fuck your improv\nLike the samurai\nThe street\u2019s Hammurabi Code\nPlay your part, shut the fuck up, and do as I was told\n\nI was always late for the bus\nJust once can I be on time\nThen I start to think what\u2019s the rush\nWho wants to be on time\nFeeling unlucky and if I ever got lucky it was one time\nIn this crazy world\n\nNot a thing I fear besides fear itself\nThis is clearly a lesson learned for someone else\nReach for the crown of thorns upon the shelf\nCross around my neck\nI\u2019ve been taught by stealth\nCapture this moment in time\u2026 it\u2019s a smash and grab\nAnd where my party people y\u2019all finna have a blast\nYou say goodbye\u2026 I say hello first and last\nHello-Hello\u2026 Now all of y\u2019all elevate your glass\nTo an example of what time will do to you\nWhen those nameless things just keep on eluding you\nWhen shit is new to you and lies is true to you\nWords of suspects-usual\u2026 coming though to you\nMan, I guess if I was ever lucky it was one time\nThen I went missing looking for the sublime\nA nigga stayed low, left the ladder unclimbed\nTime after time, verse blank, the line unrhymed\n\nYou ever wonder what\u2019s the big fuss..\nFor everyone be on time\nWhat\u2019s the big deal, why do they feel\nThe need to have us marching on line\nFeeling unlucky and if I\u2019d ever got lucky it was one time\nIn this crazy world\n\nI wonder when you die do you hear harps and bagpipes\nIf you born on the other side of the crack pipe\nNiggas learn math just to understand the crack price\nThen dive in head first like the jack knife\nCause out here, yo you niggas can\u2019t belly flop\nIf you wanna make the noise inside your belly stop\nOne time means being on the front line\nBeing on the front line means ducking one time\nThe pendulum swinging my way- couldn\u2019t be more blind\nNiggas talk to the cops? Not even one time\nCause we all going down just like the subprime\nOr a cheap ass half gallon of Ballantine\nBut hopping over gates to escape is sublime\nThen through the alley way and down to the sub line\nTales from the streets\nA life of high crime\nTo make it to the bottom\nSuch a high climb\n\nI was always late for the bus\nJust once can I be on time\nThen I start to think what\u2019s the rush\nWho wants to be on time\nFeeling unlucky and if I ever got lucky it was one time\nIn this crazy world"}}, {"title": "Outro", "album": "Illadelph Halflife", "year": null, "lyrics": "For now, the

Pass the popcorn (8X)\nYo, I wrote this, basement, Never Never Tunnel type portion\nJust to accompany some audio distortion\nBust the popcorn, drop it ons my cassette and\nYo Crumbs, umm, how you feel? I hope it's blessed man\nDig The Square Roots be the setters of examples\nFindin mad rhythm in the static of your samples\nQuick to make you move to my groove as I soothe\nThe ear of the listener on the musical\nPrisoner G, now you're free you can be all you wanna be\nGo where you want or go and see all you wanna see\nBecause yo, your ambitions I won't neglect\nAnd to them brothers who ain't here, nuff respect\nSo BROther Quest, how ya livin, what ya givin black?\nTo me the brother with the linens and the applejacks;\nBusy til the break of dawn\nThe first verse is born I pass the popcorn\nPass the what? Pass the popcorn (4X)\nSay what?\nPass the what? Pass the popcorn (4X)\nSecondly, I speak for the ?uest from the S-Q-T (Square Roots)\nAnd I'm Black Thought, therefore you know it's funky\nThe rhythms he recycles sometimes prehistoric\nThe mic for the popcorn's like metaphoric (it's metaphoric baby)\nSo many different factors in a ?uestion style\nCause he's the father and he's giving more than one child\nThe abstract soloist, drummin from the heart\nAll the way from Philly in the West part\nRelax your mind and let your body be at rest\nFlow in slow mo', and let the BROther manifest\nNow the second verse has been born\nI'm Black Thought and I pass the popcorn\nOn to Kid Crumb I pass the popcorn\nPass the what? Pass the popcorn (4X)\nSay what?\nPass the what? Pass the popcorn (4X)\nFrom the Southern section of Philly my affection\nAffiliates me with kids, from the store to pastry\nThe Foreign Object, direct from ? with the skit\nThat be rugged, it was the drumsticks and the buckets\nBack in the days, now the Rubber Band plays to accompany\n?uestion upon the drums and displays mad soul\nSoul be the source of the blam Roots fam\nAs we grow and expand like the afro\nWith menacing music seriously I'm sinister\nI shout, move about, turn it out like minister\nDiggin the flip-side when I slide I gets biz with\nMad melanin, chocolate, like a chip that's black man\nFrom the dark room with the mad raps homegrown\nKnots and knaps upon the dome from thinkin\nI'm sinkin in the sound cause I gets and got down\nLettin Black Thought's out of lockdown, buckshot\nLick it to the tick of my measure's on the Richter\nGrits getter so grab your sister\nI get wreck so check my respect from the wreck\nThat I've gotten biting this'll make your fronts turn rotten\nThe original, rock chewer, from a duo\nWhatever called po' folkers or Crumbs, and his mouth broke\nKids wanna laugh so I blast on your ass to - wait see\nChase me and see if you catch the circular knot\nStyle buckwild the acoustic boom\nSquare Root of Black Thought broadcast with the popcorn\nIt's like that y'all\nThe popcorn popcorn as I pass y'all\nI go..\nPass the what? Pass the popcorn (4X)\nC'mon\nPass the what? Pass the popcorn (4X)\nC'mon", "image": "https://images.genius.com/5f976d748fe1652a2c1c665cec0d2a91.608x608x1.jpg", "artist": "The Roots", "raw": {"annotation_count": 6, "api_path": "/songs/40460",

I hope it's blessed man\nDig The Square Roots be the setters of examples\nFindin mad rhythm in the static of your samples\nQuick to make you move to my groove as I soothe\nThe ear of the listener on the musical\nPrisoner G, now you're free you can be all you wanna be\nGo where you want or go and see all you wanna see\nBecause yo, your ambitions I won't neglect\nAnd to them brothers who ain't here, nuff respect\nSo BROther Quest, how ya livin, what ya givin black?\nTo me the brother with the linens and the applejacks;\nBusy til the break of dawn\nThe first verse is born I pass the popcorn\nPass the what? Pass the popcorn (4X)\nSay what?\nPass the what? Pass the popcorn (4X)\nSecondly, I speak for the ?uest from the S-Q-T (Square Roots)\nAnd I'm Black Thought, therefore you know it's funky\nThe rhythms he recycles sometimes prehistoric\nThe mic for the popcorn's like metaphoric (it's metaphoric baby)\nSo many different factors in a ?uestion style\nCause he's the father and he's giving more than one child\nThe abstract soloist, drummin from the heart\nAll the way from Philly in the West part\nRelax your mind and let your body be at rest\nFlow in slow mo', and let the BROther manifest\nNow the second verse has been born\nI'm Black Thought and I pass the popcorn\nOn to Kid Crumb I pass the popcorn\nPass the what? Pass the popcorn (4X)\nSay what?\nPass the what? Pass the popcorn (4X)\nFrom the Southern section of Philly my affection\nAffiliates me with kids, from the store to pastry\nThe Foreign Object, direct from ? with the skit\nThat be rugged, it was the drumsticks and the buckets\nBack in the days, now the Rubber Band plays to accompany\n?uestion upon the drums and displays mad soul\nSoul be the source of the blam Roots fam\nAs we grow and expand like the afro\nWith menacing music seriously I'm sinister\nI shout, move about, turn it out like minister\nDiggin the flip-side when I slide I gets biz with\nMad melanin, chocolate, like a chip that's black man\nFrom the dark room with the mad raps homegrown\nKnots and knaps upon the dome from thinkin\nI'm sinkin in the sound cause I gets and got down\nLettin Black Thought's out of lockdown, buckshot\nLick it to the tick of my measure's on the Richter\nGrits getter so grab your sister\nI get wreck so check my respect from the wreck\nThat I've gotten biting this'll make your fronts turn rotten\nThe original, rock chewer, from a duo\nWhatever called po' folkers or Crumbs, and his mouth broke\nKids wanna laugh so I blast on your ass to - wait see\nChase me and see if you catch the circular knot\nStyle buckwild the acoustic boom\nSquare Root of Black Thought broadcast with the popcorn\nIt's like that y'all\nThe popcorn popcorn as I pass y'all\nI go..\nPass the what?

to splash\nI can make Conan and the Titans clash\nAnd I could make Metallica and Guns 'N Roses thrash\nUsed to smash crash parties like I was disturbed\nUsed to make plots against the herringbone herb\nBut now, all I do disperse the verb\nAnd like a nerd I can make you say, \"He's superb\"\nWorded perfect, never ever shall you misinterpret\nI move styles like bowels so now you know I'm worth

dresser got my mind on trauma\nSo my persona's marijuana most melodic with the melodrama\nThe Ben Frank folder, the mic holder\nCommand it with a planet on my shoulder till the sound's over\nKeep it underground my style subterranean\nIll Philadelph Pennsylvanian\nBack on the tour to entertrain again, whoops\nI meant to say to entertain I'm in a planetary mode\nWatch as I explode through your area

extreme and exquisite but ask it is it\nMy style is like a cat from a seventies flick\nTalkin jive as he strut with his afro pick\nOr a predator, just before he stalks his pray\nWhen I talk this way, I do dismay\nSee you're puzzled, now how I think you're trying to juggle\nMy mind is like a nine M double, now there's trouble\nThe Roots bring you styles and all types of creed\nI sign off but I

Black Thought in the house\nRepresentin the Roots, y'all know how we do\nProceed Beatminerz remix one time for your mind\nIt's on\nVerse One: Black Thought\nYo, I never sweat it, it's all copacetic\nIn this lyrical profession rappers I discredit\nIt's fact that a fraction of the rap population\nIs pathetic not thorough\nHere come the kid that's got it like Al Jarreau\nI restin in the wild burough where it's\nAll realism never fiction\nAnd ghettoes is forever friction\nClash for cash gettin status and crabs is froze\nCaught up in the mixing\nThe mic's my only apparatus\nAnd with it I got rappers paranoid\nLyrical freakazoid, leapin out the terror void\nGuard your era it's the Black Thought ain't nothing lesser\nThan the MC oppressor, poetry professor\nI pound this MC on my dresser got my mind on trauma\nSo my persona's marijuana most melodic with the melodrama\nThe Ben Frank folder, the mic holder\nCommand it with a planet on my shoulder till the sound's over\nKeep it underground my style subterranean\nIll Philadelph Pennsylvanian\nBack on the tour to entertrain again, whoops\nI meant to say to entertain I'm in a planetary mode\nWatch as I explode through your area code with dialect\nY'all niggas know the time when the Thought catch wreck\nY'all niggas know the science on the Dice Raw and Malik B\nKid I'm nice y'all searchin for a beat\nIt's the master of literature that's pure\nYou're checkin for\nComing down I keep it real and hardcore\nY'all know the score\nFour four that's the major, Black Thought I got\nThe flavor you need\nAnd I shall proceed\nChorus:\n*Beatminerz cut and scratch the chorus of Proceed*\nVerse Two: Malik B\nI can make you dance, I can make you shout\nThe scripts in the scroll turned the whole party out\nInject my lyrics in a sec with dialect\nWhy accept, because it's from the highest eye and depth\nRap extrordinaire share me never ever\nSee through because I be true, Malik's together\nIntox your cells till your brain vein swells\nNiggas'll claim terror when their never parellel\nOnce I have a hunch that there's MC's that front\nI just crunched a whole bunch, in one big munch\nI always stand firm, under any term\nMy actions never squirm cuz my tracks is perm\nI have a tendency to defend this MC\nMy residency is simply in sensei\nI makes it vivid, on different continents of Earth I pivot\nIt seems extreme and exquisite but ask it is it\nMy style is like a cat from a seventies flick\nTalkin jive as he strut with his afro pick\nOr a predator, just before he stalks his pray\nWhen I talk this way, I do dismay\nSee you're puzzled, now how I think you're trying to juggle\nMy mind is like a nine M double, now there's trouble\nThe Roots bring you styles and all types of creed\nI sign off but I shall proceed\nChorus"}}, {"title": "Push Up Ya Lighter", "album": "Illadelph Halflife", "year": null, "lyrics": "To all my peoples on the planet stimulatin the mind\nAll my peoples that be knowin the

powerful than cocaine\nFreaks dancin' in a line like Soul Train\nTo get your pride up, that extra push\nNiggas lookin' for the time of their life, coppin' a rush\nYo I know sis', dawg, her name Lorraine\nShe's a thick brick house with a chocolate frame\nI went to school with her\nTwelfth grade, I used to fool with her\nShe put me on with her squad, I got cool with her\nShe used to say she wanted to be a doctor\nAnd couldn't nothin' stop her\nFrom gettin' up that cash\nFor tuition, even if she had to shake that ass\nFucked up, her money ain't accumulate that fast\nLorraine know it's real, and sex controls America\nTurn the TV on, it's in the open on the regular, yo\nWhat the freaks in the video for?\nFuck a song, gimme a thong, and pussy galore\nYou see, life is about marketing pussy galore\nEvery time I turn around, there's more pussy galore\nNations going to war for the pussy galore\nEither the cash, the raw, or the pussy galore\nYo, gang wars, more pussy galore\nFrom the screen to the record store, pussy galore\nEvery time I turn around, there's more pussy galore\nEither the cash, the raw, or the pussy galore\n\nYo, desire and lust can make a man kill\nOr jump off the bridge, cuffed to a motherfuckin' anvil\nSo it's promoted like it's all y'all know\nKeep a nigga under the spell, you under control\nBut yo, I seen it make people slit they wrists\nWeakness, pussy make a spy say secrets\nBut what for? Cause sex is the law\nAnd been many an empire rise and fall\nFrom the squares to the players\nTo the pimps to the whores\nTo big checks that never would have been endorsed\nYa know, I sit back and just peep thangs\n9 outta 10, it's the same songs, only the beat change\nSo don't be lookin' at Tariq strange\nWhen I conduct a little Litmus test up in your heat range\nThat's when you see me up on stage with six\nWicked ass chicks fittin to get crunk with this\nLife is about marketing pussy galore\nEvery time I turn around, there's more pussy galore\nCorporations going to war over the pussy galore\nEither the cash, the raw, or the pussy galore\nYo, gang wars, more pussy galore\nFrom the screen to the record stores, pussy galore\nEvery time I turn around, there's more pussy galore\nEvery time I turn around, there's more pussy galore\n\nYo, fresh cut, with the thick black velour\nWith the black Louis sneaks, headed out for tour\nLookin' out the limo window up at the billboards\n200 miles, she was the only thing I saw\nPromotin' everything, from the liquor to the nicotine\nCell phones, anti-histamines, chicken wings\nYou gotta show a little skin to get them listening\nFor real yo, the world is a sex machine\nFull of pretty freaks in designer jeans\nThat go to extremes to conjure all kinds of schemes\nHalf the time, it ain't even responsibly\nTryin' to take me some place I'm not tryin to be\nGhetto, Sin City, where the P is free\nYou catch a bid far worser than a 1 to 3\nAll up in the after-hours on the second floor\nFor that good thing, that keep 'em comin' back for more, ya heard me\nIt's about marketing the pussy galore\nEvery time I turn around, there's more pussy galore\nNations going to war for the pussy galore\nEither the cash, the raw, or the pussy galore\nDig it, gang wars, more pussy galore\nFrom the screen to the record store, pussy galore\nEither the cash, the raw, or the pussy galore\nMore pussy galore, more pussy galore\nYo, dancin' on the dance floor\nGirl, it's you that I adore\nStep off stage and scream for more\nAll I see, pussy galore\nSnap my fingers, make you mine\nIf not, I'll snap a second time\nAfter that, I guarantee\nYou will be standing next to me\nDancin' on the dance floor\nGirl, it's you that I adore\nStep off stage and scream for more\nAll I see, pussy galore\nSnap my fingers, make you mine\nIf not, I'll snap a second time\nAfter that, I guarantee\nYou will be standing next to me", "image": "https://images.genius.com/3b63864c76b254cbac7ffb7d3e83f789.600x600x1.jpg", "artist": "The Roots", "raw": {"annotation_count": 15, "api_path": "/songs/40477", "description": {"dom": {"tag": "root", "children": [{"tag": "p", "children": ["Off the 2002 album Phrenology."]}, "", {"tag": "p", "children": ["Pussy Galore was the name of a character in the 1964 James Bond movie \u201cGoldfinger,\u201d but here it\u2019s the pervasive and often destructive presence of sexuality in our pop culture.

and scream for more\nAll I see, pussy galore\nSnap my fingers, make you mine\nIf not, I'll snap a second time\nAfter that, I guarantee\nYou will be standing next to me\n\nYo, my old head once said, it's more powerful than cocaine\nFreaks dancin' in a line like Soul Train\nTo get your pride up, that extra push\nNiggas lookin' for the time of their life, coppin' a rush\nYo I know sis', dawg, her name Lorraine\nShe's a thick brick house with a chocolate frame\nI went to school with her\nTwelfth grade, I used to fool with her\nShe put me on with her squad, I got cool with her\nShe used to say she wanted to be a doctor\nAnd couldn't nothin' stop her\nFrom gettin' up that cash\nFor tuition, even if she had to shake that ass\nFucked up, her money ain't accumulate that fast\nLorraine know it's real, and sex controls America\nTurn the TV on, it's in the open on the regular, yo\nWhat the freaks in the video for?\nFuck a song, gimme a thong, and pussy galore\nYou see, life is about marketing pussy galore\nEvery time I turn around, there's more pussy galore\nNations going to war for the pussy galore\nEither the cash, the raw, or the pussy galore\nYo, gang wars, more pussy galore\nFrom the screen to the record store, pussy galore\nEvery time I turn around, there's more pussy galore\nEither the cash, the raw, or the pussy galore\n\nYo, desire and lust can make a man kill\nOr jump off the bridge, cuffed to a motherfuckin' anvil\nSo it's promoted like it's all y'all know\nKeep a nigga under the spell, you under control\nBut yo, I seen it make people slit they wrists\nWeakness, pussy make a spy say secrets\nBut what for? Cause sex is the law\nAnd been many an empire rise and fall\nFrom the squares to the players\nTo the pimps to the whores\nTo big checks that never would have been endorsed\nYa know, I sit back and just peep thangs\n9 outta 10, it's the same songs, only the beat change\nSo don't be lookin' at Tariq strange\nWhen I conduct a little Litmus test up in your heat range\nThat's when you see me up on stage with six\nWicked ass chicks fittin to get crunk with this\nLife is about marketing pussy galore\nEvery time I turn around, there's more pussy galore\nCorporations going to war over the pussy galore\nEither the cash, the raw, or the pussy galore\nYo, gang wars, more pussy galore\nFrom the screen to the record stores, pussy galore\nEvery time I turn around, there's more pussy galore\nEvery time I turn around, there's more pussy galore\n\nYo, fresh cut, with the thick black velour\nWith the black Louis sneaks, headed out for tour\nLookin' out the limo window up at the billboards\n200 miles, she was the only thing I saw\nPromotin' everything, from the liquor to the nicotine\nCell phones, anti-histamines, chicken wings\nYou gotta show a little skin to get them listening\nFor real yo, the world is a sex machine\nFull of pretty freaks in designer jeans\nThat go to extremes to conjure all kinds of schemes\nHalf the time, it ain't even responsibly\nTryin' to take me some place I'm not tryin to be\nGhetto, Sin City, where the P is free\nYou catch a bid far worser than a 1 to 3\nAll up in the after-hours on the second floor\nFor that good thing, that keep 'em comin' back for more, ya heard me\nIt's about marketing the pussy galore\nEvery time I turn around, there's more pussy galore\nNations going to war for the pussy galore\nEither the cash, the raw, or the pussy galore\nDig it, gang wars, more pussy galore\nFrom the screen to the record store, pussy galore\nEither the cash, the raw, or the pussy galore\nMore pussy galore, more pussy galore\nYo, dancin' on the dance floor\nGirl, it's you that I adore\nStep off stage and scream for more\nAll I see, pussy galore\nSnap my fingers, make you mine\nIf not, I'll snap a second time\nAfter that, I guarantee\nYou will be standing next to me\nDancin' on the dance floor\nGirl, it's you that I adore\nStep off stage and scream for more\nAll I see, pussy galore\nSnap my fingers, make you mine\nIf not, I'll snap a

cheeba yo, soul shock yo)\n(Give it everything you got yo)\n(Once again it's time, it's time)\nIt's time to ride, ride....\n\nYo, piss in the staircase, blood on the pavement\nI fill the quills with it let it spill on the pages\nCompose another anthem for the killers and manglers\nVillains and wranglers, fifth still in the chamber\nShit, I'm scientific but my reflex's gangsta\nPull out-rageous arms from the floor of the basement\nThen bust 'nuff talons if my peoplez in danger\nI'm Larry Davis, duckin' helicopter, hoverin' government agents\nWe muscle the language\nWhat we spit will leave your shit in utter amazement\nI'm hot brolic call it contagious\nThe shit the Roots started got these other artists going through changes\nMy vision is the strangest, the rhythm is anguish\nY'all niggas on the titty in your formative stages\nIs something in the iris and the way I spit\nThat tell these other crab rappers I ain't fo' no shit\nBlack traumatic, so there you have it\nMy battin' average, abort full of graphic assault, it's all classic\nThought, put ass-backwards rappers in a small package\nExperience is all that is, I'm well established\nMe and the mic in holy matrimony like a marriage\nThe technique in your reach, if only you could have it\nFor me it's automatic, it's na-tu-ral, I'm mad thoro\nPoet for hired pack metal\nYou feel me?\n\n\nYo, the load heavy\nWe walk around a little edgy, all ready and steady\nWithdrawal like Darryl Strawberry, it figures\nNiggas mad from them ghetto sandwiches and swine\nCryin' hard times, disadvantegeous, man listen\nThe story in the ghetto the same\nSeem like it's just some things that never will change\nGive birth to a style and won't give it a name\nTalk 'bout consciousness it's a different thang\nEnvision again, the honorable 'Riq, general Hannibal speak\nThe understandable diabolique, animal style\nOut of your dreams kid, you proud that you seen this\nFifth supreme linguist, a lyrical genious\nInject you with the broke down english\nThe most freshest and cleanest, 'Riq G's, guess what the theme is\nKareem's beat makin' me fiendish\nDon't act shaky and squeamish, if you real make me believe it nigga\n\n\nYo, the rebel Che Gueverra\nYou felt another date, you better\nDon't copped off, create it just save your cheddar\nI hit the studio with a pen and a vendetta\nSippin' an ice cold Beck, huffin' the tenth letter\nDriftin', shots lickin while the plot thickens\nSands in the hourglass thinnin', the last inning\nThe flash and the cash and the fast women\nIt's nothing, a lust for the crabs keep the passion and\nBlaow, kissin' my tablet with firing pins\nPoke holes in the plastic for oxygen\nMCs jumpin' out shoes and socks again\nMust have seen their face in the news it's gots to been\nThought known as the cure for cancer\nSame corrupt city as Mumia the Panther\nMan to man, hammer cocked, block and standoff\nBang, gunfire slang up in the dance hall\nYo, I hold the mic that could be thrown as a pipe bomb\nBring it just to sling it at your favorite icon\nThing about my music is it ain't shit like y'all\nThought, diesel like a 28-inch python\nYou know what I'm saying?\nWhen I'm on the mic there won't be no delayin...", "image": "https://images.genius.com/3b63864c76b254cbac7ffb7d3e83f789.600x600x1.jpg", "artist": "The Roots", "raw": {"annotation_count": 23,

yo)\n(Give it everything you got yo)\n(Once again it's time, it's time)\nIt's time to ride, ride....\n\nYo, piss in the staircase, blood on the pavement\nI fill the quills with it let it spill on the pages\nCompose another anthem for the killers and manglers\nVillains and wranglers, fifth still in the chamber\nShit, I'm scientific but my reflex's gangsta\nPull out-rageous arms from the floor of the basement\nThen bust 'nuff talons if my peoplez in danger\nI'm Larry Davis, duckin' helicopter, hoverin' government agents\nWe muscle the language\nWhat we spit will leave your shit in utter amazement\nI'm hot brolic call it contagious\nThe shit the Roots started got these other artists going through changes\nMy vision is the strangest, the rhythm is anguish\nY'all niggas on the titty in your formative stages\nIs something in the iris and the way I spit\nThat tell these other crab rappers I ain't fo' no shit\nBlack traumatic, so there you have it\nMy battin' average, abort full of graphic assault, it's all classic\nThought, put ass-backwards rappers in a small package\nExperience is all that is, I'm well established\nMe and the mic in holy matrimony like a marriage\nThe technique in your reach, if only you could have it\nFor me it's automatic, it's na-tu-ral, I'm mad thoro\nPoet for hired pack metal\nYou feel me?\n\n\nYo, the load heavy\nWe walk around a little edgy, all ready and steady\nWithdrawal like Darryl Strawberry, it figures\nNiggas mad from them ghetto sandwiches and swine\nCryin' hard times, disadvantegeous, man listen\nThe story in the ghetto the same\nSeem like it's just some things that never will change\nGive birth to a style and won't give it a name\nTalk 'bout consciousness it's a different thang\nEnvision again, the honorable 'Riq, general Hannibal speak\nThe understandable diabolique, animal style\nOut of your dreams kid, you proud that you seen this\nFifth supreme linguist, a lyrical genious\nInject you with the broke down english\nThe most freshest and cleanest, 'Riq G's, guess what the theme is\nKareem's beat makin' me fiendish\nDon't act shaky and squeamish, if you real make me believe it nigga\n\n\nYo, the rebel Che Gueverra\nYou felt another date, you better\nDon't copped off, create it just save your cheddar\nI hit the studio with a pen and a vendetta\nSippin' an ice cold Beck, huffin' the tenth letter\nDriftin', shots lickin while the plot thickens\nSands in the hourglass thinnin', the last inning\nThe flash and the cash and the fast women\nIt's nothing, a lust for the crabs keep the passion and\nBlaow, kissin' my tablet with firing pins\nPoke holes in the plastic for oxygen\nMCs jumpin' out shoes and socks again\nMust have seen their face in the news it's gots to been\nThought known as the cure for cancer\nSame corrupt city as Mumia the Panther\nMan to man, hammer cocked, block and standoff\nBang, gunfire slang up in the dance hall\nYo, I hold the mic that could be thrown as a pipe bomb\nBring it just to sling it at your favorite icon\nThing about my music is it ain't shit like y'all\nThought, diesel like a 28-inch python\nYou know what I'm saying?\nWhen I'm on the mic there won't be no delayin..."}}, {"title": "Radio Daze", "album": "How I Got Over", "year": "2010-06-22", "lyrics": "And the radio daze kept us in the dark\nAnd the satellite age brings us to the

you alone\n(Never, never leave you alone\nNever, never leave you alone)\n\nSo what you searching for? From birth\nBorn hurting and yearning for certain somethings\nLurking and murk them, got them turning this\nBed into a coffin, burning over passions in this passion\nOr more or less over what the pastor passed us\nCause see, the past tense, it never really passes\nPhases that trap us and cage us like classes\nFogging my glasses, lost in a mass mess\nTask-less dilemma to match somebody's status\nAnd I'm average as fuck, no car cats gassing me up\nPassing bucks like a casual blunt\nGranted, hustling habits on the stump of a mansion\nWhile bums pass, asking for a buck for some bagged bricks\nBad shit going down on the daily\nWhile bad chicks pass in a Mercedez, damn\nThey see he's the bastard for chasing them\nMaybe, it's the patterns that make me that made me...crazy\n\nAnd the radio daze kept us in the dark\nAnd the satellite age brings us to the light\nSome feeling the pitch, some feeling the bite\nThey ain't ready to talk, they're ready to fight\nNever leave you alone\n(Never, never leave you alone\nNever, never leave you alone)\nNever leave you alone\n(Never, never leave you alone\nNever, never leave you alone)\n\nLife is fiction, competition and contradiction\nPetty perceptions, window dressing for misdirection\nLove is a lotto, I know I know you know what I know\nHope is so hollow, that's why winos follow the bottle\nAnd people pressure, make death a hidden treasure\nA guilty pleasure, lonely language inside a letter\nIt's now or never, move it, move it, love it or lose it\n'Fore it's recruited, then included in something stupid\nIt's things of nature, paid a player and say your prayers\nNaysayers, the haters, the major players, the beggars\nYou 'bout it, 'bout it, don't allow it to pow without it\nThen those who doubt it, doomed to die the death of cowards\nThe world is yours, and the world we can't afford\nSo ignore the law; start a fire, then start a war\nIf you're sick and tired of your access denied\nFree will died long before blogs and iPod\n\nAnd the radio daze kept us in the dark\nAnd the satellite age brings us to the light\nSome feeling the pitch, some feeling the bite\nThey ain't ready to talk, they're ready to fight\nNever leave you alone\n(Never, never leave you alone\nNever, never leave you alone)\nNever leave you alone\n(Never, never leave you alone\nNever, never leave you alone)\n\nYo, it's too much strain for nominal gain\nI'm going through things; headaches, abdominal pain\nTryna numb it with that kettle like I'm from the Ukraine\nCheck the blue flame, lighter running out of butane\nWhat's up with my destructive urge that's unproductive\nChoices I'm stuck with, now starting to fuck with\nContaminating family and close friends\nTelling me to stop burning the candle at both ends\nAin't like I'm on a coke binge, hanging in dope dens\nOr life is just a pool of Patron I'm soaked in\nThe darker the covenant-slash-trainwreck for you to rubberneck\nYou ain't felt the true pain yet so you be loving that\nHit me up at black.gov like the government\nBanana Republican, alien intelligence\nKill switch, real pissed, thinking of some ill shit\nThe stone the builder refused, he need to build with\nGot immunized for both flus, I'm still sick\nVia satellite, radio, the realness\n\nAnd the radio daze kept us in the dark\nAnd the satellite age brings us to the light\nSome feeling the pitch, some feeling the bite\nThey ain't ready to talk, they're ready to fight\nAnd the radio daze\nAnd the radio daze\nAnd the radio daze"}}, {"title": "Respond/React", "album": "Illadelph Halflife", "year": null, "lyrics": "It's just - hip-hop hangin in my head heavy\nMalik said \"Riq, you know the planet ain't ready\nFor the half\" when we comin with the action pack\nOn some Dundee shit representin the outback\nYo, we do it like this (All the way live, from 2-1-5)\nYou witnessin the 5th Dynasty family click (All the way live, from 2-1-5)\nAcross the map, one time for ya (All the way live, from 2-1-5)\nIt's time to react to respond to react to respond (All the way live, from 2-1-5)\n\nWe settin it from Southside, pushin this up North\nFrom Illadelphian reps, to fly points across the map\nBring it back to Respond/React\nThen bring it back to Respond/React to this\n\nThe attractive assassin, blastin the devil trespassin\nMaster gettin cash in an orderly fashion\nMessage to the fake nigga flashin\nSlow up Ock, before you get dropped and closed like a caption\nFractional kids don't know the time for action\nStyles got the rhythm that of an Anglo-Saxon\nRound of applause, an avalanche of clappin\n{*BLOW*} that's what happen, now what's your reaction\nWe heavyweight traction, pro-pornographin\nSpecialize in science and math and, original black man\nBustin thoughts that pierce your mental\nThe fierce rippin your sacks and\nVocal toe to toe impeccable splittin your back son\nSimple as addition and subtraction\nBlack Thought, the infinite relaxed one\nShorties say they love it with a passion\nBring the international charm, see a squad I harass\n\nREACT, you best adapt when I sling this rap\nAnother chapter, before when I have to trap ya\nMap your whole path out\nGo get your crowd so we can clap out\nI drive down streets and take back route- positionin\nWhen I'm in your system like glycerin\nFans listenin, from Michigan to Switzerland\nMalik be blitzed again - on the station with the discipline\nSolicitin, sometimes illicit or explicit with it and\nFrom the deep end where the hills are steep\nNobody cares to speak, a land where life is cheap\nThe street mentality, mixed with the intellect\nPersonality, hell where I dwell as well\nNiggas rebellious, bodies are found down in the cellars\nMy man caught a shot to the stomach, now who want it?\nConfronted by these dusty blunted - cats who act like\nThey don't know that the fact is that they're bein hunted\nA process of elimination\nActivate your mind with the stimulation\nEnter your zone with penetration\nI've seen more horror than Bram Stroker\nStrip your broad or play poker, then drink mocha\nThe sometimes socializer, the joke despiser\nYou woke the wiser, dealin with the Roots vocalizer\nUp in your flesh from South Philly to West\nI stampede your style, I'll compile then bless\n - 2X\n\nHey yo, I'm just a lyricist, a chemist of the hemp\nThe beat pimp, the ill Philly resident\nThat's far from hesitant, corrupt like a President\nNever benevolent but poetically prevalent\nCooler than peppermint\nThe Lieutenant for niggas talkin bout represent\nNo doubt, it's obviously evident I get bent\nFar from temporary son I'm very permanent\nHittin MC's like an intoxicant, sent to prevent\nMonopoly is my intent, the means is what I invent\nThis mental murder pay the rent\nLyrically I'm the dominant ingredient, the swift extravagant\nSmooth lubricant, down with the M-the-Ill-itant\n(ch-ch-ch...)

right on\nIt was right on\nWe should shine a light on, a light on\nAnd the Book of Right On is right on\nIt was right on\n\nYo, I try to get it how I live it\nA lot of people counting on me kind of like a digit\nIt's a cold world, I'm not fronting like it isn't\nIt's no time for coming up shorter than a midget\nY'all know I'mma raise the bar though like Brigitte\nSee there a star go, don't blink, you might miss it\nIt's precious cargo you got to be strong to lift it\nThe light comes in different types, be more specific\nShit, I'm Black Thought what could be more prolific\nFor this love I go above and beyond the limit\nI told y'all I'm above and beyond a gimmick\nI get into your head and spread like a pandemic\nI never put myself in a race I can't finish\nI'm well grounded, founded on the same premise\nAs any man with a hit list that's about business\nYo can a brother get a witness? Dig it\nRight on\n\nWe should shine a light on, a light on\nAnd the Book of Right On is right on\nIt was right on\nWe should shine a light on, a light on\nAnd the Book of Right On is right on\nIt was right on\n\nOk I'm above and beyond hot, my measurement in watts\nTime rate of flow and energy ain't never going to stop\nPressure's on I won't pop, microphone I won't drop\nGemstones niggas cop ain't shit if I ain't in the spot\nIt's the Orion of the hop, the new star of the hip\nI shine a light for the future so my present's a gift\nIt's evident I'm heaven sent with Thomas Edison elements\nReverence for what I represent should show my benevolence\nThis is Philly, I'm repping for the art of the city\nCame from southwest Atlanta, gave my heart to the city\nWhere slugs fly, thugs cry, cause every part of it's gritty\nNiggas shooting up the club like they party with Diddy\nYou get the diggy? I flip my incandescents to flourescents\nAnd in essence I can burn 1000 joules of energy per second\nI put them on to lessons while I'm smoking on the blessing\nThe switch hitter like Pete Rose, right up the session\nRight on\n\nWe should shine a light on, a light on\nAnd the Book of Right On is right on\nIt was right on\nWe should shine a light on, a light on\nAnd the Book of Right On is right on\nIt was right on"}}, {"title": "Rising Down", "album": "Rising Down", "year": "2008-04-29", "lyrics": " - x4\nHello hello hello hello\n\nEvery anywhere: heights, plains, peaks or valleys\nEntrances, exits, vestibules and alleys\nWinding roads that test the firm nerve\nFortune or fatal behind the blind curve\nThe engine oil purr, lights flash to a blur\nSpeed work through the Earth, make your motor go 'scurrr'\nTonight at noon watch a bad moon rising\nIdentities in crisis and conflict diamonds\nBlinding, staring at lights 'til they cryin'\nBone gristle poppin' from continuous grindin'\nGrapes of wrath in a shapely glass\nIngredients influential on your ways and acts\nZero tolerance to raise the tax\nIt don't matter how your gates is latched\nYou ain't safe from the Danger Jack\nMade it way before they made the map or a G-P-S\nThis is D-E-F leader\n\nI know where I'm goin' even when it's dark\nAnd being led down that road\n(Hello hello hello hello)\nYou don't see that something's wrong\nEarth's spinnin' outta control\n(Hello hello hello hello)\nEverything's for sale, even souls\nSomeone get God on the phone\n(Hello hello hello hello)\nNorthside, nigga, Southside\n(Hello hello hello hello)\nShit's poppin' off worldwide\n(Hello hello hello hello)\n\nBetween the greenhouse gases\nAnd earth spinnin' off its axis\nGot Mother Nature doin' backflips\nThe natural disasters; it's like 80 degrees in Alaska\nYou in trouble if you not an Onassis\nIt ain't hard to tell that the conditions is drastic\nJust turn on the telly, check for the news flashin'\nHow you want it bagged: paper or plastic?\nLost in translation or just lost in traffic?\nYo I don't wanna floss; I done lost my passion\nAnd I ain't trying to climb; yo, I lost my traction\nThey makin' me break\nMy contents under pressure do not shake\nI'm workin' while the boss relaxin'\nHere come Mr. Taxman\nHe leavin' a fraction, give me back some\nMatter fact, next paycheck, it's like that, son\nI'll fuck around and have to hurt a few men\nThey probably chalk it up as a disturbing new trend\nHello\n\n\nShould I say \"hello\" or should I say that \"hell is low\"?\nAm I nigga or a niggero?\nI'm an African American; they sell drugs in the hood\nBut the man, he move the medicine\nHe'll prescribe you all meds for everythin'\nA little stuffy nose 'til you get some Claritin\nYou know I'm hip to it, and it's hard to claim the land\nWhen my great-great-great-grands were shipped to it\nLook at technology: they call it downloading\nI call it downsizing; somebody follow me\nDoes a computer chip have an astrology\nAnd when it fuck up could it give you an apology?\n(Could it?)\nShould it say \"hello\" or should it say \"goodbye\"?\nTry to understand how smart and how hood am I\nIt don't matter though\nUntil we learn that the world don't turn right\nWe all oughta scatter though\n\nI know where I'm goin\u2019 even when it's dark\nAnd being led down that road\n(Hello hello hello hello)\nYou don't see that something\u2019s wrong\nEarth's spinnin\u2019 outta control\n(Hello hello hello hello)\nEverything's for sale, even souls\nSomeone get God {got} on the phone\n(Hello

the blind curve\nThe engine oil purr, lights flash to a blur\nSpeed work through the Earth, make your motor go 'scurrr'\nTonight at noon watch a bad moon rising\nIdentities in crisis and conflict diamonds\nBlinding, staring at lights 'til they cryin'\nBone gristle poppin' from continuous grindin'\nGrapes of wrath in a shapely glass\nIngredients influential on your ways and acts\nZero tolerance to raise the tax\nIt don't matter how your gates is latched\nYou ain't safe from the Danger Jack\nMade it way before they made the map or a G-P-S\nThis is D-E-F leader\n\nI know where I'm goin' even when it's dark\nAnd being led down that road\n(Hello hello hello hello)\nYou don't see that something's wrong\nEarth's spinnin' outta control\n(Hello hello hello hello)\nEverything's for sale, even souls\nSomeone get God on the phone\n(Hello hello hello hello)\nNorthside, nigga, Southside\n(Hello hello hello hello)\nShit's poppin' off worldwide\n(Hello hello hello hello)\n\nBetween the greenhouse gases\nAnd earth spinnin' off its axis\nGot Mother Nature doin' backflips\nThe natural disasters; it's like 80 degrees in Alaska\nYou in trouble if you not an Onassis\nIt ain't hard to tell that the conditions is drastic\nJust turn on the telly, check for the news flashin'\nHow you want it bagged: paper or plastic?\nLost in translation or just lost in traffic?\nYo I don't wanna floss; I done lost my passion\nAnd I ain't trying to climb; yo, I lost my traction\nThey makin' me break\nMy contents under pressure do not shake\nI'm workin' while the boss relaxin'\nHere come Mr. Taxman\nHe leavin' a fraction, give me back some\nMatter fact, next paycheck, it's like that, son\nI'll fuck around and have to hurt a few men\nThey probably chalk it up as a disturbing new trend\nHello\n\n\nShould I say \"hello\" or should I say that \"hell is low\"?\nAm I nigga or a niggero?\nI'm an African American; they sell drugs in the hood\nBut the man, he move the medicine\nHe'll prescribe you all meds for everythin'\nA little stuffy nose 'til you get some Claritin\nYou know I'm hip to it, and it's hard to claim the land\nWhen my great-great-great-grands were shipped to it\nLook at technology: they call it downloading\nI call it downsizing; somebody follow me\nDoes a computer chip have an astrology\nAnd when it fuck up could it give you an apology?\n(Could it?)\nShould it say \"hello\" or should it say \"goodbye\"?\nTry to understand how smart and how hood am I\nIt don't matter though\nUntil we learn that the world don't turn right\nWe all oughta scatter though\n\nI know where I'm goin\u2019 even when it's dark\nAnd being led down that road\n(Hello hello hello hello)\nYou don't see that something\u2019s wrong\nEarth's spinnin\u2019 outta control\n(Hello hello hello hello)\nEverything's for sale, even souls\nSomeone get God {got} on the phone\n(Hello hello hello hello) "}}, {"title": "Rising Up", "album": "Rising Down", "year":

shape of a mack\nLook how I do it, yo I'm taking you back\nThis how you rise down to the foundation\nHow sacred is that?\nI'm from the number one place on the map\nThe generational gap with yet another sensational track\nAnd we don't stress for nothing I just press the button\nIt's as simple as just making it hap'\nTo all the frauds stop faking, relax\nAnd to the broads if you caking\nThen clap then shake it without breaking your back\nI know the world been waiting for that\nYou been aching for that cause\nWhat they playing on the station is whack\nAnd I'm a legend in the flesh that

the pulse is in us\nI got the Everclear flow, they mimosa with it\nWe are the hope of the culture, they supposed to listen\nAnd I'm supposed to pivot like I'm a forward in the league\nI'm Oden with it\nYet don't owe them niggas nothing but potent lyrics\nBut if you ain't got the dance they revoke your spinning\nSo good rappers ain't eating, they Olsen twining\nBut I'm so committed, they have grown familiar\nWith the counterfeit hitters they so-so with it\nBut they are Sosa with it\nThey Mark McGwire with the written, I'm Rodriguez\nOn the road to riches this is the fork I'm hitting\nThis is the trial-and-error era, no co-defendant\nI push The Seed every time like I'm Cody with it\nI said the one-hit wonders pneumonia to us\nI don't know you niggas\nHit the road, my nigga\n\n\nWhere my grimy figures at?\nLook lively addressing the captain\nShow me where your first impression is at\nAnd where your dedication to the true profession is at\nHow you laugh, answer me\n\"What kind of question is that?\"\nI'll show you where my rare essence is at, the adolescence of rap\nThe real muscle in the message of that\nMy name trouble I'm a blessing to rap\nAnd you can check my stats cuz worldwide they attesting to that\nSo nigga listen you can probably learn a lesson perhaps\nHow I'm like Bobby DeNiro, Joe Pesc and them cats\nAm I the unsung hero? Oh, yes\nIf you asking anybody that's aware of the classics\nThey'll tell you I'm a legend in the flesh that dress to impress\nThe best is that which I accept and nothing less\nMy stacks is

radio's been playing\nThe same song all day long\nSo I told her\nI got something you've been waiting for \n\nYesterday I saw a B-girl crying\nI walked up and asked what's wrong\nShe told me that the radio's been playing\nThe same song all day long\n(So get your glass, lift it up in the toast position\nWe getting paper like John Travolta get it\nCause we focused wit' it, we supposed to get it\nYou know me and my whole squad, we so committed\nWe not the kids cooling out on the sofa with it\nWe about to dominate the globe like Oprah did it\nWe getting paper like John Travolta, nigga)\n\nWell I'm a downtown shooter who that?\nThe crown ruler is back\nHe kind of grew into the shape of a mack\nLook how I do it, yo I'm taking you back\nThis how you rise down to the foundation\nHow sacred is that?\nI'm from the number one place on the map\nThe generational gap with yet another sensational track\nAnd we don't stress for nothing I just press the button\nIt's as simple as just making it hap'\nTo all the frauds stop faking, relax\nAnd to the broads if you caking\nThen clap then shake it without breaking your back\nI know the world been waiting for that\nYou been aching for that cause\nWhat they playing on the station is whack\nAnd I'm a legend in the flesh that dress to impress\nThe best is that which I accept and nothing less\nMy stacks is grotesque my squad, so fresh\nYou know it's Black Thought\nAnd your boy the bro ?uest, but\n\nHip-Hop ain't dead cause the pulse is in us\nI got the Everclear flow, they mimosa with it\nWe are the hope of the culture, they supposed to listen\nAnd I'm supposed to pivot like I'm a forward in the league\nI'm Oden with it\nYet don't owe them niggas nothing but potent lyrics\nBut if you ain't got the dance they revoke your spinning\nSo good rappers ain't eating, they Olsen twining\nBut I'm so committed, they have grown familiar\nWith the counterfeit hitters they so-so with it\nBut they are Sosa with it\nThey Mark McGwire with the written, I'm Rodriguez\nOn the road to riches this is the fork I'm hitting\nThis is the trial-and-error era, no co-defendant\nI push The Seed every time like I'm Cody with it\nI said the one-hit wonders pneumonia to us\nI don't know you niggas\nHit the road, my nigga\n\n\nWhere my grimy figures at?\nLook lively addressing the captain\nShow me where your first impression is at\nAnd where your dedication to the true profession is at\nHow you laugh, answer me\n\"What kind of question is that?\"\nI'll show you where my rare essence is at, the adolescence of rap\nThe real muscle in the message of that\nMy name trouble I'm a blessing to rap\nAnd you can check my stats cuz worldwide they attesting to that\nSo nigga listen you can probably learn a lesson perhaps\nHow I'm like Bobby DeNiro, Joe Pesc and them cats\nAm I the unsung hero? Oh, yes\nIf you asking anybody that's aware of the classics\nThey'll tell you I'm a legend in the flesh that dress to impress\nThe best is that which I accept and nothing less\nMy stacks is grotesque\nMy squad, so fresh\nYou know its Black Thought\nAnd your boy the bro ?uest, but"}}, {"title": "Rock You", "album": "Phrenology", "year": "2002-11-26", "lyrics": "Rock you {*repeat

Langston Hughes, put shanks in crews\nI debut to make the news and I've been killing it since\nStill in the trench, buzzin off the chillest suspense\nI want my niggas out that barbwire still in the fence\nVerbal assassin I'm a killer still in a sense\nRhymes is graphic\nAimin straight at your minds and blast that weak shit\nThe pieces and particles of fragments\nMad vocabulist, yes I must confess\nI'm like Diddy tryin to sink a slug in Elliots chest\nJust taste on that it's Black you can tell he a vet\nYou never knew that fate cut you until your belly was wet\nNew Delian cat the Fraggle Rock skully is split\nIt's Black coming, you can tell it's a hit\nComin to drop you nigga\n\nWe will Rock you {*repeat 6X*}\nYo yall savages is primitive, I'm true penmanship\nHere come the neuro-linguistic rap hypnotist\nMaking sound waves, prisoners outta the listeners\nLegendary magnificent dope distributors\nMan, I remain miles ahead of the game\nSlang play off the meter cause it's never the same\nNiggas tell me how they never comin better than plain\nThey love what I say, here come the rebel breaking the frame\nAnd the charts too, my earning bars arts is martial\nI'm comin to off you, I ain't tryin to argue\nWhen you least expect it I'm gonna step out the darkroom\nPull out the hardware tools the particles will spark you\nMy niggas wraps give a slice, I spit nice\nFucking around this twice as much as rhythm is rolling a dice\nTo choose one the noose or the gun\nCause you're getting banged or hanged, Thought second to none\nNigga\n\nYo check it out whether you ballin or just on the\nWall and groovin groovin\nWe've come to get it kickin and get the movement movin\nFor Tracey and Tamika and for Shelly and Susan\nStyles make you wonder what the hell he was usin\nRemember your development with melanin music\nSpit so many spears it's becoming a nuisance to some\nBut to whoever want to know who the truth is\nYou never heard another on the mic as ruthless\nI drink a little liquor a lot of water and juices\nIt make money ain't no need for makin excuses\nBurn you fuckin with a South Philly exclusive\nThem long dick niggas with real short fuses that go off\nChick likes Riq, you such a show off\nYou cut your locks down to a fro then cut your fro off\nI been at your show there ain't no way to cut your flow off\nYou got to be the illest emcee that people know of word\nI will rock you {*repeat 2X*}", "image": "https://images.genius.com/3b63864c76b254cbac7ffb7d3e83f789.600x600x1.jpg", "artist": "The Roots", "raw": {"annotation_count": 1,

played, what I'm about to say\nWill probably hit y'all niggas in a real strange way\nShmucks, ducks and half hearted prankster crews\nWillie dank Langston Hughes, put shanks in crews\nI debut to make the news and I've been killing it since\nStill in the trench, buzzin off the chillest suspense\nI want my niggas out that barbwire still in the fence\nVerbal assassin I'm a killer still in a sense\nRhymes is graphic\nAimin straight at your minds and blast that weak shit\nThe pieces and particles of fragments\nMad vocabulist, yes I must confess\nI'm like Diddy tryin to sink a slug in Elliots chest\nJust taste on that it's Black you can tell he a vet\nYou never knew that fate cut you until your belly was wet\nNew Delian cat the Fraggle Rock skully is split\nIt's Black coming, you can tell it's a hit\nComin to drop you nigga\n\nWe will Rock you {*repeat 6X*}\nYo yall savages is primitive, I'm true penmanship\nHere come the neuro-linguistic rap hypnotist\nMaking sound waves, prisoners outta the listeners\nLegendary magnificent dope distributors\nMan, I remain miles ahead of the game\nSlang play off the meter cause it's never the same\nNiggas tell me how they never comin better than plain\nThey love what I say, here come the rebel breaking the frame\nAnd the charts too, my earning bars arts is martial\nI'm comin to off you, I ain't tryin to argue\nWhen you least expect it I'm gonna step out the darkroom\nPull out the hardware tools the particles will spark you\nMy niggas wraps give a slice, I spit nice\nFucking around this twice as much as rhythm is rolling a dice\nTo choose one the noose or the gun\nCause you're getting banged or hanged, Thought second to none\nNigga\n\nYo check it out whether you ballin or just on the\nWall and groovin groovin\nWe've come to get it kickin and get the movement movin\nFor Tracey and Tamika and for Shelly and Susan\nStyles make you wonder what the hell he was usin\nRemember your development with melanin music\nSpit so many spears it's becoming a nuisance to some\nBut to whoever want to know who the truth is\nYou never heard another on the mic as ruthless\nI drink a little liquor a lot of water and juices\nIt make money ain't no need for makin excuses\nBurn you fuckin with a South Philly exclusive\nThem long dick niggas with real short fuses that go off\nChick likes Riq, you such a show off\nYou cut your locks down to a fro then cut your fro off\nI been at your show there ain't no way to cut your flow off\nYou got to be the illest emcee that people know of word\nI will rock you {*repeat 2X*}"}},

cup\nFucking you up\nHang over the banister\nYou feel the rush of the blood going straight to your brain\nAin't no love, you only love bringing hate to the game\nTaking my name in vain, mistaking license for freedom\nHe make music for the people, people dying to meet him\nPeople!\nWe still abuse it while the richest man in music\nHe probably driving a Buick and be rockin' Van Heusen\nG-U-E relevant, see how his man do it\nFucking with niggas from illa fifth, see how we ran through it\nThe river in the valley\nThe nigga in the alley\nRolling with the heat from BK to killer Cali\nThe hands will fake the clapping\nYou'll be collasping\nYou softer than Land-o-lakes\nTransforming the landscape\nLike a sandstorm in the Sahara\nI am the truest nigga\nI do more shows than The Roots to Carol Lewis\nCreative artist, never play the targets of game hunters\nYou may want to test this product like cane smugglers\nDis disco shit\nPopping like Crisco\nHitting your face\nSpit in your face like pistol shit\nMy style, wild like wipple whip\nI go back like a pistol grip\nIt's pro-black, Kweli!\n\n\nI\u2019m a threat like Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms\nWilly gank, spit the killer dank

gekko, this ain't got gold correct\nI'll fucking bounty hunt your body like I'm Boba Fett\nCause you a toy not a soldier yet\nYou better hold your neck\nYou dick smokers get no respect\nWith the blood, ice your watch, rock your rocks\nBetter rock it on the screen and not the blocks\nCuz them crews don't stop them shots\nIt's so many that fly, they chase down, I just stop and watch\nI'm from the south side of philly, it's known to get gruesome\nHeavy hitter villians these alleyways produce them\nHeavy hitter on a pocket we find a way to juice them\nThey may as well pay, schmuck\nIntroducing the B-to L-A see me the king splitter\nThen analyze this dime, the main thing glitter\nThen analyze the taste in your mouth, it seem bitter\nGanster, valedictorian, graduate of I dare you\nIf you are paper thin I'm a tear you\nI'm a come take care of you put a part in your hairdo\nYou barking like I'm a starting to scare you\nBut speak up like a man nigga so your body guards

with the permanent ink\nMr. Rourke on your Fantasy Island\nThe umbrella in your tropical drinks\nStill run it up it, liquor in your cup\nFucking you up\nHang over the banister\nYou feel the rush of the blood going straight to your brain\nAin't no love, you only love bringing hate to the game\nTaking my name in vain, mistaking license for freedom\nHe make music for the people, people dying to meet him\nPeople!\nWe still abuse it while the richest man in music\nHe probably driving a Buick and be rockin' Van Heusen\nG-U-E relevant, see how his man do it\nFucking with niggas from illa fifth, see how we ran through it\nThe river in the valley\nThe nigga in the alley\nRolling with the heat from BK to killer Cali\nThe hands will fake the clapping\nYou'll be collasping\nYou softer than Land-o-lakes\nTransforming the landscape\nLike a sandstorm in the Sahara\nI am the truest nigga\nI do more shows than The Roots to Carol Lewis\nCreative artist, never play the targets of game hunters\nYou may want to test this product like cane smugglers\nDis disco shit\nPopping like Crisco\nHitting your face\nSpit in your face like pistol shit\nMy style, wild like wipple whip\nI go back like a pistol grip\nIt's pro-black, Kweli!\n\n\nI\u2019m a threat like Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms\nWilly gank, spit the killer dank dialogue\nPyro-maniac like Dr. Molotov\nI knock the bottle off\nAnd knock the model off\nGots some non-believers here\nSome how I'll save y'all\nOr stop y'all worries, you makin me vexed\nHit up gekko, this ain't got gold correct\nI'll fucking bounty hunt your body like I'm Boba Fett\nCause you a toy not a soldier yet\nYou better hold your neck\nYou dick smokers get no respect\nWith the blood, ice your watch, rock your rocks\nBetter rock it on the screen and not the blocks\nCuz them crews don't stop them shots\nIt's so many that fly, they chase down, I just stop and watch\nI'm from the south side of philly, it's known to get gruesome\nHeavy hitter villians these alleyways produce them\nHeavy hitter on a pocket we find a way to juice them\nThey may as well pay, schmuck\nIntroducing the B-to L-A see me the king splitter\nThen analyze this dime, the main thing glitter\nThen analyze the taste in your mouth, it seem bitter\nGanster, valedictorian, graduate of I dare you\nIf you are paper thin I'm a tear you\nI'm a come take care of you put a part in your hairdo\nYou barking like I'm a starting to scare you\nBut speak up like a man nigga so your body guards can hear you"}}, {"title": "Roots and Aphillyation Unreleased", "album":

thunder\nWhen you from amongst us\nDig your boots, roll up the ? on your tomb\nGoing with shrooms, rhymes starin at the moon\nI set the sun in early afternoons\nSend out signals to get you back in tune\nAll light weight niggas will get vacuumed\n\nI hit this mid-life crisis ten years before thirty\nAnd stay in time, fuck fair ones, we fight dirty\nWe rally in the shadows of night and strike early\nWhile your sight blurry, the blind fury\nFifth cal-vary\nWe to the rescue\nThen rhyme battle like them crime battles depress too\nBullets in the wall of your chest too\nAnd plus whoever you standin next to\nThe ambu-lance will come and collect you\nI ripped you with the dart\nSect' true with the art\nIt's deeper than your classical Mozart\nYour pop or R&B charts\nCan never see Thought

October\nCombine minds will take you over even when it's cold out\nWhatever you say don't matter, disrespect and get splattered\nThe fact that you sunnin lotta niggas got me flattered\nWhen they heard it was me, they all scattered\nNotts Family love practice, we cock back for satisfaction\nPull on wear and bulletproofs is the fashion\nOn stings, we stackin\nAnd fifty raid the crib, we stil clappin\nWe tear the club up from state to state\nBouncin back to the bullet state, holdin the eight\nLike Onyx, we Shut Em Down\nWack crews, we lay em down\nWe all organizing, while you

attack competition I taught ya\nAny conflict I come equipped\nSwift with the riot spit\nMakin cats backflip from my vocals in this rap shit\nWhere fake rappers get capped shit\nFound in the dumpster with they cap's split\nDouble check, you shoulda packed it\nEmpty clips ain't never clapped shit\nRetaliation, you lacked it\nNow your back's against the wall, plastered\nDitto, this is that shit that

fight\nOne thousand MC's attack the mic\nNubians died and came back to life\nMost of ya'll ant to a gaint, so try me\nDon't you see the danger signs?\nNiggas I've dared slimy\nI give the chant and the youth fam a rain dance around me\nI make it storm and thunder\nWhen you from amongst us\nDig your boots, roll up the ? on your tomb\nGoing with shrooms, rhymes starin at the moon\nI set the sun in early afternoons\nSend out signals to get you back in tune\nAll light weight niggas will get vacuumed\n\nI hit this mid-life crisis ten years before thirty\nAnd stay in time, fuck fair ones, we fight dirty\nWe rally in the shadows of night and strike early\nWhile your sight blurry, the blind fury\nFifth cal-vary\nWe to the rescue\nThen rhyme battle like them crime battles depress too\nBullets in the wall of your chest too\nAnd plus whoever you standin next to\nThe ambu-lance will come and collect you\nI ripped you with the dart\nSect' true with the art\nIt's deeper than your classical Mozart\nYour pop or R&B charts\nCan never see Thought flows, is on some Philly shit\nMurder one penmanship, the uninnocent\nCul-prit, MC's is insulted\nAnd my affiliates/Aphillyates is high voltage\n\nI walk through the smog with the fog light on in the morning\nNo ? without warning, I'm brain storming\nSketch the blueprint, lookin through tinted to mutant\nCause disorderly nusiance with pollutants\nAdvance on your stance, incite a cobra in October\nCombine minds will take you over even when it's cold out\nWhatever you say don't matter, disrespect and get splattered\nThe fact that you sunnin lotta niggas got me flattered\nWhen they heard it was me, they all scattered\nNotts Family love practice, we cock back for satisfaction\nPull on wear and bulletproofs is the fashion\nOn stings, we stackin\nAnd fifty raid the crib, we stil clappin\nWe tear the club up from state to state\nBouncin back to the bullet state, holdin the eight\nLike Onyx, we Shut Em Down\nWack crews, we lay em down\nWe all organizing, while you idolizing\nAnd when the guns bust, it's the bullets that you can't trust\nKiss the barrel on your knees before I ripped you up\nAphillyation and The Roots, c'mon give it up\nWit these lyrics that'll hit you from your nuts up\nQuest the barber, last illest rhyme author\nIf I can't catch you, best believe my ill squad'll off ya\nWit the sparker, seven shot departure\nFive of those caught ya\nSneak attack competition I taught ya\nAny conflict I come equipped\nSwift with the riot spit\nMakin cats backflip from my vocals in this rap shit\nWhere fake rappers get capped shit\nFound in the dumpster with they cap's split\nDouble check, you shoulda packed it\nEmpty clips ain't never clapped shit\nRetaliation, you lacked it\nNow your back's against the wall, plastered\nDitto, this is that shit that got six fillin our vest\n?? fillin our chest, cuz when hell's lit, we the best\nYou ever heard in this shit, we spit degrees\nThat'll freeze, melt, and bring life to the shit\nYo like atoms we split, eye to eye we sit\nDeclare war within, defeatin war with men\nNow who can beat us\nWhen you was watered\nOur mens tore it down, start settin up shop\nIt's building blocks, now the cops can't stop what we got\nIt's too HOT\nLocals hassle niggas till they drop\nGet caught up in spots and what not\nBut we dead not\nCan't hit us with beams or Glocks\nI'm afraid not cuz all the above said and said not"}}, {"title": "Sacrifice", "album": "Phrenology", "year": "2002-11-26", "lyrics": "Listen, I got you phobic off of this like arachnids\nDrastic, it ain't plastic it's Pro-Blackness\nGrown man tactics, no pediatrics\nThe kind of track that make the comeback miraculous\nThe catalyst, Thought with the knack for splashin'\nI'm dashin' I mastered the craft of mashin'\nThe level-headed thoroughbred, the female's passion\nMag-netic attraction be keepin' them askin'\nThe crews in the Cadillacs with the Pendergrassin'\nSwerve half-naked, won't come near crashin'\nBut if I go to heaven, would y'all know my name\nOr would it be the same for you like I was Eric Clapton, huh?\nClap for you freedom dog, that's what's happening\nMy spit take critical political action\nThe hustle is a puzzle each piece is a fraction\nAnd every word that's understood is a transaction\nI'm an S.P. soldier, microphone holder\nRep Philly set from Bolivia to Boulder\nParis, France to 10th & Tioga\nHow we gonna make it through the dark, I show ya\n\nI tell you one lesson I learned\nIf you want to be something in life\nYou ain't gonna get it unless\nYou give a little bit of sacrifice\nOoohh, sometimes before you smile you got to cry\nYou need a heart that's filled with music\nIf you use it you can fly\nIf you want to be high\n\nListen, yo kick off your shoes, jump off the jock\nI fly higher than them dudes, from off your block\nMy name Black, the style is unorthodox\nIt tap chins in your mens 'til you thought could box\nA couple of people wanted Thought to stop, but guess what?\nMy man grab the missile, plug for the gut\nNow next time beatty stop being such a glut\nI'm precise with it like Faheim with haircuts\nWe up close on 'em with toast but no crust\nIt's fructose on 'em they froze and won't bust\nChoke on your face you jewels is lacklust\nGot to put it to you straight, y'all fools is jacked up\nCame close to the upmost but no cigar\nNose to the grindstone, head to the stars\nThe number one runner with the number one drummer\nGrammy award winnin' it's the world's eighth wonder\nCome on\n\n\nYour first impression might be I'm a asshole\nOr say I'm sometimey and give people a hassle\nOr try to suntouch and put the heat in the capsule\nDog I'm far deeper than that though; I get in the zone\nRecognize I'm a rolling stone\nNo time to lollygag or lounge with scaliwags\nGive me the disc or I put it where your body at\nOld school spit flow laid over Trotter tracks\nWith no apology fraud or trick-knowledgy\nJust trust, what I see and I say and follow me my way\nI read an open booklet inside me\nThe star of the story that groove teller got me\nThrough all the dark times part of the business\nThe light be contingent on small forensics\nMy microphone'll make a man a newborn infant\nIt's true so the crew gon' sense it\nI get in the zone\n\nThe fact of the matter is a matter of

Pro-Blackness\nGrown man tactics, no pediatrics\nThe kind of track that make the comeback miraculous\nThe catalyst, Thought with the knack for splashin'\nI'm dashin' I mastered the craft of mashin'\nThe level-headed throughbred, the female's passion\nMag-netic attraction be keepin' them askin'\nThe crews in the Cadillacs with the Pendergrassin'\nSwerve half-naked, won't come near crashin'\nBut if I go to heaven, would y'all know my name\nOr would it be the same for you like I was Eric Clapton, huh?\nClap for you freedom dog, that's what's happening\nMy spit take critical political action\nThe hustle is a puzzle each piece is a fraction\nAnd every word that's understood is a transaction\nI'm an S.P. soldier, microphone holder\nRep Philly set from Bolivia to Boulder\nParis, France to Tip and Tioga\nHow we gonna make it through the dark, I show ya\n(Chorus: Black Thought & Nelly Furtado)\nI tell you one lesson I learned\nIf you want to reach something in life\nYou ain't gonna get it unless\nYou give a little bit of sacrifice\nOoohh, sometimes before you smile you got to cry\nYou need a heart that's filled with music\nIf you use it you can fly\nIf you want to be high\n(Verse Two: Black Thought)\nListen, yo kick off your shoes, jump off the jock\nI fly higher than them dudes, from off your block\nMy name Black, the style is unorthodox\nIt tap chins in your mens 'til you thought could box\nA couple of people wanted Thought to stop, but guess what?\nMy man grab the missile, plug for the gut\nNow next time beatty stop being such a glut\nI'm precise with it like Faheim with haircuts\nWe up close on 'em with toast but no crust\nIt's fructose on 'em they froze and won't bust\nChoke on your face you jewels is lacklust\nGot to put it to you straight, y'all fools is jacked up\nCame close to the upmost but no cigar\nNose to the grindstone, head to the stars\nThe number one runner with the number one drummer\nGrammy award winnin' it's the world's eighth wonder\nCome on\n(Chorus)\n(Verse Three: Black Thought)\nYour first impression might be I'm a asshole\nOr say I'm sometimey and give people a hassle\nOr try to suntouch and put the heat in the capsule\nDog I'm far deeper than that though; I get in the zone\nRecognize I'm a rolling stone\nNo time to lollygag or lounge with scaliwags\nGive me the disc or I put it where your body at\nOld school spit flow laid over Trotter tracks\nWith no apology fraud or trick-knowledgy\nJust trust, what I see and I say and follow me my way\nI read an open booklet inside me\nThe star of the story that groove teller got me\nThrough all the dark times part of the business\nThe light be contingent on small forensics\nMy microphone'll make a man a newborn infant\nIt's true so the crew gon' sense it\nI get in the zone\n(Chorus x3)\nThe fact of the matter is a matter of fact...."}}, {"title": "Section", "album": "Illadelph Halflife", "year": null, "lyrics": " (x2)\nYou can't front, we comin' with the

repertoire\nThe lieutenant from the reservoir, serve the spar\nThe injurer, predator of a competitor\nI send MCs where the paramedics are\nAt first, I'm like \"nah\", I'm nonchalant from afar\nThen strike to cut the fake rap star jugular\nWith irregular balance of the cat burgalar\nKnown to parlay with Garcia Vega cigars\nI know the flavor because me and the thugs minds are mutual\nWe congruent, lay on the corner with the trauma unit\nI'm from the lab where the bomb's distributed\nSo never try to duplicate the skills executed\nSon you'd get electrocuted from the worldwide reputed\nShine like nickel heat that blow your mind when I shoot it\nSome know me as the man that's from the Roots crew\nOthers as the bad lieutenant of Snyder Avenue\nWe go an eye for an eye\nBehead like a samurai that'll command the dynasty until he die\nWho will imply that I lack ability?\nMake your words known, amplify the utility\nI'm crooked like the 'I' on a toxic malt liquor\nThe land whipper, the Dom Perignon champ sipper\nThe fifth'll bring it all together like the zipper on a butter leather\nThe bad lieu a bring the bad weather\nSo to whoever got riff, let it rest\nReflect, then recollect on the way it was set\nIt's the veteran architect that flows with the rhythm of sex\nBe on the low shotgun in the Lex\nWith my man low to flex\nI'm restin where they handle the Tecs\nAnd the lyrical vandal is next flow\nSo my man, my mizza, my man\nM-ilitant, what's the master plan?\nOnce again...\n\nYou can't front, we comin' with the shots to pump\nWe got more cuz it's what you want\nThump it in your

adverse is on your table, stabilize emotion\nA soldier at ease, but on post of up most in\nBrag and boast in my anecdotes that choke\nInvade your whole terrain, you feel the pain provoke\nWhen I breaststroke your wavelength of intensity\nMy alliance bring forth to you an entity\nYour whole vicinity, I contaminate with hate\nGot no time to debate, but hold up wait, sit straight\nIt\u2019s M-Il, the elicit, you violate, you get a ticket\nMCs you can't tell I expel, you get evicted\nFrom out your misery, serve your ass with my delivery\nAllah makes the ground you steppin on shivery\nPermanent tears run through your thoughts you queers\nIt's all upstairs, where there's a crowd, table and chairs\nFor years, been on the mic, I'm like a dike with stairs\nWhen I strike, I stay severe, niggas they lower their glare\nFrom over here my Range Rover sware to blast off socks\nSwitch the pitch from southpaw to unorthodox\nI shock your brain with the miscellaneous\nWho beez

are\nAt first, I'm like \"nah\", I'm nonchalant from afar\nThen strike to cut the fake rap star jugular\nWith irregular balance of the cat burgalar\nKnown to parlay with Garcia Vega cigars\nI know the flavor because me and the thugs minds are mutual\nWe congruent, lay on the corner with the trauma unit\nI'm from the lab where the bomb's distributed\nSo never try to duplicate the skills executed\nSon you'd get electrocuted from the worldwide reputed\nShine like nickel heat that blow your mind when I shoot it\nSome know me as the man that's from the Roots crew\nOthers as the bad lieutenant of Snyder Avenue\nWe go an eye for an eye\nBehead like a samurai that'll command the dynasty until he die\nWho will imply that I lack ability?\nMake your words known, amplify the utility\nI'm crooked like the 'I' on a toxic malt liquor\nThe land whipper, the Dom Perignon champ sipper\nThe fifth'll bring it all together like the zipper on a butter leather\nThe bad lieu a bring the bad weather\nSo to whoever got riff, let it rest\nReflect, then recollect on the way it was set\nIt's the veteran architect that flows with the rhythm of sex\nBe on the low shotgun in the Lex\nWith my man low to flex\nI'm restin where they handle the Tecs\nAnd the lyrical vandal is next flow\nSo my man, my mizza, my man\nM-ilitant, what's the master plan?\nOnce again...\n\nYou can't

contaminate with hate\nGot no time to debate, but hold up wait, sit straight\nIt\u2019s M-Il, the elicit, you violate, you get a ticket\nMCs you can't tell I expel, you get evicted\nFrom out your misery, serve your ass with my delivery\nAllah makes the ground you steppin on shivery\nPermanent tears run through your thoughts you queers\nIt's all upstairs, where there's a crowd, table and chairs\nFor years, been on the mic, I'm like a dike with stairs\nWhen I strike, I stay severe, niggas they lower their glare\nFrom over here my Range Rover sware to blast off socks\nSwitch the pitch

"lyrics": "Days are living fast, moves in misery\nYou got a song you wanna sing for me\nSing a song, singing man\nSing a song, singing man\nSing another song, singing man\nSing another song, singing man\nSing a song for me\nSing a song for me\n\nLook, I'm so twisted, so, so twisted\nOne life to live, and I'm willing to risk it\nTerror that the world has never known existed\nLeft so many clues, now how could they miss it?\nSadistic, ballistic, find a word and pick it\nLong as it means the world is on my shit list\nWalking time bomb, my mind is on tick-tick\nCountdown's on, its too late to nix it\nI'm so anxious, so, so anxious\nThe ones I hate barely know what my name is\nHave no clue that I'm armed and dangerous\nWilling to spill my blood to be famous\nWilling to spill my blood to make changes\nLook for a suicide note to explain this\nHeinous, inking the ache from my anguish\nSounds insane, you're speaking my language...\n\n\nOne for the pressing, two for the cross\nThree for the blessing, four for the loss\nKid holding a weapon, walk like a corpse\nIn the face of transgression, military issue Kalash-\n-Nikova or machete or a pitchfork\nHe killing cause he feel he got nothing to live for\nIn a war taking heads from men like Charles Taylor\nAnd never seen the undisclosed foreign arms dealer\n13-year-old killer, he look 35\nHe changed his name to Little No-Man-Survive\nWhen he smoke that leaf, shorty believe he can fly\nHe loot and terrorize and shoot between the eyes\nWho to blame, its a shame, the youth was demonized\nWishing he could see rearrange the truth, to see the lies\nAnd he wouldn't have to raise his barrel to target you\nHis heart can't give you the years of scar tissue...\n\n\nUh, what you're witnessing is true dedication\nCharged by the call and the cause of the nation\nCountdown, minutes away from detonation\nA lifetime of grunt work, this is the culmination\nMy manner, seems patient, inner rage lies\nSo deep, I can taste it, let's sacrifice lives\nPast the first sensation, to paradise I fly\nDelusions are lighting up the midday sky\nThe last days of mine spent in extreme secrecy\nWolves dressed like sheep occur more frequently\nToo much faith to be scared, the petrified both fled\nThose who live fearing death, might as well be dead\nTowers of the occupiers, will soon fall\nMartyr or mass murderer? That's your call\nMass transit or a mall? Who can watch them all?\nIn the name of the merciful, sing me a song..."}}, {"title": "Sleep", "album": "Undun", "year": "2011-12-02", "lyrics": "Like when autumn leaves fall\nDown from the trees\nThere goes my honey bee\n\nI\u2019ve lost a lot of sleep to dreams\nAnd I do not miss them yet\nI wouldn\u2019t wish them on the worst of enemies\nLet them burn, go from here\nLike when autumn leaves\n\nTo catch a thief, who stole the soul I prayed to keep\nInsomniac, bad dreams got me losing sleep\nI\u2019m dead tired, my mind playing tricks, deceit\nA face in the glass, unable to admit defeat\nAll that I am, all that I was is history\nThe past unraveled, adding insult to this injury\nI\u2019m fighting the battle for the soul of the century\nDestiny is everything that I pretend to be\nLook, and what I did came back to me eventually\nThe music played on, and told me I was meant to be awake\nIt\u2019s unresolved like everything I had at stake\nIllegal activity controls my black symphony\nOrchestrated like it happened incidentally\nOh, there I go, from a man to a memory\nDamn, I wonder if my fam will remember me\n\nI\u2019ve lost a lot of sleep to dreams\nAnd I do not miss them yet\nI wouldn\u2019t wish them on the worst of enemies\nLet them burn, go from here\nLike when autumn leaves", "image": "https://images.genius.com/bb007a34227e5b87c6581b2f3722077e.1000x1000x1.jpg", "artist": "The Roots", "raw": {"annotation_count": 15, "api_path": "/songs/58283", "description": {"dom": {"tag": "root", "children": [{"tag": "p", "children": ["\u201cSleep\u201d is first vocal track on the Roots' concept album ", {"tag": "em", "children": ["undun"]}, ".

catch a thief, who stole the soul I prayed to keep\nInsomniac, bad dreams got me losing sleep\nI\u2019m dead tired, my mind playing tricks, deceit\nA face in the glass, unable to admit defeat\nAll that I am, all that I was is history\nThe past unraveled, adding insult to this injury\nI\u2019m fighting the battle for the soul of the century\nDestiny is everything that I pretend to be\nLook, and what I did came back to me eventually\nThe music played on, and told me I was meant to be awake\nIt\u2019s unresolved like everything I had at stake\nIllegal activity controls my black symphony\nOrchestrated like it happened incidentally\nOh, there I go, from a man to a memory\nDamn, I wonder if my fam will remember me\n\nI\u2019ve lost a lot of sleep to dreams\nAnd I do not miss them yet\nI wouldn\u2019t wish them on the worst of enemies\nLet them burn, go from here\nLike when autumn leaves"}}, {"title": "Somebody's Gotta Do It", "album": "The Tipping Point", "year":

gotta do it\nSomebody's gotta come up with a plan\nAnd be there when the shit hits the fan\nI hope y'all out there understand\nLook man it's a fucked up job, but somebody's gotta do it\n\nYeah y'all, ideal for a lyrical perfectionist\nRaw, that's what every soldier in my collective is\nThought, control level is that of a gold medalist\nMy level headedness make it come off so effortless\nThe rebel is a opposite extreme of devilish\nBack setting it with the answer to your deficit\nMy track record is hot shit, consecutive\nSmug, I got game just like a record executive\nA kiss to the feminine girls loving a gentlemen\nA genius slash gangsta with a skill for swindling\nBet on Black\nBet these cats that's all gelatin\nWill fall back spittin' them raps that's unintelligent\nRaps that cap, rabid rattlin' out the gattlin'\nCrippling rhymes whistlin' past, blow you back in\nSmellin' your blood now I'm huntin'\nBlowin' your front in for frontin' what up cousin?\nOh, now it's nothin'\nYo, you can't go beyond a point of no returning\nI flip like my name Turner\nThat's for certain nigga, Ted Turner, Nat Turner, nigga Ike Turner\nThe raw sojourner for truth\nThe mic burner\n\n\nMic malevolence defies violence I inherited\nOthers just rentin' it like rooms at the Sheraton\nI gotta jones like Vanessa in the devil in-\nAnd y'all cold like a show in the Netherlands\nCold shoulders and frozen aortic valves -\nSo I don't form pals - conform to norms - morals different\nGifted - use it to shift shit a mutant shape shifter when I spit it I'm liquid\nYou could lick a million shots at the character of the body shell\nThey'll just richochette nigga aura's hard as hell\nBefore there was ain't hard to tell\nThe mic's cycle coincided right with mine as well\nSince a minor I walked with the spine upstraight\nI learned to rhyme to feed the dinner plate\nI scraped barrel - even dined up on wine and steaks\nCuz in the bone same marrow that apartheid chased\nThe narrow margin with the haves and the have nots\nWill get smaller as I approach - so watch your stash box\nFox logo if your fave is local\nGet bruised till you're the color of the Laker's logo\nThis is work niggas\n\n\nI made it - ain't nobody believe in me\nBut this rap game is like selling coke legally\nAin't no innovations - that takes concentration\nNigga's celebrating not knowing the time they wasting\nKillin' mics is one of my aesthetics\nRip very live so I'm an entertainer like Cedric\nShit they play on radio's now give me a headache\nCan't slow me down I know where I'm headed\nYour pride can only kill you, if you let it\nNigga's feeling energetic\nWanna rumble - guns will come out\nHere come the paramedics\nI'm just trying to live like I've Devin\nTired of my people failin'\nWe all sin - the devil, what di I tell em\nSomebody gotta get their hands dirty and shoes muddy\nI see things vividly, y'all vision is blurry\nEven if you hate - through my music you gone love\nEverybody with me and they was

when it gets bloody\nSomebody's gotta get their hands dirty\nYo, it's a fucked up job but somebody's gotta do it\nSomebody's gotta come up with a plan\nAnd be there when the shit hits the fan\nI hope y'all out there understand\nLook man it's a fucked up job, but somebody's gotta do it\n\nYeah y'all, ideal for a lyrical perfectionist\nRaw, that's what every soldier in my collective is\nThought, control level is that of a gold medalist\nMy level headedness make it come off so effortless\nThe rebel is a opposite extreme of devilish\nBack setting it with the answer to your deficit\nMy track record is hot shit, consecutive\nSmug, I got game just like a record executive\nA kiss to the feminine girls loving a gentlemen\nA genius slash gangsta with a skill for swindling\nBet on Black\nBet these cats that's all gelatin\nWill fall back spittin' them raps that's unintelligent\nRaps that cap, rabid rattlin' out the gattlin'\nCrippling rhymes whistlin' past, blow you back in\nSmellin' your blood now I'm huntin'\nBlowin' your front in for frontin' what up cousin?\nOh, now it's nothin'\nYo, you can't go beyond a point of no returning\nI flip like my name Turner\nThat's for certain nigga, Ted Turner, Nat Turner, nigga Ike Turner\nThe raw sojourner for truth\nThe mic burner\n\n\nMic malevolence defies violence I inherited\nOthers just rentin' it like rooms at the Sheraton\nI gotta jones like Vanessa in the devil in-\nAnd y'all cold like a show in the Netherlands\nCold shoulders and frozen aortic valves -\nSo I don't form pals - conform to norms - morals different\nGifted - use it to shift shit a mutant shape shifter when I spit it I'm liquid\nYou could lick a million shots at the character of the body shell\nThey'll just richochette nigga aura's hard as hell\nBefore there was ain't hard to tell\nThe mic's cycle coincided right with mine as well\nSince a minor I walked with the spine upstraight\nI learned to rhyme to feed the dinner plate\nI scraped barrel - even dined up on wine and steaks\nCuz in the bone same marrow that apartheid chased\nThe narrow margin with the haves and the have nots\nWill get smaller as I approach - so watch your stash box\nFox logo if your fave is local\nGet bruised till you're the color of the Laker's logo\nThis is work niggas\n\n\nI made it - ain't nobody believe in me\nBut this rap game is like selling coke legally\nAin't no innovations - that takes concentration\nNigga's celebrating not knowing the time they wasting\nKillin' mics is one of my aesthetics\nRip very live so I'm an entertainer like Cedric\nShit they play on radio's now give me a headache\nCan't slow me down I know where I'm headed\nYour pride can only kill you, if you let it\nNigga's feeling energetic\nWanna rumble - guns will come out\nHere come the paramedics\nI'm just trying to live like I've Devin\nTired of my people failin'\nWe all sin - the devil, what di I tell em\nSomebody gotta get their hands dirty and shoes muddy\nI see things vividly, y'all vision is blurry\nEven if you hate - through my music you gone love\nEverybody with me and they was with me when it was ugly"}}, {"title": "Something in the Way of Things (In Town)", "album": "Phrenology", "year": "2002-11-26", "lyrics": "In town\nIn town\nIn town\nSomething in the way of things\nSomething that will quit and won't start\nSomething you know but can't stand\nCan't know get along with, like death\nRiding on top of the car\nPeering through the windshield for his cue\nSomething entirely fictitious and true\nThat creeps across your path hallowing your evil ways\nLike they were yourself passing yourself not smiling\nThe dead guy you saw me talking to is your boss\nI tried to put a spell on him but his spirit is illiterate\nI know things you know and nothing you don't know\n'Cept I saw something in the way of things\nSomething grinning at me and I wanted to know, was it funny?\nWas it so funny it followed me down the street?\nGreeting everybody like the good humor man\nAnd they got the taste of good humor\nBut no ice cream\nIt was like that, me talking across people into the houses\nAnd not seeing the beings crowding around me with ice picks\nYou could see them\nBut they looked like important Negroes on the way to your funeral\nLooked like important jiggaboos on the way to your auction\nAnd let them chant the numbers\nAnd use an ivory pointer to count your teeth\nRemember Steppen Fetchit?\nRemember Steppen Fetchit, how we laughed?\nAnd all your Sunday school images giving flesh and jiggling\nWith the ice pick high off his head\nMade ya laugh, anyway\nI can see something in the way of ourselves\nI can see something in the way of ourselves\nThat's why I say the things I do\nYou know it, but it's something else to you\nLike that job\nThis morning, when you got there and it was quiet\nAnd the machines were yearning, soft, behind you\nYearning for their nigga to come and give up his life\nStandin' there bein' dissed and broke and troubled\nMy mistake is I kept sayin' \"that was proof God didn't exist\"\nAnd you told me, \"nah...\" Well, it's proof that the devil do\nBut still, it's like I see something I hear things\nI saw words in the white boy's lying rag\nSaid he was gonna die poor and frustrated\nThat them dreams walk witch you 'cross town\nS'gonna die from over work\nThere's garbage on the street that's tellin' you you ain't shit\nAnd you almost believe it\nBroke and mistaken all the time\nYou know some of the words, but they ain't the right ones\nYour cable back on but ain't nothin' you can see\nBut I see something in the way of things\nSomething to make us stumble\nSomething to get us drunk from noise and addicted to sadness\nI see something and feel something, stalking us\nLike an ugly thing floating at our back, calling us names\nYou see it and hear it too\nBut you say, \"It got a right to exist just like you\nAnd if God made it...\" But then we got to arguin'\nAnd the light gon' come down around us\nEven though we remember where the mic is\nRemember the Negro squinting at us through the cage\nYou seen what I see too?\nThe smile that ain't a smile but teeth flying against our necks\nYou see something too, but can't call its name\n\"Ain't it too bad?\" y'all said\n\"Ain't it too bad? Such a nice boy, always kind to his mother\nAlways said good morning to everybody on his way to work\"\nBut that last time before he got locked up and hurt, real bad\nI seen him walkin' toward his house and he wasn't smiling\nAnd he didn't even say hello\nBut I knew he'd seen something\nSomething in the way of things\nThat it worked on him like it do in will\nAnd he kept marching faster and faster away from us\nAnd never even muttered a word\nThen the next day he was gone\nYou wanna know what?\nYou wanna know what I'm talkin' about?\nSayin' \"I seen something in the way of things\"\nAnd how the boy's face looked that day\nJust before they took him away\nThe is in that face and remember now\nRemember all them other faces\nAnd all the many places you've seen 'em\nOr the sister with his child\nWandering up the street\nRemember what you seen in your own mirror\nAnd didn't for a second recognize\nThe face, your own face\nStraining to get out from behind the glass\nOpen your mouth like you was gon' say somethin'\nClose your eyes and remember what you saw\nAnd what it made you feel like\nNow, don't you see something else?\nSomething cold and ugly\nNot invisible but blended with the shadow\nCriss-crossing the old man\nSquatting by the drug store at the corner\nWith his head resting uneasily on his folded arms\nAnd the boy that smiled and the girl he went with\nAnd in my eyes too\nA waving craziness splitting them\nInto the jet stream of a black bird\nWith his ass on fire\nOr the solemn not-ness of where we go\nTo know we gon' be happy\nI seen something!\nI SEEN something!\nAnd you seen it too!\nYou seen it too!\nYou just can't call its name...", "image": "https://images.genius.com/3b63864c76b254cbac7ffb7d3e83f789.600x600x1.jpg", "artist": "The Roots", "raw":

won't start\nSomething you know but can't stand\nCan't know get along with, like death\nRiding on top of the car\nPeering through the windshield for his cue\nSomething entirely fictitious and true\nThat creeps across your path hallowing your evil ways\nLike they were yourself passing yourself not smiling\nThe dead guy you saw me talking to is your boss\nI tried to put a spell on him but his spirit is illiterate\nI know things you know and nothing you don't know\n'Cept I saw something in the way of things\nSomething grinning at me and I wanted to know, was it funny?\nWas it so funny it followed me down the street?\nGreeting everybody like the good humor man\nAnd they got the taste of good humor\nBut no ice cream\nIt was like that, me talking across people into the houses\nAnd not seeing the beings crowding around me with ice picks\nYou could see them\nBut they looked like important Negroes on the way to your funeral\nLooked like important jiggaboos on the way to your auction\nAnd let them chant the numbers\nAnd use an ivory pointer to count your teeth\nRemember Steppen Fetchit?\nRemember Steppen Fetchit, how we laughed?\nAnd all your Sunday school images giving flesh and jiggling\nWith the ice pick high off his head\nMade ya laugh, anyway\nI can see something in the way of ourselves\nI can see something in the way of ourselves\nThat's why I say the things I do\nYou know it, but it's something else to you\nLike that job\nThis morning, when you got there and it was quiet\nAnd the machines were yearning, soft, behind you\nYearning for their nigga to come and give up his life\nStandin' there bein' dissed and broke and troubled\nMy mistake is I kept sayin' \"that was proof God didn't exist\"\nAnd you told me, \"nah...\" Well, it's proof that the devil do\nBut still, it's like I see something I hear things\nI saw words in the white boy's lying rag\nSaid he was gonna die poor and frustrated\nThat them dreams walk witch you 'cross town\nS'gonna die from over work\nThere's garbage on the street that's tellin' you you ain't shit\nAnd you almost believe it\nBroke and mistaken all the time\nYou know some of the words, but they ain't the right ones\nYour cable back on but ain't nothin' you can see\nBut I see something in the way of things\nSomething to make us stumble\nSomething to get us drunk from noise and addicted to sadness\nI see something and feel something, stalking us\nLike an ugly thing floating at our back, calling us names\nYou see it and hear it too\nBut you say, \"It got a right to exist just like you\nAnd if God made it...\" But then we got to arguin'\nAnd the light gon' come down around us\nEven though we remember where the mic is\nRemember the Negro squinting at us through the cage\nYou seen what I see too?\nThe smile that ain't a smile but teeth flying against our necks\nYou see something too, but can't call its name\n\"Ain't it too bad?\" y'all said\n\"Ain't it too bad? Such a nice boy, always kind to his mother\nAlways said good morning to everybody on his way to work\"\nBut that last time before he got locked up and hurt, real bad\nI seen him walkin' toward his house and he wasn't smiling\nAnd he didn't even say hello\nBut I knew he'd seen something\nSomething in the way of things\nThat it worked on him like it do in will\nAnd he kept marching faster and faster away from us\nAnd never even muttered a word\nThen the next day he was gone\nYou wanna know what?\nYou wanna know what I'm talkin' about?\nSayin' \"I seen something in the way of things\"\nAnd how the boy's face looked that day\nJust before they took him away\nThe is in that face and remember now\nRemember all them other faces\nAnd all the many places you've seen 'em\nOr the sister with his child\nWandering up the street\nRemember what you seen in your own mirror\nAnd didn't for a second recognize\nThe face, your own face\nStraining to get out from behind the glass\nOpen your mouth like you was gon' say somethin'\nClose your eyes and remember what you saw\nAnd what it made you feel like\nNow, don't you see something else?\nSomething cold and ugly\nNot invisible but blended with the shadow\nCriss-crossing the old man\nSquatting by the drug store at the corner\nWith his head resting uneasily on his folded arms\nAnd the boy that smiled and the girl he went with\nAnd in my eyes too\nA waving craziness splitting them\nInto the jet stream of a black bird\nWith his ass on fire\nOr the solemn not-ness of where we go\nTo know we gon' be happy\nI seen something!\nI SEEN something!\nAnd you seen it too!\nYou seen it too!\nYou just can't call its name..."}}, {"title": "Star", "album": null, "year": null, "lyrics": "Get 'em up high, okay, yeah\nGo all-star, and get down for yours\nTo the ladies in the house, be proud of yours\nYou got the Roots crew with the sound of course\nHigh, lift 'em up high, okay\nWhen that adrenaline get in they system\nIt get 'em out on a quest for stardom, could be a motherfuckin' problem\nIn Philly, Cincinatti, Los Angeles or Harlem\nKids call theyself killers let they hammers do the talkin'\nDon't even know the meaning of life, ain't seen a thing\nAnd you dream of floodin' the scenery with, llello and greenery\nBut for now, you stickin' her with the heavy machinery\nWonder how, you lift it up, be only 17\nAnd like e'rybody he wanna shine, young brother's on the grind\nHoldin' somethin' in they spine, \"Bowling for Columbine\"\nStressin' to me how it's all about a dollar sign\nDig the way you out of line, out of sight and out of mind\nUp against the clock and damn near out of time\n\"The Tipping Point\" has arrived, and that's the bottom line\nTo all my peoples that's stars, it's our time to shine\nLet's get 'em up high, c'mon\nGo all-star, and get down for yours\nTo the ladies in the house, be proud of yours\nYou got the Roots crew with the sound of course\nHigh, lift 'em up high, okay\nGo all-star, and get down for yours\nTo the ladies in the house, be proud of yours\nYou got the Roots crew with the sound of course\nHigh, lift 'em up high, okay\nYo, ain't it strange how the newspapers play with the language\nI'm deprogrammin' y'all with uncut slang shit\nI know some peoples in the party armed and dangerous\nTwist some cool champagne, I'm goin' through changes\nA grown-ass man, I done paid my dues\nLearn the rules, lil' homey, you could be one, too\nNiggas know, ain't no tellin' what he gon' do\nBut recognize, young bruh, I'ma do it for you\nYou know why?

problem\nIn Philly, Cincinatti, Los Angeles or Harlem\nKids call theyself killers let they hammers do the talkin'\nDon't even know the meaning of life, ain't seen a thing\nAnd you dream of floodin' the scenery with, llello and greenery\nBut for now, you stickin' her with the heavy machinery\nWonder how, you lift it up, be only 17\nAnd like e'rybody he wanna shine, young brother's on the grind\nHoldin' somethin' in they spine, \"Bowling for Columbine\"\nStressin' to me how it's all about a dollar sign\nDig the way you out of line, out of sight and out of mind\nUp against the clock and damn near out of time\n\"The Tipping Point\" has arrived, and that's the bottom line\nTo all my peoples that's stars, it's our time to shine\nLet's get 'em up high, c'mon\nGo all-star, and get down

uncut slang shit\nI know some peoples in the party armed and dangerous\nTwist some cool champagne, I'm goin' through changes\nA grown-ass man, I done paid my dues\nLearn the rules, lil' homey, you could be one, too\nNiggas know, ain't no tellin' what he gon' do\nBut recognize, young bruh, I'ma do it for you\nYou know why? We all stars and we highly evolved\nHip-Hop, it's not pop like Kylie Minogue\nIf it bang, them gettin'-busy brothers probably involved\nIn the game, where e'rybody got a shottie to draw\nI guess you probably a thug, you boss ballin' or what?\nI can't call it, man, I got the ladies fallin' in love\n'Cause handsome, intelligent, tough, I'm all the above\nI know you knew it it's the movement\nGroove to it while you doin' it up\nGo all-star, and get down for yours\nTo the ladies in the house, be proud of yours\nYou got the Roots crew with the sound of course\nHigh, lift 'em up high, c'mon\nGo all-star, and get down for yours\nTo the ladies in the house, be proud of yours\nYou got the Roots crew the sound of course\nHigh, lift 'em up high, c'mon\nIntroducin' the band you gotta see to believe\nHe got the mic in his hand, so keep the heat up your sleeve\nIt's Black Thought, he rockin' sharp so the speakers'll bleed\nI run a triathalon, you wouldn't see me fatigued\nI'm a star, and maybe y'all should cop somethin' to be\nOr trade some of y'all equipment in for somethin' you need\n'Cause it's a lot of bullshit floodin' the scene\nWhere e'rybody's a star, and hot shit is few and far between\nWe lose the grip of what garbage mean\nShorties wanna be theyself, I know it's hard to be\nDon't wanna do the Ruben Studdard and come off less threatenin'\nKeepin' it real'll kill you if you end up lettin' it\nAin't it blowin' your mind how the game all in line\nNow the best, to the rest, we fin' to end up settin' it\nI'd tell you that I was a veteran, but it's evident\nYou act like you want it, you gon' end up gettin' it\nGo all-star, and get down for yours\nTo the ladies in the house, be proud of yours\nYou got the Roots crew with the sound of course\nHigh, lift 'em up high, c'mon\nGo all-star, and get down for yours\nTo the ladies in the house, be proud of yours\nYou got the Roots crew the sound of course\nHigh, lift 'em up high, ok\nGo all-star, and get down for yours\nTo the ladies in the house, be proud of yours\nYou got the Roots crew with the sound of course\nHigh, lift 'em up high, c'mon"}}, {"title": "Stay Cool", "album": "The Tipping Point", "year": "2004-07-13", "lyrics": "Bass for your face, highs for your eyes\nDon't blink, Black Ink has arrived, all rise\nRude boys keep that thing at your side, be alright\nMuh'fuckers Philly we up in here, we all live\nI'm puffin this Cohiba mami coolin her heels\nAll she ever seem to do is play it cool f'real\nShe be pushin, Pop's vessel, and his shoe's is ill\nBut her hand, keep slippin on the woodgrain wheel\nBut it's cool, we never slippin when it's moves to make\nEspecially when what we talkin ain't ya usual cake\nI pump bass for y'all bathin apes, to get charged\nNah, I'm not a dealer, I'm a poet at large\nWe in the wind with the roof back, lettin the breeze hit us\nThe bathrobe on with sweatpants and slippers\nComin to pay a visit to whoever on the hitlist\nSome of y'all been tryin for years, you'll never get this fool\nCheck it out (stay cool) stay cool daddy (stay cool)\nStay cool ma (hey, hey) c'mon\n(Stay cool motherfuckers y'all know the rules)\n(Hey, stay cool.. stay cool)\nThere it is (Yeah hah hah, stay coooool)\n\nHip-Hop my main bitch, I got a few on the side\nThe game stitched yo I'm doin my job\nGo up against enormous odds\nWouldn't break a sweat, money make a bet\nFunny son you threat, well I ain't shakin yet\nTwenty-fo'/sev' chillin, tougher than penicillin\nFrom the block where the crooked cops killin like a villain\nChildren, in the hood gettin rocked by they buildings\nAnd brothers, 'cross the board gettin knocked by the millions\nThe stress, got me ignitin the potent marijuana leaf\nTryin to play it cooler than a polar bear colony\nYou feel the music know I'm over there probably\nPimpin on the same system that forever shorted me\nI got the soul of a young Sam Cooke when I spit\nIt make you wanna make a new dance up\nIt's all to the good shorty 'gwan do that stuff\nIt's not another sound system rockin steady as us\nAnd it's cool\n(Stay cool) yeah (stay cool) stay cool ha\n(Hey, hey) check it out, and just\n(Stay cool motherfuckers y'all know the rules) yeah\n(Hey, stay cool.. stay cool)\n(Yeah hah hah, stay coooool)\n\nYeah, when I'm crusin in my vehicle, the Jakes harass me\nThey never ride past me, they really comin at me right\nThey wanna know where the drugs guns and cash be\nProbably wanna get me to run, so they can blast me\nJust, blast me in your box, play my shit\nI know it's crowded at the top, cause I'm on the tip\nAnd that's as high up at the top, as a brother could get\nAnd how I do it make a lot of muh'fuckers upset\nBut it's fine, Riq Jizzle I'm back for mine\nIn case y'all gettin tired of the same ol' shine\nAnd I'm calm, calculated and perfectly aligned\nThe way I'm operatin what is it?

puffin this Cohiba mami coolin her heels\nAll she ever seem to do is play it cool f'real\nShe be pushin, Pop's vessel, and his shoe's is ill\nBut her hand, keep slippin on the woodgrain wheel\nBut it's cool, we never slippin when it's moves to make\nEspecially when what we talkin ain't ya usual cake\nI pump bass for y'all bathin apes, to get charged\nNah, I'm not a dealer, I'm a poet at large\nWe in the wind with the roof back, lettin the breeze hit us\nThe bathrobe on with sweatpants and slippers\nComin to pay a visit to whoever on the hitlist\nSome of y'all been tryin for years, you'll never get this fool\nCheck it out (stay cool) stay cool daddy (stay cool)\nStay cool ma (hey, hey) c'mon\n(Stay cool motherfuckers y'all know the rules)\n(Hey, stay cool.. stay cool)\nThere it is (Yeah hah hah, stay coooool)\n\nHip-Hop my main bitch, I got a few on the side\nThe game stitched yo I'm doin my job\nGo up against enormous odds\nWouldn't break a sweat, money make a bet\nFunny son you threat, well I ain't shakin yet\nTwenty-fo'/sev' chillin, tougher than penicillin\nFrom the block where the crooked cops killin like a villain\nChildren, in the hood gettin rocked by they buildings\nAnd brothers, 'cross the board gettin knocked by the millions\nThe stress, got me ignitin the potent marijuana leaf\nTryin to play it cooler than a polar bear colony\nYou feel the music know I'm over there probably\nPimpin on the same system that forever shorted me\nI got the soul of a young Sam Cooke when I spit\nIt make you wanna make a new dance up\nIt's all to the good shorty 'gwan do that stuff\nIt's not another sound system rockin steady as us\nAnd it's cool\n(Stay cool) yeah (stay cool) stay cool ha\n(Hey, hey) check it out, and just\n(Stay cool motherfuckers y'all know the rules) yeah\n(Hey, stay cool.. stay cool)\n(Yeah hah hah, stay coooool)\n\nYeah, when I'm crusin in my vehicle, the Jakes harass me\nThey never ride past me, they really comin at me right\nThey wanna know where the drugs guns and cash be\nProbably wanna get me to run, so they can blast me\nJust, blast me in your box, play my shit\nI know it's crowded at the top, cause I'm on the tip\nAnd that's as high up at the top, as a brother could get\nAnd how I do it make a lot of muh'fuckers upset\nBut it's fine, Riq Jizzle I'm back for mine\nIn case y'all gettin tired of the same ol' shine\nAnd I'm calm, calculated and perfectly aligned\nThe way I'm operatin what is it? surgery in rhyme\nIt's not a thang when I lower the gradient lens frames\nI'm cooler than Clyde Stubblefield, drummer for James\nHip-Hop is out of Hustleville, comin for change\nI exercise 'til a muscle build, breakin the chains\nAnd It's cool\n(Stay cool) (stay cool) (hey, hey)\n(Stay cool motherfuckers

world that's deceptive\nBeats are perfected, the ghetto's infested\nWith more destruction, my vocal eruption\nWas speaking bout corruption with no introduction\nApproach me with caution cause I spark losses\nM-Illitant the rap arson, marchin'\nLeaving niggas stiff like I'm starchin', departin'\nHollywood Sambos and jokes just like Martin\nI'm the type of nigga that belong in a war\nWith a mic and a cord, to hold your head with a sword\nSelf-proclaimed lames, calling theyselves bold\nThey shall be floored when the claps applaud\nAt this point of life when I can\u2019t afford\nThen I have to get sheist and I deal in fraud\nNow back to the topic of the rap philosopher\nWith more drama than a soap opera\nWho stops the propaganda, the hot block commander\nPutting a halt to all the backtalk and slander\nWarn every challenger about the silencer\nMuzzle in your mouth for the days that's on the calendar\n\nStep into the realm, you're bound to get caught\nAnd from this worldly life you'll soon

red faces of stone\nEyes are crevices, life like a double negative\nPhilly criminal, I rhyme my dirt, Tariq already did\nBuilding this Fifth foundation in the wilderness\nThought-less, trespass and enter Thought's fortress\nLimitless interest, paid to the order of the\nCypher slaughterer, my mic slapping you senseless\nDefenseless, niggas never moving me inches\nThe beat Fifth, invisi-ble in the trenches\nAficianado, awesome hip-hop drug problem\nFuck stardom, and chickens up in Gotham\nPoltergeist, slit or choke the mic 'til it scream to me\nStop that, cash we conveniently got that\nI stroll through your scenery cocked back\nMe and Hot Mack, the '98, El Dorado Cadillac Jacks\n\nStep into the realm, you're bound to get caught\nAnd from this worldly life you'll soon depart\nStep into the

you'll soon depart\nStep into the realm, you're bound to get caught\nAnd from this worldly life you'll soon depart\nStep into the realm, you're bound to get caught\nAnd from this worldly life you'll soon depart\nStep into the realm, you're bound to get caught\nAnd from this worldly life you'll soon depart\n\nYo, I walk across this world that's deceptive\nBeats are perfected, the ghetto's infested\nWith more destruction, my vocal eruption\nWas speaking bout corruption with no introduction\nApproach me with caution cause I spark losses\nM-Illitant the rap arson, marchin'\nLeaving niggas stiff like I'm starchin', departin'\nHollywood Sambos and jokes just like Martin\nI'm the type of nigga that belong in a war\nWith a mic and a cord, to hold your head with a sword\nSelf-proclaimed lames, calling theyselves bold\nThey shall be floored when the claps applaud\nAt this point of life when I can\u2019t afford\nThen I have to get sheist and I deal in fraud\nNow back to the topic of the rap philosopher\nWith more drama than a soap opera\nWho stops the propaganda, the hot block commander\nPutting a halt to all the backtalk and slander\nWarn every challenger about the silencer\nMuzzle in your mouth for the days that's on the calendar\n\nStep into the realm, you're bound to get caught\nAnd from this worldly life you'll soon depart\nStep into the realm, you're bound to get caught\nAnd from this worldly life you'll soon depart\nStep into the realm, you're bound to get caught\nAnd from this worldly life you'll soon depart\nStep into the realm, you're bound to get caught\nAnd from this worldly life you'll soon depart\n\nI'm from the valley of the heavy-heads\nWatch the ghetto pre-medical\nUndergrads and steady red faces of stone\nEyes are crevices, life like a double negative\nPhilly criminal, I rhyme my dirt, Tariq already did\nBuilding this Fifth foundation in the wilderness\nThought-less, trespass and enter Thought's fortress\nLimitless interest, paid to the order of the\nCypher slaughterer, my mic slapping you senseless\nDefenseless, niggas never moving me inches\nThe beat Fifth, invisi-ble in the trenches\nAficianado, awesome hip-hop drug problem\nFuck stardom, and chickens up in Gotham\nPoltergeist, slit or choke the mic 'til it scream to me\nStop that, cash we conveniently got that\nI stroll through your scenery cocked back\nMe and Hot Mack, the '98, El Dorado Cadillac Jacks\n\nStep into the realm, you're bound to get caught\nAnd from this worldly life you'll soon depart\nStep into the realm, you're bound to get caught\nAnd from this worldly life you'll soon depart\nStep into the realm, you're bound to get caught\nAnd from this worldly life you'll soon depart\nStep into the realm, you're bound to get caught\nAnd from this worldly life you'll soon depart"}}, {"title": "Stomp", "album": "Undun", "year": "2011-12-02", "lyrics": "It\u2019s about flesh and blood\nIt\u2019s about heart beat that beats strong\nIt\u2019s about

of my hand\nIt reads like a final letter I\u2019m leaving for my fam but\nIt\u2019s written in language they will never understand\nA late repentant\nNever deviating from a plan\nI drive by headed for the valley of the damned\nThe Wheels spin, I\u2019m looking for a sacrificial lamb\nThen roll tactics like a soldier out in the Sudan\nListen\u2026\nWas this a matter of flesh and blood\nYes it was\nDoes it matter who win and lose\nYes it does\nIt ain\u2019t about the most blessed love\nWhen you return to the essence\nWhat is it back to the essence of?\nGreatness I wasn't in the presence of\nCause you was fake and never measured up\nYou just a nigga on his regular\nBut how far am I ahead of ya\nIt just as easily coulda been me instead of ya\n\nWe gon\u2019 fight till we can\u2019t fight no more\nAnd when we can\u2019t fight no more\nWe gon\u2019 lie down and bleed a while\nWe gon\u2019 get up\nAnd fight some more\nWant you say it with me\nRepeat it after me when I say it\nWe gon\u2019 fight\n\nFuck getting fucked\nImmaculate conception\nNow what\u2019s beef ain\u2019t even a question\nCalico kisses, cold blood and crime tape\nFlirt with death, every night it\u2019s a blind date\nOne night stand, payback's a bitch\nShit have you skinny dipping in a pool of your piss\nBlood, sweat, and tears, broken teeth and spit\nPut the barrel in your mouth\nBlow the devil a kiss\nPut the knife in ya back cut down to the red meat\nDaddy should\u2019ve let me be a stain on the bed sheets\nI\u2019m one shot short of a Molotov cocktail\nKick in the door like welcome to my world\nI\u2019m an evil genius when it comes to this dumb shit\nHalf of the time I'mma keep it one hundred\nDon\u2019t play chicken when I\u2019m driving them crazy\nGet hit in the wing thigh breast

devil a kiss\nPut the knife in ya back cut down to the red meat\nDaddy should\u2019ve let me be a stain on the bed sheets\nI\u2019m one shot short of a Molotov cocktail\nKick in the door like welcome to my world\nI\u2019m an evil genius when it comes to this dumb shit\nHalf of the time I'mma keep it one hundred\nDon\u2019t play chicken when I\u2019m driving them crazy\nGet hit in the wing thigh

sways, and like a sorceress I slays\nFoes and ri-vals, who wanna come\nThis way, they better pay attention\nOr a penchant, not to mention, suspension\nFrom the microphone, plus, detention\nTrey-eight-o's will vacate those\nIf there's drama with my henchmen\nSo, lamp to my man Mussolini\nGo get your whole staff, those decaf\nCause half-and-half's couldn't cream me\nThe lyrics make your head knock\nMalik B and Black Thought, the dreadlock\nMannn, transss-gressin\nYou'll catch lead I, crushing\nPounding on the drums like King Kong\nWe can ring your bellll, ding-dong\nI styles with my vocabulary\nThe Roots, the one you call your ultra adversary\nNow, you're all desert cause I'mma serve ya like a tray\nTo meet your doom, Malik's the broom, so you get swept awayyyy\n\nMC's who slept for days, must be swept away\nMC's who slept for days, must be swept away\nMC's who slept for days, must be swept away\nMC's who slept for days, must be swept away\n\nYo, hello everybody, do I need introduct?\nI be the mic mercenary, very un-clear\nTo your ear, the exquisite pattern that you hear\nIt's known to be Black Butta Baby\nCrazy cardiac, my attack on any fat rhythm\nThat I capture, kid, I snatch the mic from tykes\nWhile I proceed and continue to tend to\nBusiness, cause this is, how I do\nI'm insane, and go against the grain like freight\nNever on no nigga dick, cause I'm just too hip\nPlus, I rest where niggas pack and never act\nOther than ill, shit is real in Phy-double\nSo if you want trouble let's stomp, my mission is to flip on comp\nYou might aspire to be flyer than I, you must pay\nYour dues, while I bruise niggas new for the day\nShall be swept away\n\nMC's who slept for days, must be swept away\nMC's who slept for days, must be swept away\nMC's who slept for days, must be swept away\nMC's who slept for days, must be swept away\n\nThere's something going on\nBecause there's something going on, on\nYeah, something's goin on\nYeah, something's going on, on\nY'all know there's something going\nBecause there's something going on, on\nShe knows there's something going on\nYeah, something going on, on\nY'all know there's

life I learned to ?miss amend?\nPeep the structure of a whole empire\nSmuggled sealed tai, pack lyrics like Kya\nVerbal messiah, when I cross I set a fire\nWhack your MC for ten thou' cause I'm for hire"}}, {"title": "Take it There", "album": "Game Theory", "year": "2006-08-29", "lyrics": "Stand up, stretch for the stars\nGet somebody else involved right next to ya\nY'all elected me to keep it so fresh for ya\nJust cause I make it possible for the rest of ya\nTo just take it there come on and\nGet your head ringin' from the sting of the snare\nSpine tingle elevating every singular hair\nAll the way from South Philly on a wing and prayer\nAnd still bringin' it yeah\n\nC'mon take it there\nC'mon take it there\nLet's take it there\nC'mon take it there\nI'm from the side of town\nWhere shots get sprayed around\nWhere the expectancy rate be twenty-eight around\nDowntown battleground where cops parade around\nHave your whole view of life beyond jaded\nHow everybody sick of breaking down, tryin' a make it out\nHand over fist the only way to get the paper down\nPeople tired of gettin' pushed around, gettin' gangsta now\nDiscipline the only way to bring some kinda change around\nChain cirgarette smokin' with bad nerves\nAnd brothas with bad lungs from smokin' mad herb\nWhoever in the dark is unseen and heard\nLet's emerge, I can feel something close we on the verge\nTalkin' bout, to my street sweepers, hotel housekeepers\nAnd my people spillin' this out through jail house speakers\nSome people rather use they mics than use heaters\nSome people rather lose they life than lose freedom\nFor real\n\n(poem interlude)\nSociety's time bomb laying dormant\nOur people disenfranchised from the free world\nOil for food but they still hungry\nNo democracy\nThey said one vote equals one voice\nBut he told you if he can't work to make it\nHe'll rob to take it\nThe villains\nAbandoning the planet and the people\nAnother hot summer yo, they 'bout to flood the prisons\nThis ain't no do diddley, it's a do somethin'\n\nFlash light, red light, proceed ahead right\nStraight into them headlights, you get your head right\nHead right get a third strike, hit the turnpike\nLife quicker than spliff that wouldn't burn right\nMake you wanna holla 'bout it\nIt ain't no doubt about it\nEvery now and then you gotta stand up and shout about it\nAnd I'll be shoutin' it to, as if a shout'll count\nYo they got accountin' to do, reamount the balance\nThe shit more puzzlin' than a jigsaw\nRaw pitbulls hustlin' through the pitfalls\nSome of y'all toys let the laughter rip roar\nHeart felt truth in every lyric I spit forth\nRaise up time to lift off\nWritten on a legal pad, poetry that sizzle the clip board\nMy og, my homey who taught me deal\nSaid in prayer that's the only time you should ever kneel\nAnd that's real, I'm a take it there", "image": "https://images.genius.com/e1df5a47164b92136a7e28ca98ef2314.1000x1000x1.jpg", "artist": "The Roots", "raw": {"annotation_count": 18,

elected me to keep it so fresh for ya\nJust cause I make it possible for the rest of ya\nTo just take it there come on and\nGet your head ringin' from the sting of the snare\nSpine tingle elevating every singular hair\nAll the way from South Philly on a wing and prayer\nAnd still bringin' it yeah\n\nC'mon take it there\nC'mon take it there\nLet's take it there\nC'mon take it there\nI'm from the side of town\nWhere shots get sprayed around\nWhere the expectancy rate be twenty-eight around\nDowntown battleground where cops parade around\nHave your whole view of life beyond jaded\nHow everybody sick of breaking down, tryin' a make it out\nHand over fist the only way to get the paper down\nPeople tired of gettin' pushed around, gettin' gangsta now\nDiscipline the only way to bring some kinda change around\nChain cirgarette smokin' with bad nerves\nAnd brothas with bad lungs from smokin' mad herb\nWhoever in the dark is unseen and heard\nLet's emerge, I can feel something close we on the verge\nTalkin' bout, to my street sweepers, hotel housekeepers\nAnd my people spillin' this out through jail house speakers\nSome people rather use they mics than use heaters\nSome people rather lose they life than lose freedom\nFor real\n\n(poem interlude)\nSociety's time bomb laying dormant\nOur people disenfranchised from the free world\nOil for food but they still hungry\nNo democracy\nThey said one vote equals one voice\nBut he told you if he can't work to make it\nHe'll rob to take it\nThe villains\nAbandoning the planet and the people\nAnother hot summer yo, they 'bout to flood the prisons\nThis ain't no do diddley, it's a do somethin'\n\nFlash light, red light, proceed ahead right\nStraight into them headlights, you get your head right\nHead right get a third strike, hit the turnpike\nLife quicker than spliff that wouldn't burn right\nMake you wanna holla 'bout it\nIt ain't no doubt about it\nEvery now and then you gotta stand up and shout about it\nAnd I'll be shoutin' it to, as if a shout'll count\nYo they got accountin' to do, reamount the balance\nThe shit more puzzlin' than a jigsaw\nRaw pitbulls hustlin' through the pitfalls\nSome of y'all toys let the laughter rip roar\nHeart felt truth in every lyric I spit forth\nRaise up time to lift off\nWritten on a legal pad, poetry that sizzle the clip board\nMy og, my homey who taught me deal\nSaid in prayer that's the only time you should ever kneel\nAnd that's real, I'm a take it there"}}, {"title": "Tao of the Machine", "album": "Blade II: The Soundtrack ", "year": null, "lyrics": "Come on, how you want it,

quick..\nTo suck you down to the abyss\nWith the lure of pure bliss if you kiss the dicks\nOf the niggas? Never.. Nosferatu's\nThose witches and warlocks in blue\nGovernment gumshoe, keepers of the First Zoo\nWho? .. Me? ..\nI'm the modern day vixen vampire slayer\nUnauthorized player, in the capitalist contest\nTo see who \"Gets Money\"\nNo milk and honey, in this land\nCause justice has been banned\nSo it's play dirty or die by the hand\nThat's holding all the guns\nPlunged, deep into religion was my first decision\nTo save me and my daughter's lives, but\nI can't thrive off spirit and scripture\nThe picture grew clearer; I made the move to rear her\nIn a life wanting for nothing\nSo I got into this drug thing\nNot doing, but dealing\nSealing fates and, healing struggle gaped, wounds\nOf the doomed became my mission\nIzm was just too small time\nI had to find the best design to\nFuck with the massive motherfuckers minds, and pockets\nSo I sold cock hits and, alleyway thigh splits for two bits\nAnd, five year old preschool pussy\nAnd, once strong now bony backs and stretched out\nWeary racks of snatch, in other words..\n.. I sold crack\nMorality was buried deep, beneath the new Jeep\nSilk sheets and money heaps\nStill the good mother, I sent my daughter off to\nBoarding school to keep shit under cover\nAll the while envisioning myself, a champion of ghetto causes\nPlus his, game I was playing, and winning\nWhile sinning, against myself and soul to get the gold\nI was the Female Don, the Crack Queen\nTo me I seemed unstoppable, my coffers full\nI went buckwild, wanting more\nLike the pipe worn whores I began to deplore\nNo time for playing with my coochie\nCounting my man's mad lucci\nWhile he was up inside some hoochie's loose piece\nI signed the checks and, I counted out the cash\nWasn't saving ass for no niggas sent upriver\nI thought my shit was tight..\n.. til my empire started to quiver\nTaking every chance, under surveillance, being listened to\nAnd watched, like Assata Shakur\nMy place on the top was no more sure\nLoose lips flipped the script\nThe fantasy trip, swiftly ended\nIt took no time to blend in, with the population prison\nMy jaded vision, busted like a cherry\nEvery, dream I had, now tainted bad\nI fucked and, I killed, to prosper\nUpheld each tenant, of the ghastly gospel\nShift to a different Wonderland to pay the price for my vice\nA land of fields to toil in like slaves\nNo lillies in this field just plenty of souls to save\nPlenty of fat uniformed rats with\nBelow average size cocks that slither\nThrough cell locks, in the night\nLactating tits being licked, left and right\nPlenty of coochie, burning with desire\nLike black churches in the South\nBlack prayers and pussy on fire\nPenned up behind barbed wire\nMe and my fellow female mammals, animals\nBitches in cages, bodies racked with hormone rages\nMinds haunted by our children's faces\nThey mace us, with promises of rehabilitation slash corruption\nPlace smoking guns in empty hands of, native sisters and sons\nI joined in this nation's favorite pasttime\nOn a quest to gets mine\nNow I'm passing time standing on line\nIn the commissary to buy Maxi-Pads\nInstead of shopping at Barney's for Chanel bags\nNana who raised me, went to bed a-dazed\nVia my mistakes, and my daughter hates\nMe for what I did\nAnd I'm FUCKED.. and I'm STUCK\nDoing the Devil's bid\nBeing locked in a moral corrupt crib\nPsst.. missing my kid.. psst.. hey girl\nYou wanna get finger fucked tonight?\nI swear I'll stick it in and up tight just right\nYo sis..

style\nCrushin any mental that be fragile\nYou don't wanna see me get like agile\nRippin up tha scene screamin like I was a bad child\nBlack Thought so hip that I'm square\nTha rhythm that you hear is from tha kids right over there\nTha rubberband in question just one step away\nYesterday was a day away attention you should pay today\nTo tha Roots stickin boot kickin with flippa\nI lift tha party

I never sweat coffee\nTha fourth beat following tha third word second after first\nYo never rehearse tha verse that I'm freestylin'\nCause my verse is diverse I'm Mista Versatilin'\nThings are easier with oooh chilin'\nYa smilin because you dig tha way that I deliver\nAnd give a style flowin like I was tha Nile river you shiver\nCause I'm cooler than tha coolest act a fool its like a habit\nSo yo

comin twice in one form\nTha Black'll act a fool and I'm gone\nCrumbs bust it pass tha popcorn\nAs I kick flava behavior your absctract I get recognition\nBut I represent no religon or sect\nSo I'm no preacher but I reach your soul\nCause I'm stronger than younger\nSon of Casandra like ganga I grow\nFrom tha root like water I flow\nCould sport ebrotha low or tha nappy afro\nI still a have tha pick cause I choose to evict\nDerelicts on tha tip tryin to diss tha mad skit busta skit\nHow many licks to it take to make a fake\nRealize that he can't shake bake or penetrate\nThis style I demonstrate on a regular\nBasis in face that he ain't no competitor\nI said it a second ago yo I'm tha anti-circle with tha mad style\nCrushin any mental that be fragile\nYou don't wanna see me get like agile\nRippin up tha scene screamin like I was a bad child\nBlack Thought so hip that I'm square\nTha rhythm that you hear is from tha kids right over there\nTha rubberband in question just one step away\nYesterday was a day away attention you should pay today\nTo tha Roots stickin boot kickin with flippa\nI lift tha party up and y'all get down like a zipper\nTha mista hippa flippa kid tha one who thinks tha music can be hurtin a\nRhythm when I get anti-circular\n\nSquare to tha circle to tha square\nFrom tha square to tha circle to tha square\nFrom tha square to tha circle to tha square\nFrom tha square to tha circle to tha square y'all\nFrom tha square to tha circle to tha square\nFrom tha square to tha circle to tha square\nFrom tha square to tha circle to tha square\nFrom tha square to tha circle to tha square\n\nWhat you spot up with ya peepers is tha creeper\nStompin on tha ground smokin a quarter pound reefer\nMista five finger lead singer noise maker\nNumber one run I'm rush now you must hush\nI crush trail mix with tha sandal\nFive fingers keep a candlestick lit when I vandalize\nCan't see what I is or will be\nOnly what I was cause I crush an MC\nI'm dandy happy go lucky don't touch me\nDon't play cause I'm not tha right one baby\nCrazy off key never talk softly\nBlacker than tha beans still I never sweat coffee\nTha fourth beat following tha third word second after first\nYo never rehearse tha verse that I'm freestylin'\nCause my verse is diverse I'm Mista Versatilin'\nThings are easier with oooh chilin'\nYa smilin because you dig tha way that I deliver\nAnd give a style flowin like I was tha Nile river you shiver\nCause I'm cooler than tha coolest act a fool its like a habit\nSo yo this trick is for tha rabbit\nI grab it and snatch it inspect it like gadget\nI works tha magic tha mic I must have it\nI'm at it kids does tha pin on tha vibe tribe\nMembers do decide to stand around at tha sit down\nGet down can't you know I'm quick to rip a kid down\nAim to put wack rappers in containers with tha lid down\nSo I seal it can you feel it many contacts is caught\nOn a mad train a Black Thought"}}, {"title": "The Coming", "album":

traveled chasing demons screaming all I find I keep\nIf you don't pay like you weigh alright okay that's fine with me\nI'ma just spray my heat and say my piece and lay you down to sleep\nAin't nobody tell you clowns to speak\nI'mma AK you down the street\nDraw that pump that's built for the riots see how quiet y'all can keep\nAin't no wilding it ain't no problem\nIt ain't no question it ain't no beef\nCut that check then things are sweet\nI'ma go buy some diamond teeth\nI'll be damned if my setback gonna help you get back on your feet\nNo surrender no retreat\nNigga we out here trying to eat\nHashtag, diamond dog tag\nMoney bag, nice swag, pockets need an ice bag\nToe tag, body bag\nNiggas lose their lives sad\nRockets in their flight path\nBreaking bad, making bad\nChoices out here thinking fast\nSmoking wet and drinking bad\nSoaking wet and sinking fast\nShoot them niggas making cash\nStick them niggas take their stash\nThe law of gravity meets, the law of averages\nAin't no sense in attempting to civilize savages\nEven though I wish I could be spared my embarrassment\nI'm a nigga, other niggas pale in comparison\nWe out in Paris yet but still a nigga perishing\nNo idea how much time's left, fuck trying to cherish it\nA life in times unchecked, now that's American\nInherit the wind, pressure in everything\n\nThe world ain\u2019t ready for someone like me\nAnd life is sex, stress, drama and I\u2019m hooked on all 3\nI\u2019d rather O.D. than be the next O.G\nYou fronting for a whore that already chose me\nOne man revolution that\u2019s supportin prostitution\nI\u2019m trying pimp the game, where balling don\u2019t mean hooping\nAnd riding don\u2019t mean cruising\nIt mean keep your bitch-ass moving\nIf you ain\u2019t built for bruising, redrum ain\u2019t in your blueprint\nIn a jungle made of concrete, every animal Jumanji\nOn Eazy-E and PCP, ass-cash or EBT\nHow you monetize pigeons on a power line\nOn a road to the riches every dudes a dollar sign\nI don\u2019t mind, I don\u2019t mind, long as all the smoke is mine\nAnd the liquor store delivers faster than a Papa Johns\nAnd I heard that death is calling, money\u2019s on the other line\nThe last episode of Good Times is my life\n\nIt's a phrase they say in the streets when the young players meet:\n\"Get rich or die trying\"\nBut the funny thing about that phrase to me\nIs that these little niggas be lying\nCause don\u2019t nobody wanna die\nBut everybody trying to get rich though\nBut the fucked up thing about that\nThese lil' niggas don\u2019t how to get rich so\nI still run with those angels\nMan I still peep all those angles\nSpeaking with guns, speaking in tongues\nTalking that Arabic and that Yiddish\nRiding them trains, stashing them chains, bangles\nYeah I played all those games, though\nMy tag on the wall, you niggas look up\nYou can still see my name yo\nHow did I end up where I\u2019m at?\nIt\u2019s kind of hard to explain yo\nI remember all I wanted was a gold chain and a Kangol\nI remember all I wanted was a gold chain and some Jordans to\nImpress that bitch, then I got that bitch\nNow all I want from her\u2019s an abortion\nMy mind filled with distortion\nMy eyelids say caution\nYeah I sold crack to get my soul back\nThey say it\u2019s gonna cost a fortune\nAnd I wonder if Allah take debit?\n\u2018Cause a nigga got real bad credit\nIf not I ain\u2019t got a whole lot so a nigga like me just can forget it"}}, {"title": "The Day", "album": "How I Got Over", "year": "2010-06-22", "lyrics": "When I wake up, I look into the mirror\nI can see a clearer, vision\nI should start living today\nCause today is gonna be the day, is gonna be the day\nCause today is gonna be the day, is gonna be the day\n\nYeah, it's like everyday I wake up\nI stare into space and don't say much\nPeer in the mirror, feeling dead from the face up\nCoffee pots, cigarettes, morning J's, Baileys\nSlowing down my day before it picks up the pace\nBeats playing since the night before, thinking about writing songs\nFeeling exhausted from times we toured constant\nAnd plus the toxins I sip got me tall\nStill tipsy, staring at the city from the spot we call Los Angeles\nEvery day is like a blank canvas\nCarving my initials in the planet like I brand it\nHand picked to live this life we take for granted\nLike a child with an upright bass, we can't stand it\nSmiling through the trouble we face, trying to manage\nMy way without pumping my brakes and staying stagnant\nCause I can sit on my ass or  just imagine\nThe madness I did on my path and paint the canvas\n\nWhen I wake up, I look into the mirror\nI can see a clearer, vision\nI should start living today\nCause today is gonna be the day, is gonna be the day\nCause today is gonna be the day, is gonna be the day\n\nBefore I rise and shine like a neon sign\nI need the girl of my dreams to give me Einstein\nAnd burn the marijuan' like Buju Banton\nIt's my only bonafide break from these confines\nI need a change of scenery like a montage\nThese kids bringing me the noise like the Bomb Squad\nAnd everybody coming at me from the blindside\nI'm tired, it's hard to open up my eyes wide\nI listen to some theme music on the iPod\nAnd walk around the crib doing little odd jobs\nChecking my breath, take a view from this high rise\nFeeling like I'm checking out a game from the sideline\nI got to try different things in these trying times\nTwenty-ten is different than it was in nine-five\nIt's come alive time, I picked a fine time\nFor getting  open off life like a fine wine\n\nWhen I wake up, I look into the mirror\nI can see a clearer, vision\nI should start living today\nCause today is gonna be the day, is gonna be the day\nCause today is gonna be the day, is gonna be the day\n\nSunday morning, plan my day out\nWhole new blueprint, brand new layout\nDeep down still don't know if it'll play out\nBut for the first time feel like I done found a way out\nSkin getting clearer and it feel like I lost weight\nStop and say a prayer for the times I lost faith\nTroubles of the world had me in a cross-face\nChicken-wing, sickening, living so off-base\nBut now it's like I'm in the last lap of the car chase\nAnd I finally understand my right to choose\nMy preacher man told me it could always be worse\nEven the three-legged dog still got three good legs to lose\nSo you can stop and refresh the rules\nBreathe in, breathe out, let it heal all your exit wounds\nSomething inside said that's the move\nAnd maybe today I'll restart fresh and new\n\nWhen I wake up, I look into the mirror\nI can see a clearer, vision\nI should start living today\nCause today is gonna be the day, is gonna be the day\nCause today is gonna be the day, is gonna be the day",

"lyrics": "When I wake up, I look into the mirror\nI can see a clearer, vision\nI should start living today\nCause today is gonna be the day, is gonna be the day\nCause today is gonna be the day, is gonna be the day\n\nYeah, it's like everyday I wake up\nI stare into space and don't say much\nPeer in the mirror, feeling dead from the face up\nCoffee pots, cigarettes, morning J's, Baileys\nSlowing down my day before it picks up the pace\nBeats playing since the night before, thinking about writing songs\nFeeling exhausted from times we toured constant\nAnd plus the toxins I sip got me tall\nStill tipsy, staring at the city from the spot we call Los Angeles\nEvery day is like a blank canvas\nCarving my initials in the planet like I brand it\nHand picked to live this life we take for granted\nLike a child with an upright bass, we can't stand it\nSmiling through the trouble we face, trying to manage\nMy way without pumping my brakes and staying stagnant\nCause I can sit on my ass or  just imagine\nThe madness I did on my path and paint the canvas\n\nWhen I wake up, I look into the mirror\nI can see a clearer, vision\nI should start living today\nCause today is gonna be the day, is gonna be the day\nCause today is gonna be the day, is gonna be the day\n\nBefore I rise and shine like a neon sign\nI need the girl of my dreams to give me Einstein\nAnd burn the marijuan' like Buju Banton\nIt's my only bonafide break from these confines\nI need a change of scenery like a montage\nThese kids bringing me the noise like the Bomb Squad\nAnd everybody coming at me from the blindside\nI'm tired, it's hard to open up my eyes wide\nI listen to some theme music on the iPod\nAnd walk around the crib doing little odd jobs\nChecking my breath, take a view from this high rise\nFeeling like I'm checking out a game from the sideline\nI got to try different things in these trying times\nTwenty-ten is different than it was in nine-five\nIt's come alive time, I picked a fine time\nFor getting  open off life like a fine wine\n\nWhen I wake up, I look into the mirror\nI can see a clearer, vision\nI should start living today\nCause today is gonna be the day, is gonna be the day\nCause today is gonna be the day, is gonna be the day\n\nSunday morning, plan my day out\nWhole new blueprint, brand new layout\nDeep down still don't know if it'll play out\nBut for the first time feel like I done found a way out\nSkin getting clearer and it feel like I lost weight\nStop and say a prayer for the times I lost faith\nTroubles of the world had me in a cross-face\nChicken-wing, sickening, living so off-base\nBut now it's like I'm in the last lap of the car chase\nAnd I finally understand my right to choose\nMy preacher man told me it could always be worse\nEven the three-legged dog still got three good legs to lose\nSo you can stop and refresh the rules\nBreathe in, breathe out, let it heal all your exit wounds\nSomething inside said that's the move\nAnd maybe today I'll restart fresh and new\n\nWhen I wake up, I look into the mirror\nI can see a clearer, vision\nI should start living today\nCause today is gonna be the day, is gonna be the day\nCause today is gonna be the day, is gonna be the day"}}, {"title": "The Devil", "album": "\u2026And Then You Shoot Your Cousin", "year": "2014-05-19", "lyrics": "The Devil never rest, come day,

give up\"\nIt's the fire, inside you\nLet it burn\n\nYeah, and if I'm ever at the crossroads\nAnd start feeling mixed signals like Morse code\nMy soul start to grow colder than the North Pole\nI try to focus on the hole of where the torch goes\nIn the tradition of these legendary sports pros\nAs far as I can see, I've made it to the threshold\nLord knows I've waited for this a lifetime\nAnd I'm an icon when I let my light shine\nShine bright as an example of a champion\nTaking the advantage, never copping out or cancelling\nBurn like a chariot, learn how to carry it\nMaverick, always above and beyond average\nFuel to the flame that I train with and travel with\nSomething in my eyes say I'm so close to having the prize\nI realise I'm supposed to reach for the skies\nNever let somebody try to tell you otherwise\n\nThere's something in your heart\nAnd it's in your eyes\nIt's the fire, inside you\nLet it burn\nYou don't say, \"Good luck\"\nYou say, \"Don't give up\"\nIt's the fire, inside you\nLet it burn\n\nOne love, one game, one desire\nOne flame, one bonfire, let it burn higher\nI never show signs of fatigue or turn tired\nCause I'm the definition of tragedy turned triumph\nIt's David and Goliath, I made it to the eye of the storm\nFeeling torn like they fed me to the lions\nBefore my time start to wind down like the Mayans\nI show 'em how I got the grind down like a science\nIt sounds like a riot on hush, it's so quiet\nThe only thing I hear is my heart\nI'm inspired by the challenge\nThat I find myself standing eye to eye with\nThen move like a wise warrior and not a coward\nYou can't escape the history that you was meant to make\nThat's why the highest victory is what I'm meant to take\nYou came to celebrate, I came to cerebrate\nI hate losing, I refuse to make the same mistake\n\nOhhhh, the fire, the fire\nOhhhh, the fire, the fire\n\nThere's something in your heart\nAnd it's in your eyes\nIt's the fire, inside you\nLet it burn\nYou don't

something in your heart\nAnd it's in your eyes\nIt's the fire, inside you\nLet it burn\nYou don't say, \"Good luck\"\nYou say, \"Don't give up\"\nIt's the fire, inside you\nLet it burn\n\nYeah, and if I'm ever at the crossroads\nAnd start feeling mixed signals like Morse code\nMy soul start to grow colder than the North Pole\nI try to focus on the hole of where the torch goes\nIn the tradition of these legendary sports pros\nAs far as I can see, I've made it to the threshold\nLord knows I've waited for this a lifetime\nAnd I'm an icon when I let my light shine\nShine bright as an example of a champion\nTaking the advantage, never copping out or cancelling\nBurn like a chariot, learn how to carry it\nMaverick, always above and beyond average\nFuel to the flame that I train with and travel with\nSomething in my eyes say I'm so close to having the prize\nI realise I'm supposed to reach for the skies\nNever let somebody try to tell you otherwise\n\nThere's something in your heart\nAnd it's in your eyes\nIt's the fire, inside you\nLet it burn\nYou don't say, \"Good luck\"\nYou say, \"Don't give up\"\nIt's the fire, inside you\nLet it burn\n\nOne love, one game, one desire\nOne flame, one bonfire, let it burn higher\nI never show signs of fatigue or turn tired\nCause I'm the definition of tragedy turned triumph\nIt's David and Goliath, I made it to the eye of the storm\nFeeling torn like they fed me to the lions\nBefore my time start to wind down like the Mayans\nI show 'em how I got the grind down like a science\nIt sounds like a riot on hush, it's so quiet\nThe only thing I hear is my heart\nI'm inspired by the challenge\nThat I find myself standing eye to eye with\nThen move like a wise warrior and not a coward\nYou can't escape the history that you was meant to make\nThat's why the highest victory is what I'm meant to take\nYou came to celebrate, I came to cerebrate\nI hate losing, I refuse to make the same mistake\n\nOhhhh, the fire, the fire\nOhhhh, the fire, the fire\n\nThere's something in your heart\nAnd it's in your eyes\nIt's the fire, inside you\nLet it burn\nYou don't say, \"Good luck\"\nYou say, \"Don't give up\"\nIt's the fire, inside you\nLet it burn\n\nOhhhh, the fire, inside you\nThe fire, inside you\nThe fire, inside you"}}, {"title": "The Good The Bad and the Desolate", "album": "High School High (Music From and

"The Hypnotic, the Hypnotic\n\nYo, I knew this girl named Alana with mad persona\nShe dealt with reality, never fed into the drama\nI met her through my nigga named Jermaine Palmer\nWho knew her through his peoples by the Baltimore harbor\nAlana was a Marilyn, thorough and attractive\nShorty that's relaxed with, me and kickin' back\nWith a phat flick to cool out\nWas stressed cause the game'll make you wanna pull a tool out\nAnd go the old-school route\nBut all of that ceased, when that piece, checkin' the jewel out\nA brother was charged, light a spliff and listen to the DeBarge\nLet the shorty hit me with a massage to anoint\nLubricatin' my meridian points\nThat was the summer easy to remember\nAlana was all up on Tariq agenda, how I used to back-bend her\nShe even told her best friend, Linda from Virginia\nWho asked, me if I had a cousin I could recommend her\nBut as time flowed on, we grew more mature and further apart\nWhen I began to do tours, we lost contact\nAnd slowly parted, reminiscin' of when it started\nIt keep me feelin' heavy-hearted, a stolen moment, periodic\nAddicted to her presence like a narcotic\nThough, I wonder if she ever got it, the Hypnotic\nThat faded like a dream sequence that persuaded\nBeyond bein' infatuated, spiritually intoxicated\nCalm, sedated, I concentrated, on how to get in touch with her\nCause the fact of the matter remain that I miss the Hypnotic\n\n\nI would begin to dial, her number\nBut knowing, it's been awhile, it's hard to link\nI figure what she'd probably think and soon start to drink\nFightin' the feelin', I'm concealin', apparently at first appealin'\nLater revealin' to be deeper, resistance increasingly weaker\nThe essence of life is more than just mics and puffin' reefer\nThis universe of Black Thought that I can teach ya\nI'm tryin' to touch ya, only if I can reach ya\nI hit this kid Hassan up on his beeper\nAnd ask him if a had a chance to speak to\nJermaine Palmer, whose father's a preacher\nTo make the story short, me and my man soon ran\nInto each other on the humble, at a show in San Fran\nI said \"Yo Palmer, when did you last see Alana?\"\nHe offered me a seat in attempts to make me calmer\nWhen he began to break it down, my mind start to wander\nResponse beyond somber, incredible crushed\nKinda feeling on my shoulder, that of a boulder\nTo find out that her life was over, it made the room feel colder\nI thought I could get with her when she was a little older\nBut she a victim, of the wicked system that controlled her\nIt's all chaotic, what if my life is symbolic?\nForever shadow on my mental, I never forgot it\nYo, the psychotic, the Hypnotic\nYo, check it out, the most melodic Hypnotic, yeah\n\n*D'Angelo at the end blessing the track with vocals*",

"lyrics": "The Hypnotic, the Hypnotic\n\nYo, I knew this girl named Alana with mad persona\nShe dealt with reality, never fed into the drama\nI met her through my nigga named Jermaine Palmer\nWho knew her through his peoples by the Baltimore harbor\nAlana was a Marilyn, thorough and attractive\nShorty that's relaxed with, me and kickin' back\nWith a phat flick to cool out\nWas stressed cause the game'll make you wanna pull a tool out\nAnd go the old-school route\nBut all of that ceased, when that piece, checkin' the jewel out\nA brother was charged, light a spliff and listen to the DeBarge\nLet the shorty hit me with a massage to anoint\nLubricatin' my meridian points\nThat was the summer easy to remember\nAlana was all up on Tariq agenda, how I used to back-bend her\nShe even told her best friend, Linda from Virginia\nWho asked, me if I had a cousin I could recommend her\nBut as time flowed on, we grew more mature and further apart\nWhen I began to do tours, we lost contact\nAnd slowly parted, reminiscin' of when it started\nIt keep me feelin' heavy-hearted, a stolen moment, periodic\nAddicted to her presence like a narcotic\nThough, I wonder if she ever got it, the Hypnotic\nThat faded like a dream sequence that persuaded\nBeyond bein' infatuated, spiritually intoxicated\nCalm, sedated, I concentrated, on how to get in touch with her\nCause the fact of the matter remain that I miss the Hypnotic\n\n\nI would begin to dial, her number\nBut knowing, it's been awhile, it's hard to link\nI figure what she'd probably think and soon start to drink\nFightin' the feelin', I'm concealin', apparently at first appealin'\nLater revealin' to be deeper, resistance increasingly weaker\nThe essence of life is more than just mics and puffin' reefer\nThis universe of Black Thought that I can teach ya\nI'm tryin' to touch ya, only if I can reach ya\nI hit this kid Hassan up on his beeper\nAnd ask him if a had a chance to speak to\nJermaine Palmer, whose father's a preacher\nTo make the story short, me and my man soon ran\nInto each other on the humble, at a show in San Fran\nI said \"Yo Palmer, when did you last see Alana?\"\nHe offered me a seat in attempts to make me calmer\nWhen he began to break it down, my mind start to wander\nResponse beyond somber, incredible crushed\nKinda feeling on my shoulder, that of a boulder\nTo find out that her life was over, it made the room feel colder\nI thought I could get with her when she was a little older\nBut she a victim, of the wicked system that controlled her\nIt's all chaotic, what if my life is symbolic?\nForever shadow on my mental, I never forgot it\nYo, the psychotic, the Hypnotic\nYo, check it out, the most melodic Hypnotic, yeah\n\n*D'Angelo at the end blessing the track with vocals*"}}, {"title": "The Lesson", "album": null, "year": null, "lyrics": "Well, it's the raw regees, thoroughbred from Philly\nMy name Black Thought, my girl's the Black Lilies\nSome people try to front like, \"I ain't feelin' it really\"\nBut that's silly, 'cuz how the fuck you can't feel me?\nWhen I first felt it, I knew it had to be dealt wit'\nA lot of ice-grillin' in the house got melted\nSome tried to put up a fight, but they was helpless\nYou ain't tryin' to turn that loose, you too selfish\nGimme that, guess who bringin' the, 'get busy' back\nWomen say the sound of my voice, the aphrodisiac\nE-me and when I'm in your town, come see me\nThe Real World for real, this ain't your MTV\nThe illest innervisions since Stevie on wax\nMy vocal like serve on forty-eight tracks\nThe fact of the matter is a matter of fact\nThat it's the Black Thought, controllin' like Ike Turner\nYou wanna get wise, you best to be a fast learner\nOr just relax and peep how it's done\nAnd boogie ya ass to what's about to come because\nThe lesson, now it's now, we close shop\nWe got it locked, it's over now\nAiyyo Dice's flows, hit idiots like crossbows\nKnock 'em out the atlas, push 'em off the atlas\nI'm laughin', lookin' down from off top the totem\nHop off my pedastal, grab my scrotum\nAiyyo y'all niggas ain't fuckin' it' this shit\nAiyyo y'all ain't fuckin' wit' the Roots crew\nThe bouncers were wild, yeah, 'cuz my family bouncin'\nSoon as the name, Dice Raw is announced in\nThe arena, the grass is greener on the other side\nI hit the stores, twenty-five thousand die\nNow tell who the best in off the top in the world\nI'll give you a hint, the same guy that's fuckin' your girl\nI just didn't have parents, The Roots found me in the trash\nBut still, a nigga got a lot of class\nTrick wit' my pinky-finger up off the glass\nKeep talkin' shit homeboy, that's your ass\nThe lesson, now it's now, we close shop\nWe got it locked, it's over now\nIt's just the simple part of the game\nI guess it's just the art of the scam\nCheck for your soul 'cuz it departed again\nMillitant is atomic, you fall from the sky just like a comet\nMove out till the bottom of my shoes out\nHow many tracks do you bout?\nHow many of these niggas you doubt?\nHow many of these ladies makin' you shout?\nYou on a mission so listen to this\nAsk yourself, what condition is this?\nI'm sick in the wrist, I rap on a satellite dish\nYou gotta like this\nAskin' me about the way that I stroll\nAbout the way I enfold, in scrambling mode\nYou're like that, don't bark, cat bite back\nWhat up Blood? Is things still the same in the hood?\nWhile I sit I gotta get dub and wish I could plug\nThey thoughts'll leave 'em stiff in the mud\nYou wannabe thug in section eight\nHouses were hush up under the rug\nThe shit I spit is hummin' wit' slugs, get soaked in the suds\nThe lesson, now it's now, we close shop\nWe got it locked, it's over now\nThe lesson, now it's now, we close shop\nWe got it locked,

people try to front like, \"I ain't feelin' it really\"\nBut that's silly, 'cuz how the fuck you can't feel me?\nWhen I first felt it, I knew it had to be dealt wit'\nA lot of ice-grillin' in the house got melted\nSome tried to put up a fight, but they was helpless\nYou ain't tryin' to turn that loose, you too selfish\nGimme that, guess who bringin' the, 'get busy' back\nWomen say the sound of my voice, the aphrodisiac\nE-me and when I'm in your town, come see me\nThe Real World for real, this ain't your MTV\nThe illest innervisions since Stevie on wax\nMy vocal like serve on forty-eight tracks\nThe fact of the matter is a matter of fact\nThat it's the Black Thought, controllin' like Ike Turner\nYou wanna get wise, you best to be a fast learner\nOr just relax and peep how it's done\nAnd boogie ya ass to what's about to come because\nThe lesson, now it's now, we close shop\nWe got it locked, it's over now\nAiyyo Dice's flows, hit idiots like crossbows\nKnock 'em out the atlas, push 'em off the atlas\nI'm laughin', lookin' down from off top the totem\nHop off my pedastal, grab my scrotum\nAiyyo y'all niggas ain't fuckin' it' this shit\nAiyyo y'all ain't fuckin' wit' the Roots crew\nThe bouncers were wild, yeah, 'cuz my family bouncin'\nSoon as the name, Dice Raw is announced in\nThe arena, the grass is greener on the other side\nI hit the stores, twenty-five thousand die\nNow tell who the best in off the top in the world\nI'll give you a hint, the same guy that's fuckin' your girl\nI just didn't have parents, The Roots found me in the trash\nBut still, a nigga got a lot of class\nTrick wit' my pinky-finger up off the glass\nKeep talkin' shit homeboy, that's your ass\nThe lesson, now it's now, we close shop\nWe got it locked, it's over now\nIt's just the simple part of the game\nI guess it's just the art of the scam\nCheck for your soul 'cuz it departed again\nMillitant is atomic, you fall from the sky just like a comet\nMove out till the bottom of my shoes out\nHow many tracks do you bout?\nHow many of these niggas you doubt?\nHow many of these ladies makin' you shout?\nYou on a mission so listen to this\nAsk yourself, what condition is this?\nI'm sick in the wrist, I rap on a satellite dish\nYou gotta like this\nAskin' me about the way that I stroll\nAbout the way I enfold, in scrambling mode\nYou're like that, don't bark, cat bite back\nWhat up Blood? Is things still the same in the hood?\nWhile I sit I gotta get dub and wish I could plug\nThey thoughts'll leave 'em stiff in the mud\nYou wannabe thug in section eight\nHouses were hush up under the rug\nThe shit I spit is hummin' wit' slugs, get soaked in the suds\nThe lesson, now it's now, we close shop\nWe got it locked, it's over now\nThe lesson, now it's now, we close shop\nWe got it locked,

trey\nAnd used to boost gray Kangol's\nWith 555 Soul's from the streets\nOf the Ill-a-delphiadaic insane\nFor monetary gain, niggas is slain on the train\nIt's homicide\nFor wealth stealth missions for crack\nIn the alleyways, where niggas get grazed in the back\nFrom stray shots\nClips with hollow tips, for your spine or\nEither remain calm, catch a rhyme, to your mind\nNiggas ya know my style\nI run a--motherfuckin-rap--muk\nWhen Malik get a U-Haul truck\nI stand five, foot seven, in command of the party\nAnd scam like Uncle Sam\nI'm never caught up in the glass eye\nOf your action cam, cause I'm down low\nArtistic exquisite rap pro, that get the dough\nIt's the Philly borough dread\nThoroughbread for dolo\nI bag solo, like a nigga that boost Polo\nSteppin through the corridor, of metaphors\nLookin over my left\nShoulder the mic, still feel colder than before\nWith this jazz shit I hit your jaw\nDice Raw, get up on the mic, my young poor\nI be the nigga blowin up the spot on tour\nSurely real to the core, old school like eighty-four\nI never die, and raps till my lungs collapse\nThen relax until my knack for tracks\nBring it back, on time\nWhen I rhyme my rep remain\nEither go against the grain or your ass is found slain\nI overcome, niggas want styles then I throw you some\nShow you some, get on the mic and take it over son\nDice Raw, the motherfuckin Wild Noid\nGet on the mic and perpetratin is void\n\nYa leave niggas missin in action like their dads in the projects\nMy style like an old mac, travel round and catch wreck\nI'm ill versatile, with the skill no more\nWack MC's wanna flex but their styles they bore\nGot to know the real meaning of the ill shit, kid\nI do mad damage but never will catch a bid\nWith my knapsack, full of ill shit that I just boosted\nFrom the corner store when I let loose more\nFlavor that's me, rippin heads off from the seams\nNiggas didn't play like Jeru and Come Clean\n(he heh ha ha ha) I beat down on they heads like drum machines\nOr 808's cause my style flows out great\nAnd superspectac, with all the raw rap\nPull a metal chair out my knapsack across your back ka-crack\nNow do you feel the pain of course\nI guess you're believin that I'm insane\nWhen I'm taggin my name, upon the train I got so much pride\nI got so much soul, with lyrics high\nTo make niggas stop drop and roll, now check me out one time\nFor your ass, fat styles equivalent\nOf an AIDS infected Glock blast\nNiggas know my style, plus they know they want more\nProps from Mount Vernon, to Mount Rushmore\nOK kid, you know my style is buckwild literature\nThat you can never get when I'm thinkin your particular\nFlavor that you want\nI sit back and smoke a fat blunt in class\nTeachers can kiss my ass, I'm twice, Dice\nNigga de Raw, never take a bad fall\nSmack your head up against the wall\nLike playin handball, my style's ill\nI slam like Hulk Hogan, Dice Raw bettin on my arm\nNiggas know my slogan while I breathe your last breath\nNiggas better watch they step, fat bull catch wreck\nIll, gots ta keep you in check\nWith the hellified beats and hard rhymes\nNiggas know my style, when I go the whole nine\nI beat down punks, cut em up into fruit chunks\nLike fruit salad, my style's smooth like white owl\nBlunts, so whatcha want if you got beef then come get it\nIf ya don't well then forget it\nMy rap style's exquisite, I'm Raw Daddy\nLike niggas with no Trojans on the stage when I rhyme\nI gots ta keep, my composure\nWhere I'm from it's like a whole different world\nHoppin a train honeydip and I'ma snatch your squirrel\nMost corrupt, motherfucker in the tenth grade\nJuvenile cause Jeff McKay could not fade\nDon't ask me honey I'm not the one for stressin\nIf you wanna know better ask BR.O.Th.E.R ?\nCause he know the time like I know the time\nWhen I grab the microphone\nIt's like, summertime, laid back, to recline\nIn my La-Z-Boy chair\nDice Raw, the Wild Noid\nI'm the fuck up outta here",

Polo\nSteppin through the corridor, of metaphors\nLookin over my left\nShoulder the mic, still feel colder than before\nWith this jazz shit I hit your jaw\nDice Raw, get up on the mic, my young poor\nI be the nigga blowin up the spot on tour\nSurely real to the core, old school like eighty-four\nI never die, and raps till my lungs collapse\nThen relax until my knack for tracks\nBring it back, on time\nWhen I rhyme my rep remain\nEither go against the grain or your ass is found slain\nI overcome, niggas want styles then I throw you some\nShow you some, get on the mic and take it over son\nDice Raw, the motherfuckin Wild Noid\nGet on the mic and perpetratin is void\n\nYa leave niggas missin in action like their dads in the projects\nMy style like an old mac, travel round and catch wreck\nI'm ill versatile, with the skill no more\nWack MC's wanna flex but their styles they bore\nGot to know the real meaning of the ill shit, kid\nI do mad damage but never will catch a bid\nWith my knapsack, full of ill shit that I just boosted\nFrom the corner store when I let loose more\nFlavor that's me, rippin heads off from the seams\nNiggas didn't play like Jeru and Come Clean\n(he heh ha ha ha) I beat down on they heads like drum machines\nOr 808's cause my style flows out great\nAnd superspectac, with all the raw rap\nPull a metal chair out my knapsack across your back ka-crack\nNow do you feel the pain of course\nI guess you're believin that I'm insane\nWhen I'm taggin my name, upon the train I got so much pride\nI got so much soul, with lyrics high\nTo make niggas stop drop and roll, now check me out one time\nFor your ass, fat styles equivalent\nOf an AIDS infected Glock blast\nNiggas know my style, plus they know they want more\nProps from Mount Vernon, to Mount Rushmore\nOK kid, you know my style is buckwild literature\nThat you can never get when I'm thinkin your particular\nFlavor that you want\nI sit back and smoke a fat blunt in class\nTeachers can kiss my ass, I'm twice, Dice\nNigga de Raw, never take a bad fall\nSmack your head up against the wall\nLike playin handball, my style's ill\nI slam like Hulk Hogan, Dice Raw bettin on my arm\nNiggas know my slogan while I breathe your last breath\nNiggas better watch they step, fat bull catch wreck\nIll, gots ta keep you in check\nWith the hellified beats and hard rhymes\nNiggas know my style, when I go the whole nine\nI beat down punks, cut em up into fruit chunks\nLike fruit salad, my style's smooth like white owl\nBlunts, so whatcha want if you got beef then come get it\nIf ya don't well then forget it\nMy rap style's exquisite, I'm Raw Daddy\nLike niggas with no Trojans on the stage when I rhyme\nI gots ta keep, my composure\nWhere I'm from it's like a whole different world\nHoppin a train honeydip and I'ma snatch your squirrel\nMost corrupt, motherfucker in the tenth grade\nJuvenile cause Jeff McKay could not fade\nDon't ask me honey I'm not the one for stressin\nIf you wanna know better ask BR.O.Th.E.R ?\nCause he know the time like I know the time\nWhen I grab the microphone\nIt's like, summertime, laid back, to recline\nIn my La-Z-Boy chair\nDice Raw, the Wild Noid\nI'm the fuck up outta here"}}, {"title": "The Lesson Part 3 (It's Over Now)", "album": "The Roots Come Alive", "year": null, "lyrics": "Well it's the boul Riq' Gees, thoroughbred from Philly\nMy name

people try to front like, I ain't feeling it, really\"\nBut that's silly 'cuz how the fuck you can't feel me?\nWhen I first felt it, I knew it had to be dealt wit\nA lot of ice grilling in the house got melted\nSome tried to put up a fight but they was helpless\nYou ain't try to turn that loose, you too selfish\nGimme that, guess who bringing the 'Get Busy' back?\nWomen say the sound of my voice, the Afro-disiac\nE-me and when I'm in your town, come see me\n'The Real World' for real, this ain't your MTV\nThe illest innervisions since Stevie on wax\nMy vocal like serve-o forty-eight tracks\nThe fact of the matter is a matter of fact\nThat it's the Black Thought, controlling like Ike Turner\nYou wanna get wise, you best to be a fast learner\nOr just relax and peep how it's done\nAnd boogie ya ass to what's about to come because\nThe lesson, now it's now, we close shop\nWe got it locked, it's over now\nAiyyo, Dice's flows hit idiots like crossbows\nKnock 'em out the Atlas, push 'em off the Atlas\nI'm laughing, looking down from off top the totem\nHop off my pedestal, grab my scrotum\nAiyyo, y'all niggas ain't fucking wit this shit\n(I told 'em)\nAiyyo, y'all ain't fucking wit the Roots crew\n(I told 'em)\nThe rap is a riot, yeah 'cuz my family bouncing\nSoon as the name, Dice Raw is announced in\nThe arena, the grass is greener on the other side\nI hit the stores, twenty-five thousand die\nNow tell who the best in off the top in the world\nI'll give you a hint, the same guy that's fucking your girl\nI just didn't have parents, The Roots found me in the trash\nBut still a nigga got a lot of class\nTrick wit my pinky finger up off the glass\nKeep talking shit, homeboy, that's your ass\nThe lesson, now it's now, we close shop\nWe got it locked, it's over now\nIt's just the simple part of the game\nI guess it's just the art of the scam\nCheck for your soul 'cuz it departed again\nMilitant is atomic, you fall from the sky just like a comet\nMove out 'til the bottom of my shoes out\nHow many tracks do you 'bout?\nHow many of these niggas you doubt?\nHow many of these ladies making you shout?\nYou on a mission, so listen to this\nAsk yourself what condition is this\nSick in the , I rap on a satellite disk\nYou gotta like this, asking me about the way that I stroll\nAbout the way I enfold in scrambling mode\nYou're like that, don't bark, cat, bite back\nWhat up, Blood? Is things still the same in the hood?\nWhile I sit, I gotta get dub and wish I could plug\nThey thoughts'll leave 'em stiff in the mud, you wannabe thug\nIn section eight, houses were hush up under the rug\nThe shit I spit is humming wit slugs, get soaked in the suds\nThe lesson, now it's now, we close shop\nWe got it locked, it's over now\nThe lesson, now it's now, we close shop\nWe got it

too bent\nYou theatrical as a Broadway play, this ain't Rent\nOne hundred percent, straight out the Basement\nSpreading this across a planet on some next shit\nHow many people feelin' this love music? C'mon\n\nYo, you go\nHey you listeners, stop what you're doin and\nSet it in motion, it's the next movement\nYou listeners, stop what you're doin and\nSet it in motion, it's the next movement\n\nWord up, we got the hot-hot music, the hot music\nThe hot-hot music music, the hot music\nThe hot-hot music music, the hot music\nThe hot-hot music music, the hot music"}}, {"title": "The 'Notic", "album":

might say I could be doing something positive\nHumble head down low and broke like promises\nSoaking and broken in a joke like comics is\nNot enough paper to be paying folks compliments\nBut when that paper got low so did my tolerance\nAnd it ain\u2019t no truth in a dare without the consequence\nListen if it not for these hood inventions\nI'd just be another kid from the block with no intentions\nOn the dock of that bay serving a life sentence\nEven if I\u2019m going to hell I\u2019m gonna make an entrance\nYeah let em know I\u2019m getting cheese like omeletes is\nBut I\u2019m the

time like it\u2019s counterfeit\nEverybody catching hay fever like sinuses\nStep in my arena let me show y\u2019all who the highness is\nYou might say I could be doing something positive\nHumble head down low and broke like promises\nSoaking and broken in a joke like comics is\nNot enough paper to be paying folks compliments\nBut when that paper got low so did my tolerance\nAnd it ain\u2019t no truth in a dare without the consequence\nListen if it not for these hood inventions\nI'd just be another kid from the block with no intentions\nOn the dock of that bay serving a life sentence\nEven if I\u2019m going to hell I\u2019m gonna make an entrance\nYeah let em know I\u2019m getting cheese like omeletes is\nBut I\u2019m the toast of the town like Thomas is\n\nWe\u2019re all on a journey\nDown the hall of memories\nDon\u2019t worry bout what you ain\u2019t got\nLeave with a little bit of dignity\nNever loved what I had\nAlways felt like I deserved more\nBut when I\nMake it to the other side\nMake it to the other side\nThat\u2019s when we\u2019ll settle up the score\n\nYo, we did this in remembrance of\nFaces from the past we no longer have an image of\nCarrying coldblooded hearts that never been for love\nBrothers keep going for theirs but never get enough\nWorld travelers that seen it all and did enough\nOnly to return to learn the world wasn\u2019t big enough\nDamn, how long has it been? I guess the jig is up\nNow all I know is I\u2019m about to wake this nigga up\nYeah that hindsight, 20/20, now niggas dead on the money\nTrying to take something from me it\u2019s a wrap like a mummy\nUndun I am becoming and when he\u2019s tired of running\nThrough the layers of the onion\nHe\u2019ll probably shed a tear cause they\u2019ll be no more fast times\nJust his weak mind scrolled out like a bad sign\nHe never had enough and got confused when they asked why\nLife is only a moment in time and it passed by\n\nWe\u2019re all on a journey\nDown the hall of memories\nDon\u2019t worry bout what you ain\u2019t got\nLeave with a little bit of dignity\nNever loved what I had\nAlways felt like I deserved more\nBut when I\nMake it to the other side\nMake it to the other side\nThat\u2019s when we\u2019ll settle up the score\n\nI\u2019m sitting on top of the world ready to jump off\nThinking of various ways to break a gun law\nThinking that enough is enough but still I want more\nThinking of how I\u2019m playing with fire that burned my young bol\nBy any means necessary, don\u2019t give a damn\nSo every night I\u2019m on a flight that never lands\nBe an asshole when the shit hits the fan\nOr bet your life on a bluff and a bad hand\nCan\u2019t win, can\u2019t lose\nGet 'em gassed, leave em leaking fuel\nEither way the market moves\nCash rules kings, queens, prince and princess\nEvery night I\u2019m crossing a line that ain\u2019t the finish\nEvery thought is dark as a glass of fucking Guinness\nToo far gone to come back to my senses\nNow I\u2019m on the edge of my bed making love to my meds\nEvery moment's like a pistol to my head\nWhen I\u2019m getting mine\n\nWe\u2019re all on a journey\nDown the hall of memories\nDon\u2019t worry bout what you ain\u2019t got\nLeave with a little bit of dignity\nNever loved what I had\nAlways felt like I deserved more\nBut when I\nMake it to the other side\nMake it to the other side\nThat\u2019s when we\u2019ll settle up the score"}}, {"title": "The Return to Innocence Lost", "album": "Things Fall Apart", "year": "1999-02-23", "lyrics": "(Ursula Rucker)\nMuffled sound of fist on flesh\nBlows to chest\nNo

then...\nDaddy wants to fuck\nDick hard, swelled with power rush\nAnd as if all that wasn't enough\nMommy's seven months heavy with birth\nAs...Daddy grunts and cursed drunk nothings in her bloodied

shredded, and weak\nFrom being daily beat\nAnd Friday nights were the worst and...\nDaddy never came with flowers\nInstead he spent hours at some corner spot\nWith some bar pop named Cookie\nPutting his thing down\nSoiling Mommy's sheets with...\nSweet...talk shit\nCookie's cheap lipstick\nHair grease, sperm, and jezebel juice\nTo hell with the good news that...\nHe was a father for the first time\nHis thirst for wine and women\nClouded his vision...\nNo warm welcome for mother and son\nJust...\nThe rank smell of ass-crack, funk, and cum\nBut Mommy's prayerful strength-her best defense\nShe...burned the dirty linens\nMade a fresh bed\nLaid sleeping First Son down\nAnd never made a sound\nAs she purged her scourge\nWith birth-blood and quiet tears\nWatching as her fears and love and sacrifice\nLie there in his soft skin and new life\nBreathing, dreaming, fresh from God's eye\nMommy's little survivor\nLike...her\nMommy called crazy and scorned\n'Cuz she two more born\nOne boy soon after\nThe girl much later and...\nAlthough they were both sung the same lullabies of hate\nHer...First Son, the first one\nWhose...womb-world was profaned\nCame of age playing street games\nWith Stewie, Rezzie, and Little Brother\n'Till his heart start to wither\nIn pain and shame\nBlamed Mom for the wrong she let Daddy do to her\nAnd him...\nLet...sins of the Father cause his Innocence to wander\nFound honor amongst thieves\nChose to squander his dreams\nStopped believing in himself\nBecome prodigal with his life\nMake impossible shit right with...\nGang-ties, crime, lies\nErase wise, woeful words of Mother\nReplaced them with absurdities of others\nWho had also lost their way\nPlayed a different kind of street game now\nFirst Son plunged deep\nSpeak street-family vows\nEspouse no causes but his own\nSee, he couldn't protect Mommy's neck from Daddy's grasp\nOr...protect Mommy's ass from Daddy's wrath\nCouldn't shield her ears from...\nDaddy's foul-mouthed, liquor-breath jeers\nHis only defense-served be confidence\nBrown bottles housed his swift descent\nPhones called cops on block frequent for his shenanigans\nNow...Daddy and him twins in addiction\nDriven to false-hearted heavens and friends\nBy liquefied demons\nHad become what he despised from Conception 'til End\nDestined for a demise\nSurvived nine lives of staying high\nConning, jewelry-pawning, arrests, theft\nWomanizing...only for money, never for sex\nBullet in chest, baseball bat to the head\nLeft for dead\nSo, eyes wide and glassy\nSpeech...slowed and slurred\nLips twitched with caked-up codeine candy\nAnd mouth corners one December 24th\nMr. Hide and False Friend\nTook final ride to suburban supplier\nShots were fired by the gray man\nWith shaky hand\nBut not shaky enough to miss...\nHit...Lost Boy in back\nSo-called Friend runs for door\nLeaves First Son blood-born\nLying alone in blood on cold floor\nDeath was the cost of...\nReturning to Innocence Lost...\nBaby 'Sis awake for dawn on Christmas morn\nTo Mommy's sobs and shakes\nDaddy's silhouettes of regret\nAll past, omitted, and absolved by lost\nAs they clung to each other\nKnowing...",

gasps\nYou ain't nothing but white trash, bitch!\nWith each hit, each kick, each...broken rib\nCrack, Crack!\nBones are crying\nMommy's crying and bleeding\nAnd pleading\nAnd then...\nDaddy wants to fuck\nDick hard, swelled with power rush\nAnd as if all that wasn't enough\nMommy's seven months heavy with birth\nAs...Daddy grunts and cursed drunk nothings in her bloodied ear\n(singing softly)\nFirst...lullaby\nFirst...Son...will...ever...hear\nAnd never forget\nMommy almost bled to death when she have him...finally\nShe'd already lost...three\nUterus-bruised, shredded, and weak\nFrom being daily beat\nAnd Friday nights were the worst and...\nDaddy never came with flowers\nInstead he spent hours at some corner spot\nWith some bar pop named Cookie\nPutting his thing down\nSoiling Mommy's sheets with...\nSweet...talk shit\nCookie's cheap lipstick\nHair grease, sperm, and jezebel juice\nTo hell with the good news that...\nHe was a father for the first time\nHis thirst for wine and women\nClouded his vision...\nNo warm welcome for mother and son\nJust...\nThe rank smell of ass-crack, funk, and cum\nBut Mommy's prayerful strength-her best defense\nShe...burned the dirty linens\nMade a fresh bed\nLaid sleeping First Son down\nAnd never made a sound\nAs she purged her scourge\nWith birth-blood and quiet tears\nWatching as her fears and love and sacrifice\nLie there in his soft skin and new life\nBreathing, dreaming, fresh from God's eye\nMommy's little survivor\nLike...her\nMommy called crazy and scorned\n'Cuz she two more born\nOne boy soon after\nThe girl much later and...\nAlthough they were both sung the same lullabies of hate\nHer...First Son, the first one\nWhose...womb-world was profaned\nCame of age playing street games\nWith Stewie, Rezzie, and Little Brother\n'Till his heart start to wither\nIn pain and shame\nBlamed Mom for the wrong she let Daddy do to her\nAnd him...\nLet...sins of the Father cause his Innocence to wander\nFound honor amongst thieves\nChose to squander his dreams\nStopped believing in himself\nBecome prodigal with his life\nMake impossible shit right with...\nGang-ties, crime, lies\nErase wise, woeful words of Mother\nReplaced them with absurdities of others\nWho had also lost their way\nPlayed a different kind of street game now\nFirst Son plunged deep\nSpeak street-family vows\nEspouse no causes but his own\nSee, he couldn't protect Mommy's neck from Daddy's grasp\nOr...protect Mommy's ass from Daddy's wrath\nCouldn't shield her ears from...\nDaddy's foul-mouthed, liquor-breath jeers\nHis only defense-served be confidence\nBrown bottles housed his swift descent\nPhones called cops on block frequent for his shenanigans\nNow...Daddy and him twins in addiction\nDriven to false-hearted heavens and friends\nBy liquefied demons\nHad become what he despised from Conception 'til End\nDestined for a demise\nSurvived nine lives of staying high\nConning, jewelry-pawning, arrests, theft\nWomanizing...only for money, never for sex\nBullet in chest, baseball bat to the head\nLeft for dead\nSo, eyes wide and glassy\nSpeech...slowed and slurred\nLips twitched with caked-up codeine candy\nAnd mouth corners one December 24th\nMr. Hide and False Friend\nTook final ride to suburban supplier\nShots were fired by the gray man\nWith shaky hand\nBut not shaky enough to miss...\nHit...Lost Boy in back\nSo-called Friend runs for door\nLeaves First Son blood-born\nLying alone in blood on cold floor\nDeath was the cost of...\nReturning to Innocence Lost...\nBaby 'Sis awake for dawn on Christmas morn\nTo Mommy's sobs and shakes\nDaddy's silhouettes of regret\nAll past, omitted, and absolved by lost\nAs they clung to each other\nKnowing..."}}, {"title": "The Seed",

shine, but the legacy that I leave behind be the seed\nThat'll keep the flame\nI don't ask for much but enough room to spread these wings\nAnd the world finna know my name\n(Verse 4: Cody Chesnutt)\nI don't beg\nFor no rich man\nAnd I don't scream, and kick, when his shit don't fall in my hands, man\nCuz I know how to still\nFertilize another against my lover's will\nI lick the opposition cuz she don't take no pill\nOoh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-no dear\nYou'll be keeping my legend alive\nI push my seed in her bush for life\nIts gonna work because I'm pushin' it right\nIf Mary drops my baby girl tonight\nI would name her Rock-N-Roll\nOh-ooh break it down, break it down, break down beat\n(break)\nI push my seed somewhere deep in her chest\nI push it naked cuz I've takin my test\nDeliverin'

prophet, or a stone to build upon\nAnd what's the reason I still perform, feeding my children on\nHow I'm on a hustle from dusk till dawn\nWhere all the love and the trust is gone\nMy eyes wider than a baby that just was born\nFightin a war they ain't pay me enough to join\nBehind a phrase they was crazy enough to coin\nYou kiddin me?\nThe pursuit of happiness, life, Liberty\nAnd all type a necessities they not givin me\nI put my body in jeopardy\nCuz im committed\nEven though they try to stifle ya man creativity\nThey got hopes and plans a gettin rid of me\nI hit em like ethiopia hit up Italy\nSwift as the bullet that killed\nKing and Kennedy\nYou know the battle is on for infinity, now\n\n\nI remember the show\nLike dougie\nWhen people quiet was ugly\nYellin get money\nNow the show done went dummy\nStill doin shows where the spots be bummy\nRoaches in the dressing room\nI'm thinkin of a better room\nMaybe the upper where my people won't suffer\nThe leather gets tougher we drive like a trucker\nThru the night\nFor every wrong makin 2 rights\nAnd use mics to reach new heights, the blue lights\nFollow\nI guess it's the scent of Chicago\nThat make em wanna mess em up tomorrow\nIn these borrowed days\nThe rhyme and the mind that pays\nThe world is a show you define ya stage\n1, 2\nIts live so you can't undo\nNo sleep cuz then ya dreams won't come true\nAnd everyone's like a broad that we run thru\nEach venya\nThis ain't gon stop so we just gon continya\n\n\nThe Ernest Hemmingway of B-Boy poems\nThey can never take the pen away of LeRoi Jones\nPushin' a black Yukon gold in a new time zone\nDiggin' on every nuance with two eyes closed\nThe life I chose is more of a mission\nI make a crowd convulse and act on impulse and intuition\nI've seen the future, listen, believe the superstition\nI keep spittin' 'til it's a truce or crucifixion\nI\u2019m at home in the pressure zone, weakness is never shown\nLet alone I'm a man made of mere flesh and bone\nI can't help that my heart beat as a metronome\nAnd I've acquired a taste that's upper echelon\nLyrical professional, maniac megalo\nPlate in my head that spin the way the record go\nAnd break it down like it's the walls of Jericho\nIf they don't know by know they prob'ly never know\n(Hook)", "image": "https://images.genius.com/e415802f1331a049bcbf0af9916e51d9.500x500x1.jpg", "artist": "The

"lyrics": "The Show The Show\nIt Must Go On\nThe Show The Show\nIt Must Go On\nI Can't Stop\nI Won't Stop\nI Will Not\nI Will Ride\nThe Show\n\nUh\nAnd Im still the one\nAm I a poet or a prophet, or a stone to build upon\nAnd what's the reason I still perform, feeding my children on\nHow I'm on a hustle from dusk till dawn\nWhere all the love and the trust is gone\nMy eyes wider than a baby that just was born\nFightin a war they ain't pay me enough to join\nBehind a phrase they was crazy enough to coin\nYou kiddin me?\nThe pursuit of happiness, life, Liberty\nAnd all type a necessities they not givin me\nI put my body in jeopardy\nCuz im committed\nEven though they try to stifle ya man creativity\nThey got hopes and plans a gettin rid of me\nI hit em like ethiopia hit up Italy\nSwift as the bullet that killed\nKing and Kennedy\nYou know the battle is on for infinity, now\n\n\nI remember the show\nLike dougie\nWhen people quiet was ugly\nYellin get money\nNow the show done went dummy\nStill doin shows where the spots be bummy\nRoaches in the dressing room\nI'm thinkin of a better room\nMaybe the upper where my people won't suffer\nThe leather gets tougher we drive like a trucker\nThru the night\nFor every wrong makin 2 rights\nAnd use mics to reach new heights, the blue lights\nFollow\nI guess it's the scent of Chicago\nThat make em wanna mess em up tomorrow\nIn these borrowed days\nThe rhyme and the mind that pays\nThe world is a show you define ya stage\n1, 2\nIts live so you can't undo\nNo sleep cuz then ya dreams won't come true\nAnd everyone's like a broad that we run thru\nEach venya\nThis ain't gon stop so we just gon continya\n\n\nThe Ernest Hemmingway of B-Boy poems\nThey can never take the pen away of LeRoi Jones\nPushin' a black Yukon gold in a new time zone\nDiggin' on every nuance with two eyes closed\nThe life I chose is more of a mission\nI make a crowd convulse and act on impulse and intuition\nI've seen the future, listen, believe the superstition\nI keep spittin' 'til it's a truce or crucifixion\nI\u2019m at home in the pressure zone, weakness is never shown\nLet alone I'm a man made of mere flesh and bone\nI can't help that my heart beat as a metronome\nAnd I've acquired a taste that's upper echelon\nLyrical professional, maniac megalo\nPlate in my head that spin the way the record go\nAnd break it down like it's the walls of Jericho\nIf they don't know by know they prob'ly never know\n(Hook)"}}, {"title": "The Spark", "album": "Things Fall Apart", "year": "1999-02-23", "lyrics": "Yo, the feet that I walk with\nThe ears that I hear with, the eyes that I see with\nThe mouth that I talk with, the terror that I stalk with\nNow it's time to spark shit\nYo, the feet that I walk with\nThe ears that I hear with, the eyes that I see with\nThe mouth that I talk with, the terror that I stalk with\nNow it's time to spark shit\n\nLook Ock, I walk around a little edgy already\nY'all MC's come into my face, but my aim's steady\nM-illitant is skilled in most strategic plan\nI float across seas and, breezed across land?\nStanding, in these thoughts of murder within\nDestructor of this world that's corrupted with sin\nI'm always hitting, to leave MC's guessing\nFor any transgression, in my perimeter\nThere will be a blessing, and your explicit intoxicated\nBuddha session, to stop stressing\nMe with the madness, putting niggas on my had list\nNo sadness is felt, you shuffled and your cards get dealt\nJim Carrey ass niggas start to melt\nImpact like a buckle bein' swung from off a belt\nAny help for shelter, when in the realms of a welter\nMy weight will tilt ya, hold alignments and change your filter\nMy attitude a product of society\nSo sometimes for gratitude, you know you can't rely on me\nNiggas eyeing me, with looks of they anxiety\nWondering what's in my heart, velocity or piety\nYo, it depends on which one, you bring to surface\nAt times I get trife, but what to worship is my purpose\nMalik B blend with the tree, to spot an enemy\nYou clogging me up cat, now vacate the vicinity\n\nYo, the feet that I walk with\nThe ears that I hear with, the eyes that I see with\nThe mouth that I talk with, the terror that I stalk with\nNow it's time to spark shit\nYo, the feet that I walk with\nThe ears that I hear with, the eyes that I see with\nThe mouth that I talk with, the terror that I stalk with\nNow it's time to spark shit\n\nI'm symbolic to a ballot, it's Abdul Malik\nDon't approach with bullshit, I'm quick to call it invalid\nRoute through your district, we keep it simplistic\nNo need for the rapper to talk, put it on halt\nShow me the vault, or the safe, cause I'm on the paper chase\nWade through route states for bout thirty down my waist\nI'm tryna get it, these rain bottling thoughts become acidic\nWith one in the chamber, ready to aim and spit it\nA girlfriend and team made nigga cash just splintered\nI take what you got to give, cause I got to live\nThe last hour, I bet your ass in rack shower\nMight act up, but I still can pass Da'wah\nI'm using new ways to try to reach these better days\nInstead of tryna take you under I just make you wonder\nI still fast, make salaat and pay zakaat\nI didn't make Hajj yet, but that's my next project\nLiving two lives, one of turn and one with true lies\nKeeping up hope, knowing he's answering to my du'as\nIn the quarters living modest with my nigga Trotter\nI circle my foes, like tawwaf around the ka'ba\nI used to live life, like there was no ma\u00f1ana\nNow I'm treating every breath, like it was an honor\nI'm Mill-itill-itant with the Fifth that stand firm\nLike a pillar, I'm I and T-L like Manilla\n\nYo, the feet that I walk with\nThe ears that I hear with, the eyes that I see with\nThe mouth that I talk with, the terror that I stalk with\nNow it's time to spark shit\nYo, the feet that I walk with\nThe ears that I hear with, the eyes that I see with\nThe mouth that I talk with, the terror that I stalk with\nNow it's time to spark shit\n\nThis is what it's all about", "image": "https://images.genius.com/48bf85536a40e7f8612dfe0591beeb90.600x600x1.jpg", "artist": "The

with, the terror that I stalk with\nNow it's time to spark shit\n\nLook Ock, I walk around a little edgy already\nY'all MC's come into my face, but my aim's steady\nM-illitant is skilled in most strategic plan\nI float across seas and, breezed across land?\nStanding, in these thoughts of murder within\nDestructor of this world that's corrupted with sin\nI'm always hitting, to leave MC's guessing\nFor any transgression, in my perimeter\nThere will be a blessing, and your explicit intoxicated\nBuddha session, to stop stressing\nMe with the madness, putting niggas on my had list\nNo sadness is felt, you shuffled and your cards get dealt\nJim Carrey ass niggas start to melt\nImpact like a buckle bein' swung from off a belt\nAny help for shelter, when in the realms of a welter\nMy weight will tilt ya, hold alignments and change your filter\nMy attitude a product of society\nSo sometimes for gratitude, you know you can't rely on me\nNiggas eyeing me, with looks of they anxiety\nWondering what's in my heart, velocity or piety\nYo, it depends on which one, you bring to surface\nAt times I get trife, but what to worship is my purpose\nMalik B blend with the tree, to spot an enemy\nYou clogging me up cat, now vacate the vicinity\n\nYo, the feet that I walk with\nThe ears that I hear with, the eyes that I see with\nThe mouth that I talk with, the terror that I stalk with\nNow it's time to spark shit\nYo, the feet that I walk with\nThe ears that I hear with, the eyes that I see with\nThe mouth that I talk with, the terror that I stalk with\nNow it's time to spark shit\n\nI'm symbolic to a ballot, it's Abdul Malik\nDon't approach with bullshit, I'm quick to call it invalid\nRoute through your district, we keep it simplistic\nNo need for the rapper to talk, put it on halt\nShow me the vault, or the safe, cause I'm on the paper chase\nWade through route states for bout thirty down my waist\nI'm tryna get it, these rain bottling thoughts become acidic\nWith one in the chamber, ready to aim and spit it\nA girlfriend and team made nigga cash just splintered\nI take what you got to give, cause I got to live\nThe last hour, I bet your ass in rack shower\nMight act up, but I still can pass Da'wah\nI'm using new ways to try to reach these better days\nInstead of tryna take you under I just make you wonder\nI still fast, make salaat and pay zakaat\nI didn't make Hajj yet, but that's my next project\nLiving two lives, one of turn and one with true lies\nKeeping up hope, knowing he's answering to my du'as\nIn the quarters living modest with my nigga Trotter\nI circle my foes, like tawwaf around the ka'ba\nI used to live life, like there was no ma\u00f1ana\nNow I'm treating every breath, like it was an honor\nI'm Mill-itill-itant with the Fifth that stand firm\nLike a pillar, I'm I and T-L like Manilla\n\nYo, the feet that I walk with\nThe ears that I hear with, the eyes that I see with\nThe mouth that I talk with, the terror that I stalk with\nNow it's time to spark shit\nYo, the feet that I walk with\nThe ears that I hear with, the eyes that I see with\nThe mouth that I talk with, the terror that I stalk with\nNow it's

he drowned\nGot lost and found in her Tart Canal\nSlave to the waves, made him cum for days\nEighth and last One turn arise\nPlys her with familiar lies\nEven more familiar still, cause\nHim she used to love\nBut he never could quite see above, her mound\nA pound of flesh is all she was, no name no face or even voice\nSo poised, she rises -- Phoenix from the flame\nFinally bored with their feeble

life just living well\nI live life tryna tip the scale\nMy Way, my way\nMy Way, my way\n\nYo, I\u2019m always early, I never take off cause I got a job\nRob Peter to pay Paul\nNow I realize it\u2019s the winner that takes all\nDo what I gotta do because I can\u2019t take loss\nPicture me living life as if I\u2019m some animal\nThat consumes its own dreams like I\u2019m a cannibal\nI won\u2019t accept failure unless it\u2019s mechanical\nBut still the alcohol mixed with the botanical\nI guess I be referred to the owners manual full of loners\nFull of all the homeless throwaways and the stoners\nSoldiers of the streets with 8th grade diplomas\nAnd the world awaiting their shoulders as a bonus\nLook, let he without sin live without sin\nUntil then, I\u2019ll be doing dirty jobs like swamp men\nCounting the faces of those that might have been\nIt\u2019s like living that life but I won\u2019t live that life again\n\nHomicide or suicide\nHeads or Tails\nSome think life is a living hell\nSome live life just living well\nI live life tryna tip the scale\nMy Way, my way\nMy Way, my way\n\nLot of niggas go to prison, how many come out Malcolm X?\nI know I'm not, shit, can't even talk about the rest\nFamous last words: \"You under arrest\"\nWill I get popped tonight?

"Send a message to God in Heaven\nI'm thankful to be alive\nCause you sleep from 11 to 7\nAnd work hard from 9 to 5\nCause can't nobody last forever\nAnd everybody has to die\nAnd everybody needs protection\nI pray it don't pass me by\n\nCause everybody needs an angel\nAnd everybody needs to smile\nAnd everybody has an angle\nAnd everybody wants tomorrow right now\n\nSome say that happiness will never find you\nUntil you find yourself\nSome say that happiness is all around you\nIt ain't how you measure your wealth\nNo, I say it's free to be yourself\nWe all fall short sometimes\nIt costs nothing\nIt costs nothing to help sometimes\n\nCause everybody needs an angel\nAnd everybody needs to smile\nAnd everybody has an angle\nAnd everybody wants tomorrow right now\nBut everybody needs an angel\nAnd everybody needs to smile\nAnd everybody has an angle\nAnd everybody wants tomorrow right now\nAnd everybody wants tomorrow right now\nAnd everybody wants tomorrow right now\nNow\nNow\nNow"}}, {"title": "Understand", "album": "\u2026And Then You Shoot Your Cousin", "year": "2014-05-19", "lyrics": "Never understand\n\nPeople ask for God, 'till the day he comes\nSee God's face - turn around and run\nGod sees the face of a man\nShaking his head, says \"he'll never understand\"\nPeople ask for god, 'till the day he comes\nSee God's face - turn around and run\nGod sees the face of a man\nShakes his head then he says, \"man\u2019ll never understand\u201d\n\nNever understand, never understand\nNever understand\n\nGravedigger, dig a hole that fit a black nigga\nMy body's stiff as a Madame Tussaud's wax figure\nMy transformation: a caterpillar from crack dealer And backpedaller was no less, than spectactular\nYeah I was trappin' money, flippin' like a spatula\nNow put that sucker in a box like Dracula\nI led the devil in a dance\nAn electric slide across the line I drew up in the sand\nDead, ended\nLove is like a harlequin's romance\nLost between sips of liquor, that empty bottle in my hands\nIt was a shot away, but I never got away\nDreamed a little dream of me, but that was an anomaly\nYea, people ask for God...\n\nPeople ask for God, 'till the day he comes\nSee God's face - turn around and run\nGod sees the face of a man\nShaking his head, says \"he'll never understand\"\nPeople ask for god, 'till the day he comes\nSee God's face - turn around and run\nGod sees the face of a man\nShakes his head then he says, \"man\u2019ll never understand\u201d\n\nHoly, Sugar, Honey, Ice Tea\nI guess that's a prayer for a player like me\nIn my church clothes breaking buds on the Bible\nThe sweet temptation of my grand daddy's rifle\nGot me thinking 'bout doing a jihad with these guys\nWho only True Religion look better than Levi's\nWho baptize glasses with beers and blood stain\nYou preaching to the choir, that praise the drug game\nHallelujah\n'Til the cops cuff me in the back of a cruiser\nOr the firetruck wash my soul down the sewer\nI count my blessings and blow it on a nun to resurrect my erection\nI pray, I pray, All Dogs Go To Heaven\nOr to a new hell with a Wi-Fi connection\nSo I can pay for my sins on PayPal\nOr own a holy ghost, a greyhound\n\nPeople ask for God, 'till the day he comes\nSee God's face - turn around and run\nGod sees the face of a man\nShaking his head, says \"he'll never understand\"\nPeople ask for god, 'till the day he comes\nSee God's face - turn around and run\nGod sees the face of a man\nShakes his head then he says, \"man\u2019ll never understand\u201d", "image":

turn around and run\nGod sees the face of a man\nShaking his head, says \"he'll never understand\"\nPeople ask for god, 'till the day he comes\nSee God's face - turn around and run\nGod sees the face of a man\nShakes his head then he says, \"man\u2019ll never understand\u201d\n\nNever understand, never understand\nNever understand\n\nGravedigger, dig a hole that fit a black nigga\nMy body's stiff as a Madame Tussaud's wax figure\nMy transformation: a caterpillar from crack dealer And backpedaller was no less, than spectactular\nYeah I was trappin' money, flippin' like a spatula\nNow put that sucker in a box like Dracula\nI led the devil in a dance\nAn electric slide across the line I drew up in the sand\nDead, ended\nLove is like a harlequin's romance\nLost between sips of liquor, that empty bottle in my hands\nIt was a shot away, but I never got away\nDreamed a little dream of me, but that was an anomaly\nYea, people ask for God...\n\nPeople ask for God, 'till the day he comes\nSee God's face - turn around and run\nGod sees the face of a man\nShaking his head, says \"he'll never understand\"\nPeople ask for god, 'till the day he comes\nSee God's face - turn around and run\nGod sees the face of a man\nShakes his head then he says, \"man\u2019ll never understand\u201d\n\nHoly, Sugar, Honey, Ice Tea\nI guess that's a prayer for a player like me\nIn my church clothes breaking buds on the Bible\nThe sweet temptation of my grand daddy's rifle\nGot me thinking 'bout doing a jihad with these guys\nWho only True Religion look better than Levi's\nWho baptize glasses with beers and blood stain\nYou preaching to the choir, that praise the drug game\nHallelujah\n'Til the cops cuff me in the back of a cruiser\nOr the firetruck wash my soul down the sewer\nI count my blessings and blow it on a nun to resurrect my erection\nI pray, I pray, All Dogs Go To Heaven\nOr to a new hell with a Wi-Fi connection\nSo I can pay for my sins on PayPal\nOr own a holy ghost, a greyhound\n\nPeople ask for God, 'till the day he comes\nSee God's face - turn around and run\nGod sees the face of a man\nShaking his head, says \"he'll never understand\"\nPeople ask for god, 'till the day he comes\nSee God's face - turn around and run\nGod sees the face of a man\nShakes his head then he says, \"man\u2019ll never understand\u201d"}}, {"title": "Undun [Credits]", "album":

down\nYou know the business (Illtown illanoid)\nBringin it straight to your chest (comin thru with the iller category)\nYessah, hah, yeah (preacher man with the Com)\nBreak it down one two (we about to drop a bomb, check it)\n 2X\nWhen you and I verse at war (U.N.I.Verse at War)\nAnd your verse at core, for what you thought before\nSteppin up into a zone you should never explore\nThe next level or, level of the whole conceptor\n\nCheck it, rappers, get on the mic talkin' about cars and clothes\nSoundin' like hoes\nAin't been exposed to the foes, the most disciples\nI'm from the state that is ill, the rap son of man\nRotated down to Phil, to say what I feel\nGet it off my bird chest, my word becomes flesh\nWar, goin' on between the West and the East\nOf the lands, niggas don't own a piece\nGrease is the word, Murray slides some pimp oil to me\nMy lady friend sneaks my beer in the movie\nThrow your hands in the air, if you the true and livin'\nBeware, the new world order, the devil's new religion\nSent my homey to the number two division\nSellin' bootleg movies, got my VCR on a oove' smoove'\nBe at Fat Tuesday's, drinkin' tropical and just\nSittin' at a table with sophisticated bitches\nNah, that ain't nothin' I would call my mother\nNor do I call every nigga my brother\nGotta have Black Thought, it's sorta B like Malik\nSo don't Question a Brother, to the Roots I get deep\n\nYo, enter the last era\nYour scholarship into the world of politics and mascara\nWe operate within this artificial op-era\nI bring hip-hop terror like the Fuhrer\nThe Ace Ventura into the horror\nLaboratory laborer, venture beyond the border\nI'll struc-ture a style destroy your whole aura\nPlus your a-drenalin'll rise before your eyes\nImmortalize, my image in the skies\nDeceive the devil in disguise, my music, I parenthesize\nRepresent the wise, through this be how we enterprise\nKid, no compromise (yeah, yeah) I'm thinking fast like Rama-\nDan, I wear your mind away like Alzheimer\nI pull a mic up out my mama, big up to Bahama-\nDia, ayyo, this year we leavin' 'em in trauma\nThen after me, I plan to leave behind, the legacy\nOr history of the family, the Fifth Dynasty\nFor humanity, to bear witness to this\nDel-Val sylla-ble stylist\nYou know the time, kid\n 2X\n\nYo, the general flows, kids compose on tablet\nExpose how they was average and they thoughts not rapid\nHere comes the hot package, through your block like traffic\nThe rock was type graphic, now, watch the mic blast it\nShootin' at the stars with emphatic rap static\nSee the mirror shatter from thoughts, I'm busting back at it\nThe Lieuten-ant, the ele-phant, sippin' automatic\nMic, rippin' Asiatic, architects out to have it\nThe turn of the century, the planet's like a penitentiary\nExaggerated, niggas is livin' highly medicated\nI Used To Love Her but now she violated\nHip-hop holocaust and camps, old champs are concentrated\nThey outdated and incarcerated\nLoved and appreciated, hated and very debated\nFor every career created, one's eliminated\nAnd that's the way the balance of yin and yang is related, for real!\n\nEvery Block is divine\nNiggas swing on in a safari\nWild niggas, like I'm high on latari\nSome let the block, block they mind, if they could see what I see\nGet out the city for a sec be, at the places I be\nHey, I'ma be back on the deck, opening\nBusiness in places for you to cash your check\nMy, neck of the woods ain't all good ain't all bad\nYou can live in the 'burbs, and still get had\nThe sad part about it niggas had houses on the lake\nThey trying to move us out, the land we ain't appreciate\nFor peace we skate, crackers be rollerblading on hate\nCall each other cuz cause of how we relate\nI see way too many Cadillacs with dope-man plates\nThrough the wind and blow-ups, is how niggas communicate\nHarmonizing through beeper and reefer\nThe city got my peoples in a sleeper, talk is getting cheaper\n 4X", "image":

motherfucker\nWe gonna do this Chi-town style (verse at war)\nIlladelph, you know how we get down\nYou know the business (Illtown illanoid)\nBringin it straight to your chest (comin thru with the iller category)\nYessah, hah, yeah (preacher man with the Com)\nBreak it down one two (we about to drop a bomb, check it)\n 2X\nWhen you and I verse at war (U.N.I.Verse at War)\nAnd your verse at core, for what you thought before\nSteppin up into a zone you should never explore\nThe next level or, level of the whole conceptor\n\nCheck it, rappers, get on the mic talkin' about cars and clothes\nSoundin' like hoes\nAin't been exposed to the foes, the most disciples\nI'm from the state that is ill, the rap son of man\nRotated down to Phil, to say what I feel\nGet it off my bird chest, my word becomes flesh\nWar, goin' on between the West and the East\nOf the lands, niggas don't own a piece\nGrease is the word, Murray slides some pimp oil to me\nMy lady friend sneaks my beer in the movie\nThrow your hands in the air, if you the true and livin'\nBeware, the new world order, the devil's new religion\nSent my homey to the number two division\nSellin' bootleg movies, got my VCR on a oove' smoove'\nBe at Fat Tuesday's, drinkin' tropical and just\nSittin' at a table with sophisticated bitches\nNah, that ain't nothin' I would call my mother\nNor do I call every nigga my brother\nGotta have Black Thought, it's sorta B like Malik\nSo don't Question a Brother, to the Roots I get deep\n\nYo, enter the last era\nYour scholarship into the world of politics and mascara\nWe operate within this artificial op-era\nI bring hip-hop terror like the Fuhrer\nThe Ace Ventura into the horror\nLaboratory laborer, venture beyond the border\nI'll struc-ture a style destroy your whole aura\nPlus your a-drenalin'll rise before your eyes\nImmortalize, my image in the skies\nDeceive the devil in disguise, my music, I parenthesize\nRepresent the wise, through this be how we enterprise\nKid, no compromise (yeah, yeah) I'm thinking fast like Rama-\nDan, I wear your mind away like Alzheimer\nI pull a mic up out my mama, big up to Bahama-\nDia, ayyo, this year we leavin' 'em in trauma\nThen after me, I plan to leave behind, the legacy\nOr history of the family, the Fifth Dynasty\nFor humanity, to bear witness to this\nDel-Val sylla-ble stylist\nYou know the time, kid\n 2X\n\nYo, the general flows, kids compose on tablet\nExpose how they was average and they thoughts not rapid\nHere comes the hot package, through your block like traffic\nThe rock was type graphic, now, watch the mic blast it\nShootin' at the stars with emphatic rap static\nSee the mirror shatter from thoughts, I'm busting back at it\nThe Lieuten-ant, the ele-phant, sippin' automatic\nMic, rippin' Asiatic, architects out to have it\nThe turn of the century, the planet's like a penitentiary\nExaggerated, niggas is livin' highly medicated\nI Used To Love Her but now she violated\nHip-hop holocaust and camps, old champs are concentrated\nThey outdated and incarcerated\nLoved and appreciated, hated and very debated\nFor every career created, one's eliminated\nAnd that's the way the balance of yin and yang is related, for real!\n\nEvery Block is divine\nNiggas swing on in a safari\nWild niggas, like I'm high on latari\nSome let the block, block they mind, if they could see what I see\nGet out the city for a sec be, at the places I be\nHey, I'ma be back on the deck, opening\nBusiness in places for you to cash your check\nMy, neck of the woods ain't all good ain't all bad\nYou can live in the 'burbs, and still get had\nThe sad part about it niggas had houses on the lake\nThey trying to move us out, the land we ain't appreciate\nFor peace we skate, crackers be rollerblading on hate\nCall each other cuz cause of how we relate\nI see way too many Cadillacs with dope-man plates\nThrough the wind and blow-ups, is how niggas communicate\nHarmonizing through beeper and reefer\nThe city got my peoples in a sleeper, talk is getting cheaper\n 4X"}}, {"title": "Unwritten", "album": "Rising Down", "year": null, "lyrics": "When I think about the good times\nI think about

It gets deep, nigga\n\nYo, you need to walk straight, master your high\nSon you missin' out on was passing you by\nI done seen the streets suck a lot of cats dry\nBut not you and I, my nigga, we got to get\nCome on, over, over the water\nCome on, over, over the water\nWater, water...\n\nYo, we done been through many meals, a couple of deals\nWe done shared clothes and wheels, killed mics and reels\nWe done rocked shows abroad and slept on floors\nTrying to figure what the fuck we gettin' slept on for\nOr what we walking with the weapon for\nWeighted by the gravity law, you'd know it if you came up poor, my nigga\nPicture the bus up north, you know we made\nOf everything outlaws are made of, I'm far from a hater\nAnd I don't say I love you 'cause the way I feel is greater\nAnd M-Ila, you a poet, son, you a born creator\nAnd this'll probably dawn on you later, it's in your nature\nLyrics all on your walls like they made of paper\nYou got to find out where your talent take you\nYou might fuck around, finally make it, and that's real but, yo\n\nYo, you need to walk straight, master your high\nSon you missin' out on was passing you by\nI done seen the streets suck a lot of cats dry\nBut not you and I my nigga, we got to get\nCome on, over, over the water\nCome on, over, over the water\nWater, water...\n\nYo, I want you all to understand I come from South Philly\nAnd when I walk the street it's like a pharmacy\nThey got all type of shit anybody could get\nIt goes from H to X to loosie cigarettes\nFor my ghetto legend known for lil' sheist runnin'\nCopped codeine by the quarts and keep comin'\nDumbin, just embracing the dope like it's a woman\nYou burnin' both sides of the rope and just pullin'\nTuggin', in between Islam and straight thuggin'\nLaying everyday around the way and doin' nothin'\nSee'em looking shaking their head and start shruggin'\nIf they don't got a man like mine, they got a cousin\nAyo, you better be a true friend to him\nBefore the shit put an end to 'em, or give a pen to him\nOr lock him in the studio with a mic\n'Cause on the real, it might save his life\nKeep tellin' 'em!\n\nYo, you need to walk straight, master your high\nSon you missin' out on was passing you by\nI done seen the streets suck a lot of cats dry\nBut not you and I my nigga, we got to get\nCome on, over, over the water\nCome on, over, over the water\nWater, water...", "image": "https://images.genius.com/3b63864c76b254cbac7ffb7d3e83f789.600x600x1.jpg", "artist": "The Roots", "raw": {"annotation_count": 20, "api_path": "/songs/40481", "description": {"dom": {"tag": "root", "children": [{"tag": "p", "children": ["\u201cWater\u201d is the tenth track on 2002\u2019s ", {"tag": "a", "attributes": {"href": "https://genius.com/albums/The-roots/Phrenology"}, "data": {"api_path": "/albums/8806"}, "children": [{"tag": "em", "children": ["Phrenology"]}]}, ", the first Roots album to come out after original member ", {"tag": "a", "attributes": {"href": "https://genius.com/artists/Malik-b"}, "data": {"api_path": "/artists/2599"}, "children": ["Malik B"]}, " left the group due in part to drug problems. \u201cWater\u201d is basically an open letter from ", {"tag": "a", "attributes": {"href": "https://genius.com/artists/Black-thought"}, "data": {"api_path": "/artists/176"}, "children": ["Black Thought"]}, " to Malik B, reminding everybody how they met and how talented his friend \u201cSlacks\u201d was on the mic, and trying to explain how such a talented guy could get caught up in the drug temptations of South Philly \u2013 partly because The Roots had such a hard time breaking out of the underground.

record ain't nothing if it's not touching, gripping\nDraw you in closer, make you want to listen to it\nAnd if you real ill at making music\nThe listener feel like he livin' through it, that's how my nigga do it\nI met Slacks back in like, '91, rapping\nWe went to Millersville to get away from gun clappin'\nIt ain't last, I be in class dreaming 'bout\n50,000 fans up in the stands screaming out\n\"Encore!\" Yo, I'm headed back to Philly\nNigga you rollin' with me? I'm trying to get busy\nWe walked dogs that was off the chain\nLot of times, at the shows, people hardly came\nI just took it in stride as part of the game\nBut inside people down with me started to change\nIt was a couple things, lil' syrup, lil' pills\nInstead of riding out on the road you'd rather chill\nI know the way a pleasure feel, I'm not judging\nBut still I'm on a mission, yo, I'm not buggin'\nI got fam that can't stop druggin', they can't sleep\nThey can't stick to one subject, they can't eat\nIt's people steady comin' at me out in the street\nLike 'Riq, yo, what up with your peeps? It gets deep, nigga\n\nYo, you need to walk straight, master your high\nSon you missin' out on was passing you by\nI done seen the streets suck a lot of cats dry\nBut not you and I, my nigga, we got to get\nCome on, over, over the water\nCome on, over, over the water\nWater, water...\n\nYo, we done been through many meals, a couple of deals\nWe done shared clothes and wheels, killed mics and reels\nWe done rocked shows abroad and slept on floors\nTrying to figure what the fuck we gettin' slept on for\nOr what we walking with the weapon for\nWeighted by the gravity law, you'd know it if you came up poor, my nigga\nPicture the bus up north, you know we made\nOf everything outlaws are made of, I'm far from a hater\nAnd I don't say I love you 'cause the way I feel is greater\nAnd M-Ila, you a poet, son, you a born creator\nAnd this'll probably dawn on you later, it's in your nature\nLyrics all on your walls like they made of paper\nYou got to find out where your talent take you\nYou might fuck around, finally make it, and that's real but, yo\n\nYo, you need to walk straight, master your high\nSon you missin' out on was passing you by\nI done seen the streets suck a lot of cats dry\nBut not you and I my nigga, we got to get\nCome on, over, over the water\nCome on, over, over the water\nWater, water...\n\nYo, I want you all to understand I come from South Philly\nAnd when I walk the street it's like a pharmacy\nThey got all type of shit anybody could get\nIt goes from H to X to loosie cigarettes\nFor my ghetto legend known for lil' sheist runnin'\nCopped codeine by the quarts and keep comin'\nDumbin, just embracing the dope like it's a woman\nYou burnin' both sides of the rope and just pullin'\nTuggin', in between Islam and straight thuggin'\nLaying everyday around the way and doin' nothin'\nSee'em looking shaking their head and start shruggin'\nIf they don't got a man like mine, they got a cousin\nAyo, you better be a true friend to him\nBefore the shit put an end to 'em, or give a pen to him\nOr lock him in the studio with a mic\n'Cause on the real, it might save his life\nKeep tellin' 'em!\n\nYo, you need to walk straight, master your high\nSon you missin' out on was passing you by\nI done seen the streets suck a lot of cats dry\nBut not you and I my nigga, we got to get\nCome on, over, over the water\nCome on, over, over the water\nWater,

Philly, North Side\nOakland, Texas\nGeorgia, Black People\nYo, Worldwide, Sup my nigga\nYou know what I'm saying\nDumb and blind...\n\nThey say a record ain't nothing if it's not touching\nGripping, draw you in closer make you want to listen to it\nAnd if you real ill at making music\nThen lesson will feel like you livin' through it\nThat's how my nigga do it\nI met Slacks back in like '91 rapping\nWe went to Millersville to get away from gun clappin'\nIt ain't last\nI be in class dreaming 'bout\n50,000 fans up in the stands screaming out\nEncore, yo I'm headed back to Philly\nNigga you rollin' with me?\nI'm trying to get busy\nWe walk dogs that was off the chain\nLot of times at the show people hardly came\nI just took it in stride as part of the game\nBut inside people down with me started to change\nIt was a couple things\nLil' , lil' pills\nInstead of driving out on the road you rather chill\nI know the way the pleasure feel\nI'm not judging\nBut still I'm on a mission, yo I'm not buggin'\nI got fam that won't stop druggin'\nThey can't sleep\nThey can't stick to one subject, they can't eat\nIs people steady comin' at me out in the streets\nLike Riq yo wat up with your peeps\nIt gets deep nigga\n\nYo, you need to walk straight, master your high\nSon you missin' out on was passing you by\nI done seen the streets suck a lot of cats dry\nBut not you and I my nigga\nWe got to get\nCome on, over over the water\nCome on, over over the water\nWater, Water...\n\nYo, we done made too many meals\nA couple of deals\nWe done share clothes and wills\nKilled mics and reels\nWe done rock\nShows abroad, and slept on floors\nTrying to figga what the fuck we gettin' slept on for\nOh why we walking with the rep up for\nWaited by the cavity law\nYou know it if you came up poor my nigga\nPicture a bus up north\nYou know we made of everything outlaws are made of\nI'm far from a hater\nAnd I don't say I love you 'cause the way I feel is greater\nIn Illa you a poet son\nYou a ball creator\nAnd this will probably dawn on you later\nIs in you nature, letters all up in the wall like they made of paper\nYou got to find out where you talent take you\nYou might fuck around, finally make it\nAnd that's real but yo\n\n\nYo, I want you all to understand I come from South Philly\nAnd when I walk the street is like a pharmacy\nThey got all type of shit\nAnybody could get\nIt goes from H to Ex\nTo lucy ciggarette\nFor my ghetto legend\nKnown from Lil' shyst running\nCop codeine by the courts and keep comin'\nDummy, just embracing the dope like it's a woman\nYou burnin' both sides of the rope and keep pullin'\nTuggin', in between Islam and straight tuggin'\nLaying everyday around the way and doin' nothin'\nSee'em looking shaking their head and start shruggin'\nIf they don't have a man like mine, they got a cousin\nHey yo you better be a true friend to 'em\nBefore the shit put an end to 'em\nOr give a pen to 'em\nOr lock'em up in the studio with a mic\n'Cause on the real it might save his life\nKeep tellin'em"}}, {"title": "Web", "album": "The Tipping Point", "year": "2004-07-13", "lyrics": "Uh huh\nUh\nAnd it weighs a ton\n'riq Geez motherfuckers I'm a son of a gun\nBlack master of any trade under the sun\nTalk sharp like a razor blade under the tongue\nClear my path and come get your captain hung\nTrying to breathe like Black'll collapse your lungs\nYoung chump you could choke off the web I spun\nI done cleared 'em out from the threat I brung\nYou done heard about what set I'm from\nMy nigga, word of mouth little rule-a-thumb\nY'all better bow down when the ruler come\nI'm a real hood nigga not a hood-a-lum\nThe way Thought put it down be confusin' some of y'all\nCats can't walk while chewin' your gum 'n all\nWhat a keyboard got to do with a drum and all\nSchool 'em on stage like I'm doin' a seminar\nProfessional type, I'm adjustin' my mic\nGo to war kid I'll give you any weapon you like\nGive you something to run from, bust off your dum-dums\nStop kid, that hot shit you know where it come from\nIt's Philly world-wide phenomenon\nAnd reinforcin' that shit is my 9-to-5\nAnd when I finish making you recognize\nI'm getin' at a couple civilized women that's tryin' to ride\nYou been waitin' on the boul to come off to all\nYou wanna get the bitches up off the wall\nJust to see you smile and enjoy yourself\nTo keep you in health, this for all of y'all\nI'm quick on the draw like Black McGraw\nAnd I can't tell what y'all cats rappin' for\nMy name 'riq Geez and I'm back for more\nTo get more chips than the corner store\nWith a portrait of Malcom X on the door\nWhile I'm eatin' MCs like a carnivore\nMatter fact, ease back 'fore you get harmed\nRing the warning horn when I'm gon' perform\nThe first nigga that move, or disturb the goove\nI'mma have y'all flicks on the evening news\nPlay y'all part - get on y'all P's and Q's\nAnd when y'all face Thought, be prepared to lose\nBring money to spend and somebody to lend\nAnd some worthwhile money not twenties and tens\nGet took for your tuck right in front of your hens\nWho coulda helped you, nigga? not none of ya friends\nBecause, I put a black fist under ya chin\nHave your physical remains found under the pen\nIf I'm coming up in the place, I'm coming to win\nWasn't in it for a minute, now I'm dumbin' again\n'riq Geez, akh, y'all can chat what y'all please\nReceive what I'm gonna get back to y'all believe\n'cuz you don't really wanna get clapped with all these\nMy man, you can take y'all strap when y'all leave\nYou see the squad come in the place, they all freeze\nIce Cold, with his mellow Cool Breeze\nMCs never showed loyalty yet\nKool Herc ain't never get a royalty check\nI do work, no question, and bomb your set\nI'm calm collect, sharp like my name Gillette\nRIP my man Gillette until I touch the mic\nY'all people ain't seen danger yet\nI'm a decorated vet, I regulate and wreck\nNever hesitated yet, I'm gettin' heavy weighted checks\nIf you would dare ask if I'm dedicated - yes\nI spit live rounds that'll penetrate a vest\nNigga, take ya seats I'm a demonstrate a test\nHow to freak the beats, so gangsta fresh\nAnd it thump, from the east coast to Bangladesh\nBig bank Willy Gank smoke the thing to death\nBut hold tight, cuz it's not over yet\nI don't even feel like I'm not sober yet\nAnd it ring like shots in the projects New Year's Eve\nAnd it ain't even October yet\nI'm a big bounty hunter like Boba Fett\nY'all more shell shocked then a soldier get\nIf the prize in my sights then I'm goin' for this\nWhoo whoo 'riq Geez be the ultimate\nI'm the culprit, give me the bulk of this\n'riq set it on the magnetic ultra tip\nGet down how you 'posed to get\nI got nothing to lose, I'm a killer with no regrets\nI'm like young LL, cuz I'm hard as hell\nMakin' niggas screw face like Gargamel\nNow I'm all out on my own like Patti LaBelle\nPut the pimp game down

arts, when the listening start\nOpen your head wide, and let the Thought inside\nMy style fortified by all of Philadelphi\nMy delph more stealth than all the wicked wealthy\nMentality undetectable by the naked eye\nThen I get paid when the record is played\nTo put it short \"I want it made\" like Ed, nuff said\nThen after that, I'm putting on my cousin Hamed\nWe let the ladies blend with the

in for so long you bursted into tears\nThe letters spilled slowly across the page like a world premiere\nWell I ain't, the bullshit begins here\nThe obvious cause, the effects is unclear\nThe punishment for crimes of the heart could be severe\nThough to keep it on the low is a heavy cross to bear\nYou deep now, submerged with no signs of air\nStill your sunken heart thumpin like the kick in a snare\nWhile on the surface it's all turnin to a circus\nThat's why you're nervous, and you got a right to be\nCause if somebody would've done that shit to me\nI mean my best man hittin my wife-to-be\nMy sentiments exactly would be history\nY'know what I'm sayin? My peoples in the place let's hit it off, one two\n\nYo, it's like nothing changed, it's all the same thing\nThe same characters in a book, with different names\nIt's a lot more to lose than you got to gain\nYou a lot more confused than hip to the game\nThe peep the script of the game the price is pain\nMen and women get into things, now who's to blame?\nWhen everybody whispering bout whatever took place\nAnd how the fact twist a knot with a straight face\nAnd lies, hard to swallow from the bitter taste\nWell that's a point in the past that can't be erased\nSo motivate, though it's hard to let it ride\nOr set aside true feelings, underhand dealings\nOur lost trust, I wonder if we lost us\nIt's bigger than me and you, it's monstrous\nSo I'ma, just calm down and try to relax\nBefore I clap the hammer ???? , one two\n\nIf you could only flash back and undo our actions\nChange what happens, dissect the fractions\nA time to rewind and be recorded absent\nFor real cause these memories is photographic\nPornographic, pushing me close to madness\nHead heavy like I'm tripping on acid tablets\nYesterday as I recall was all fabulous I thought so\nBut now it feel like shots hittin my torso\nSpent a lot of time and trust in the wrong place\nFought a lot of fights rolling with the wrong ace\nLove, stronger than pride, we could end disgrace\nI need, room the think, and space to ventilate\nWas solid as a rock, shall not disintegrate\nThoughts racing like the lunatics on the interstate\nFor real, ya, it's ill, ya, my peoples in the place...", "image":

you more\nOf what you're looking for\nSo it's a secret that's been pent up inside for years\nExclusive type, only for your eyes and ears\nYou held it in for so long you bursted into tears\nThe letters spilled slowly across the page like a world premiere\nWell I ain't, the bullshit begins here\nThe obvious cause, the effects is unclear\nThe punishment for crimes of the heart could be severe\nThough to keep it on the low is a heavy cross to bear\nYou deep now, submerged with no signs of air\nStill your sunken heart thumpin like the kick in a snare\nWhile on the surface it's all turnin to a circus\nThat's why you're nervous, and you got a right to be\nCause if somebody would've done that shit to me\nI mean my best man hittin my wife-to-be\nMy sentiments exactly would be history\nY'know what I'm sayin? My peoples in the place let's hit it off, one two\n\nYo, it's like nothing changed, it's all the same thing\nThe same characters in a book, with different names\nIt's a lot more to lose than you got to gain\nYou a lot more confused than hip to the game\nThe peep the script of the game the price is pain\nMen and women get into things, now who's to blame?\nWhen everybody whispering bout whatever took place\nAnd how the fact twist a knot with a straight face\nAnd lies, hard to swallow from the bitter taste\nWell that's a point in the past that can't be erased\nSo motivate, though it's hard to let it ride\nOr set aside true feelings, underhand dealings\nOur lost trust, I wonder if we lost us\nIt's bigger than me and you, it's monstrous\nSo I'ma, just calm down and try to relax\nBefore I clap the hammer ???? , one two\n\nIf you could only flash back and undo our actions\nChange what happens, dissect the fractions\nA time to rewind and be recorded absent\nFor real cause these memories is photographic\nPornographic, pushing me close to madness\nHead heavy like I'm tripping on acid tablets\nYesterday as I recall was all fabulous I thought so\nBut now it feel like shots hittin my torso\nSpent a lot of time and trust in the wrong place\nFought a lot of fights rolling with the wrong ace\nLove, stronger than pride, we could end disgrace\nI need, room the think, and space to ventilate\nWas solid as a rock, shall not disintegrate\nThoughts racing like the lunatics on the interstate\nFor real, ya, it's ill, ya, my peoples in the place..."}}, {"title": "When The People Cheer", "album": "\u2026And Then You Shoot Your Cousin", "year": "2014-04-07", "lyrics": "Lights, camera, chemical reaction\nAttracted to a body of lies with fat asses\nThank the most high for the high of high fashion\nMy art of war is killer couture, denim assassin\n\nAm I, am I a douche bag or just another doo-rag?\nTryin' get ahead on some brand new-wave shit\nFor your entertainment money is the language\nSo every time I speak I\u2019m tryin' to make another payment\nI do \u2018em dirty, sleep and get a dirt nap, that works\n'Til my P.O. ask me where I work at\nThink I would learned that sleeping in the bird trap\nLiving on the run like somebody tryin' burn fat\nI don\u2019t give a fuck, now maybe that\u2019s abstinence\nOr the arrogance of someone who ain\u2019t got shit\nThat think money over bitches is a stock tip\u2026\n\nI live in a trap where things go crack\nWake up in the boxes with a box of Apple Jacks\nEverybody acts like God is all that\nBut I got the feelin\u2019 he ain\u2019t never coming back\nSo I got an angel that answer my prayer\nFloating on the cloud that I blow in the air\nNobody wins but nobody cares\nThey just want blood when the people cheer\n\nI\u2019m down to 95 dollars, that\u2019s the extent of my riches\nOut of 99 problems, 98 of \u2018em is bitches\nOut here hollerin' what\u2019s ironic is\nI\u2019ve honestly been tryna do what\u2019s right\nBut some jawn legs in the air tonight, like Phil Collins\nI\u2019m a sex-addicted introvert\nSucker for a pencil skirt\nLooking for a shorty coming from work, that I can pervert\nOn my existential grind doing consequential dirt\nSearchin\u2019 for physical pleasure if I don\u2019t go mental first\nMolly poppin\u2019, trolley hoppin\u2019\nKnow somebody prolly watchin\u2019\nThat ain\u2019t stoppin\u2019 me from coppin\u2019 a feel\nKarate choppin\u2019 in this after-hours spot\nWatching mommy body rockin\u2019\nFirst I feed her vodka shots then she eat my Johnnie Cochran\nLivin\u2019 fast, drinkin\u2019 capt'\nOne of them hoes even had\nThe audacity ask me how long this thing would last\nI said, \u201cYou wanna pay for class?\nGet on that stage and shake your ass.\u201d\nShe keep a dick in a box\nAnd \"in an emergency, break the glass\"\nI make her laugh\nShe makes it clap\nAnd then she gives me lap dances and I\u2019m thankful that\nShe keeps providing the place for me to be unfaithful at\n\nI live in a trap where things go crack\nWake up in the boxes with a box of Apple Jacks\nEverybody acts like God is all that\nBut I got the feelin\u2019 he ain\u2019t never coming back\nSo I got an angel that answer my prayer\nFloating on the cloud that I blow in the air\nNobody wins but nobody cares\nThey just want blood when the people cheer", "image": "https://images.rapgenius.com/9fb660a6d810172dd3ef9cd81729eb83.500x500x1.jpg", "artist": "The Roots", "raw": {"annotation_count": 37, "api_path": "/songs/398119", "description": {"dom": {"tag": "root", "children": [{"tag": "p", "children": ["Ladies and gentlemen, ", {"tag": "em", "children": ["The Legendary Roots Crew"]}, " \u2026 is back, once again."]}, "", {"tag": "p", "children": [{"tag": "img", "attributes": {"src": "https://images.rapgenius.com/cc6b278695c20e9e3233d9f273f93b6c.426x291x1.jpg", "alt": "", "width": 426, "height": 291}, "data": {"animated": "false", "thumbnail": {"src": "https://images.rapgenius.com/cc6b278695c20e9e3233d9f273f93b6c.300x205x1.jpg", "height": 205, "width": 300}}}]}, "", {"tag": "p", "children": ["It had been a busy few years for The Roots following the release of their critically acclaimed album ", {"tag": "a", "attributes": {"href": "https://genius.com/albums/The-roots/Undun"}, "data": {"api_path": "/albums/12724"}, "children": [{"tag": "em", "children": ["Undun"]}]}, " in 2011.

I a douche bag or just another doo-rag?\nTryin' get ahead on some brand new-wave shit\nFor your entertainment money is the language\nSo every time I speak I\u2019m tryin' to make another payment\nI do \u2018em dirty, sleep and get a dirt nap, that works\n'Til my P.O. ask me where I work at\nThink I would learned that sleeping in the bird trap\nLiving on the run like somebody tryin' burn fat\nI don\u2019t give a fuck, now maybe that\u2019s abstinence\nOr the arrogance of someone who ain\u2019t got shit\nThat think money over bitches is a stock tip\u2026\n\nI live in a trap where things go crack\nWake up in the boxes with a box of Apple Jacks\nEverybody acts like God is all that\nBut I got the feelin\u2019 he ain\u2019t never coming back\nSo I got an angel that answer my prayer\nFloating on the cloud that I blow in the air\nNobody wins but nobody cares\nThey just want blood when the people cheer\n\nI\u2019m down to 95 dollars, that\u2019s the extent of my riches\nOut of 99 problems, 98 of \u2018em is bitches\nOut here hollerin' what\u2019s ironic is\nI\u2019ve honestly been tryna do what\u2019s right\nBut some jawn legs in the air tonight, like Phil Collins\nI\u2019m a sex-addicted introvert\nSucker for a pencil skirt\nLooking for a shorty coming from work, that I can pervert\nOn my existential grind doing consequential dirt\nSearchin\u2019 for physical pleasure if I don\u2019t go mental first\nMolly poppin\u2019, trolley hoppin\u2019\nKnow somebody prolly watchin\u2019\nThat ain\u2019t stoppin\u2019 me from coppin\u2019 a feel\nKarate choppin\u2019 in this after-hours spot\nWatching mommy body rockin\u2019\nFirst I feed her vodka shots then she eat my Johnnie Cochran\nLivin\u2019 fast, drinkin\u2019 capt'\nOne of them hoes even had\nThe audacity ask me how long this thing would last\nI said, \u201cYou wanna pay for class?\nGet on that stage and shake your ass.\u201d\nShe keep a dick in a box\nAnd \"in an emergency, break the glass\"\nI make her laugh\nShe makes it clap\nAnd then she gives me lap dances and I\u2019m thankful that\nShe keeps providing the place for me to be unfaithful at\n\nI live in a trap where things go crack\nWake up in the boxes with a box of Apple Jacks\nEverybody acts like God is all that\nBut I got the feelin\u2019 he ain\u2019t never coming back\nSo I got an angel that answer my

lives who dies who tells your story\n\nMy mind flashes, I see the ashes of the masters\nWho touch the masses, I ask if I'll ever be one\nWhen I die, will heaven be done?\nWhat will my legend become?\nI will forever be young\nThrough old tales of breakdancing down at Odell's\nStreets named after me is where my soul dwells\nDesires of a church choir, Trinity United\nI think of good memories that Hennessy provided\nMemories divided by perception\nWill it be Water for Chocolate or Resurrection?\nThe path to perfection is rarely achieved\nI head in that direction, I dream and believe\nAn underground dude that overachieve\nFrom the windy city I was blowing they eaves\nSomewhere along the way I aired out MCs\n(Who lives who dies who tells your story)\nBut to stand out some days you may freeze\nDegrees\n\nWho lives\nAnd who dies\nWho holds on to all our lives?\nTime and time and time again\nWill they tell your story in the end\n(Who lives who dies who tells your story?)\n\nYo, the anticipation arose as time froze\nThe black men in the morgue were John Does\nLynched for whistling at blonde does\nI said a prayer with my eyes closed\nAs I loaded the Roscoe's at the sink, yo\nI been a bullet on the brink\nBut being a young king\nProbably different than you think, though\nThe quills that I dip into the ink go to document\nAnd you'll remember me when I'm extinct\nYo, sing the carol of a young pharaoh\nWho slew Leviathan with one arrow\nAs I revolve through the gun barrel just to watch it unravel\nI tell them have heart, must travel\nKeep my legacy alive even if I don't survive 'til the curtain call\nFirst of all, realize what we working towards\nFuck around, find what we searching for\n(Who lives who dies who tells your story?)\nThe earth, my name written in cursive form\n\nWho lives\nAnd who dies\nWho holds on to all our lives?\nTime and time and time again\nWill they tell your story in the end\n(Who lives who dies who tells your story?)\n\nWho lives\nAnd who dies\nWho holds on to our lives?\nTime and time and time again\nWill they tell your story in the end?\n(Who lives who dies who tells your story?)\n\nFrozen in time, I can't let it go\nNat Cole, Unforgettable\nThe pedestal I'm on, I'mma end up on the Federal\nReserve note your money with a hip hop quote\nI might change legislation with some shit that I wrote\nFrom boats that we came on to lights with our name on\nThrough hard times, we spark minds to keep the flame on\nI write hard rhymes like I'm running out of time\nTruthfully, my stopwatch\u200b is one with the divine\nCenturies from now, they'll play my freestyle\nAnd say, this is the brilliance of a Black American child\nEndowed by the streets, and the Chi proud\nKnown to move in silence, but can be loud\nThe noise of beat girls and boys\nBuilding to destroy the perception of urban aggression\nMy life is a progression of chords, wrote the oppressors\nA chorus, my story is the glory of the lord\n\nWho lives (who lives)\nAnd who dies (who dies)\nWho holds on to all our lives?\nTime and time and time again\nWill they tell your story in the end?\n(Who lives who dies who tells your story?)", "image":

da-da-da-dum)\nThis is the story of a\nWho lives who dies who tells your story\n\nMy mind flashes, I see the ashes of the masters\nWho touch the masses, I ask if I'll ever be one\nWhen I die, will heaven be done?\nWhat will my legend become?\nI will forever be young\nThrough old tales of breakdancing down at Odell's\nStreets named after me is where my soul dwells\nDesires of a church choir, Trinity United\nI think of good memories that Hennessy provided\nMemories divided by perception\nWill it be Water for Chocolate or Resurrection?\nThe path to perfection is rarely achieved\nI head in that direction, I dream and believe\nAn underground dude that overachieve\nFrom the windy city I was blowing they eaves\nSomewhere along the way I aired out MCs\n(Who lives who dies who tells your story)\nBut to stand out some days you may freeze\nDegrees\n\nWho lives\nAnd who dies\nWho holds on to all our lives?\nTime and time and time again\nWill they tell your story in the end\n(Who lives who dies who tells your story?)\n\nYo, the anticipation arose as time froze\nThe black men in the morgue were John Does\nLynched for whistling at blonde does\nI said a prayer with my eyes closed\nAs I loaded the Roscoe's at the sink, yo\nI been a bullet on the brink\nBut being a young king\nProbably different than you think, though\nThe quills that I dip into the ink go to document\nAnd you'll remember me when I'm extinct\nYo, sing the carol of a young pharaoh\nWho slew Leviathan with one arrow\nAs I revolve through the gun barrel just to watch it unravel\nI tell them have heart, must travel\nKeep my legacy alive even if I don't survive 'til the curtain call\nFirst of all, realize what we working towards\nFuck around, find what we searching for\n(Who lives who dies who tells your story?)\nThe earth, my name written in cursive form\n\nWho lives\nAnd who dies\nWho holds on to all our lives?\nTime and time and time again\nWill they tell your story in the end\n(Who lives who dies who tells your story?)\n\nWho lives\nAnd who dies\nWho holds on to our lives?\nTime and time and time again\nWill they tell your story in the end?\n(Who lives who dies who tells your story?)\n\nFrozen in time, I can't let it go\nNat Cole, Unforgettable\nThe pedestal I'm on, I'mma end up on the Federal\nReserve note your money with a hip hop quote\nI might change legislation with some shit that I wrote\nFrom boats that we came on to lights with our name on\nThrough hard times, we spark minds to keep the flame on\nI write hard rhymes like I'm running out of time\nTruthfully, my stopwatch\u200b is one with the divine\nCenturies from now, they'll play my freestyle\nAnd say, this is the brilliance of a Black American child\nEndowed by the streets, and the Chi proud\nKnown to move in silence, but can be loud\nThe noise of beat girls and boys\nBuilding to destroy the perception of urban aggression\nMy life is a progression of chords, wrote the oppressors\nA chorus, my story is the glory of the lord\n\nWho lives (who lives)\nAnd who dies (who dies)\nWho holds on to all our lives?\nTime and time and time again\nWill they tell your story in the end?\n(Who lives who dies who tells your

I tried to tell them in Clones\nYou can't sign from the next man's skill\nI got style half sex appeal and half trife\nMy voice is like a soul nigga on a bagpipe\nBefore we got on stage and got things hype\nYou was boring the crowd performing the last rites\nNow let me show you how this shit is done\nIt's Black Thought and Questlove on the drum, he the big one\nAnd you about to be the victim, because Mars dog\nMurking with the ham and he thirsty to hit son\nIt ain't nothing but rhymes and ammunition\nFor all y'all dopes with hopes and ambitions\nOf knocking me off and trying to take my position\nStop wishing and sit your ass back and listen\nTo the yo you rocking with the number one best\nNo one for contest. Come on, work\n\n\nYo I want action baby black cherry Cadillac traction\nSmack shit up you won't know what the fuck happened\nThug, you light on the thug and heavy on the passion\nIn South Philly son there's heavy gun traffic\nYo I got seven joints, every one a classic sound\nDown for the long stretch like elastic\nCatch this, if I'm in the box selling blast or shot\nMy thing is pro hip hop and pro blackness\nThe whole block got straps and throwbacks\nBut yo sometimes it just contributes to the madness\nWe live around wild hazards. The bait is\nLike a magnet and grown ass kids they want to have it\nTheir hearts pumping overactive in front of their eyes\nIt's so elaborate, ghetto melodramatic\nYo I lift it up and come through in the clutch\nBut y'all came here to do it or what? I keep telling you that\nIt just ain't real without Roots crew in it\nTo black people getting money keep doing it\nAnd to whoever will front you know what you can get\nUh get the fuck out of here with that stupid shit"}}, {"title": "Writer's Block", "album": "Organix", "year": null, "lyrics": "(Black Thought)\nOooh\nUp, up.. up, up..

dark denim, with a soft spot for smart women\nGreen trees and white linen\nThe Black Thought was a monster from the beginnin\nRiq spit venom, raw core shit I pinnin\nIt's my time and it's long

see everything you wanna be\nSee, you're gamin as a key to escape poverty\nKnown to be shown around, sported by the niggas\nThinkin' you a woman cause your ass got bigger\nKickin' it to me as if I don't know the time\nBut I'm the Black Thought, I'm all up in your mind\nI figure you the kind to say, \"Give me a call\"\nBut then switch to act strange, countin' all my change\nPay to the order of

known\nSee, I'm not your every five minutes all on the phone\nAnd on the topic of trust, it's just a matter of fact\nThat people bite back and fracture what's intact\nAnd they'll forever be, I ain't on some \"Oh, I'm a celebrity!\"\nI deal with the real, so if it's artificial, let it be\nI've seen people caught in love like whirlwinds\nListening to their squads and listening to girlfriends\nThat's exactly the point where their whole world ends\nLies come in, that's where that drama begins, and she like\u2026\n\nIf you were worried 'bout where\nI been or who I saw or\nWhat

this Ethiopian queen from Philly taking classes abroad\nShe studying film and photo, flash, focus, record\nSaid she working on a flick and could my clique do the score\nShe said she loved my show in Paris at Elysee Montmartre\nAnd that I stepped off the stage and took a piece of her heart\nWe knew from the start that things fall apart\nAnd tend to shatter, she like, \"That shit don't matter.\"\nWhen I get home, get at her\nThrough letter, phone, whatever; let's link, let's get together\nShit, you think not, think the Thought went home and forgot?\nTime passed, we back in Philly, now she up in my spot\nTelling me the things I'm telling her is making her hot\nStarting building with her constantly round-the-clock\nNow she in my world like hip-hop, and keep telling me\u2026\n\nIf you were worried 'bout where\nI been or who I saw or\nWhat club I went to with my homies\nBaby, don't worry\nYou know that you got me\n\nYo, I'm the type that's always catching a flight\nAnd sometimes

taking classes abroad\nShe studying film and photo, flash, focus, record\nSaid she working on a flick and could my clique do the score\nShe said she loved my show in Paris at Elysee Montmartre\nAnd that I stepped off the stage and took a piece of her heart\nWe knew from the start that things fall apart, intentions shatter\nShe like that shit don't matter when I get home get at her\nThrough letter, phone whatever, let's link, let's get together\nShit you think not, think the Thought went home and forgot\nTime passed, we back in Philly now she up in my spot\nTelling me the things I'm telling her is making her hot\nStarting building with her constantly round the clock\nNow she in my world like hip-hop and keep telling me\n\nIf you were worried bout where\nI been or who I saw or\nWhat club I went to with my homies\nBaby don't worry you know that you got me\nIf you were worried bout where\nI been or who I saw or\nWhat club I went to with my homies\nBaby don't worry you know that you got me\n\nYo I'm the type that's always catching a flight\nAnd sometimes I gotta be out at the height of the night\nAnd that's when she flip and get on some 'ol\n\n...Another lonely night\nSeem like I'm on the side you only loving your mic\nI know you gotta get that paper Daddy keep that shit tight\nBut yo I need some sort of love in my life, you dig me\nWhile politicking with my sister from New York City\nShe said she know this ball player and he think I'm pretty\nPsych, I'm playing boo, you know it's just wit you I'm staying boo\nAnd when cats be popping game I don't hear what they sayin boo\nWhen you out there in the world I'm still your girl\nWith all my classes I don't have the time for life's thrills\nSo when you sweating on stage think of me when you rhyme\nAnd don't be listening to your homies, they be leaving you blind\n\nYeah, so what you sayin I can trust you?\n\nIs you crazy, you my king for real\n\nBut sometimes relationships get ill\n\nNo doubt\n\n\nThat snake could be that chick and that rat could be that cool cat\nThat's whispering she trying to play you for the fool Black\nIf something's on your chest then let it be known\nSee I'm not at you every five minutes all on the phone\nAnd on the topic of trust, it's just a matter of fact\nThat people bite back and fracture what's intact\nAnd they'll forever be, I ain't on some oh I'm a celebrity\nI deal with the real, so if it's artificial let it be\nI've seen people caught in love like whirlwinds\nListening to they squads and listening to girlfriends\nThat's exactly the point where their whole world ends\nLies come in, that's where that drama begins, and she like"}}], "artist": "The Roots"}
