know (IGH! Huh!)\n\nSaid I'm livin' my best life\nSaid I'm livin' my best life\nMade a couple M's with my best friends\nTurned all my L's into lessons\nYou see the whip pullin' up, it's like \"skrrt\"\nDreams pullin' up, I'm like \"skrrt\"\nI'm livin' my best life\nIt's my birthday, at least that's what I'm dressed like\n\nI'm like Big Pop' mixed with 2Pac, I'm like Makaveli (yeah)\nYou need some, Little Caesar's pizza, I be hot and ready (woo)\nNigga, you a pussy and a rat, you like Tom and Jerry\nNigga, you ain't ballin', you just talkin', that's that commentary (huh)\nI was in the field, man, I slaved for this (yeah)\nHad to talk to God, dropped down, and prayed for this\nTo my surprise, He replied, said, \"You made for this\"\nI seen the car I wanted, then I went and paid for it, cash cash\nHit the Tay-K, I hit the race, hit the dash dash\nThat's when they came for me on Twitter with the backlash\n\"#CardiBIsSoProblematic\" is the hashtag\nI can't believe they wanna see me lose that bad\nThey talkin' junk and they stink, these hoes mad trash\nI'm gigglin', can't let the devil have the last laugh\nAin't no more beefin', I'm just keepin' to myself\nI'm my own competition, I'm

what I'm dressed like (Chance, The Rapper)\n\nYou don't like money, I can see it your eye\nYou don't like winnin', I can see it in your tie\nBetter be careful with these women when you trickin', send it fly\nShe count money in her sleep and she don't ever spend the night\nBut she trappin' and she had to make it happen for her life\nDon't be mad because she havin', shit, you had it your whole life\nWe had baggage on our flight, we had badges on our asses\nYou got passes in your life, you had gadgets on your bike\nGod work magic, God work magic, God work magic in my life\nAnd that guap look like Iyanla cause that bag just fixed my life\nHey, y'all know good and damn well I don't want no champagne\nBut can we please get some more champagne?\nPlease, no Andre, G like 'Venchy\nReach like 'Bron James, pep talk from Yonc\u00e9\n'Member my hands had ash like Pompeii\nNow they hold cash, won't peak like Dante\n\nI told y'all, I said I'm livin' my best life\nI told y'all, I said I'm livin'

it's filthy\nWay-before-the-deal me, strip-to-pay-the-bills me\n'Fore I fixed my teeth, man, those comments used to kill me\nBut never did I change, never been ashamed\nNever did I switch, story stayed the same\nI did this on my own, I made this a lane\nY'all gotta bear with me, I been through some things\nWent from small-ass apartments to walkin' red carpets\nPissy elevators, now every dress is tailored\nThis some real-life fairy tale Binderella shit\nI got further than them hoes said I will ever get\nAnd that only goes to show that only God knows\nI took pictures with Beyonc\u00e9, I met Mama Knowles\nI'm the rose that came from the concrete in the Rolls\nI'm like gold, I'm life goals, man, I'm chosen, I'm floatin', ayy\n\nI told y'all, I said I'm livin' my best life\nI told y'all, I

ain't com to take no photo\nI don't even pull up in a four door\nI just hit a lick, hit the load though\nAll my life smokin' on JoJo\nHe was just posted up with dough though\nNow he gettin' slammed by the popo\nThuggish, buggish, ruggish shit\nI can't leave the streets, I love this shit\nNever gave a shit 'bout a messy bitch\nI ain't never take a risk for a petty lick\nI'm at Digital Heights and I'm goin' on a heist\nDead presidents, John Kennedy\nDead presidents, pockets Mount Everest\nWhen I step on the scene it's a felony (yeah, yeah)\nChristian Louboutin (yeah)\nThese ain't Louis Vuittons (huh)\nHit a Kodak Bop on nae nae\nI wanna top me a Nae Nae\nNow I'm in a white whip, no mayonnaise\nStole a new car for me, Audi A8\nCardi B brought the beat, told me re-rock the heat\nTry me, I'll do the race like I'm Tay-K\nIt ain't no flockin' over here, lil' buddy\nAll of us zombies over here, lil' buddy\nAll of us robbin' 'cause they love your money\nGot our own money, but we love your money\nCrack a nigga's head wide open like a pumpkin\nJaguar F-Type orange like a pumpkin\nYoung nigga, I got old hundreds\nSmokin' K2 with my bunkie (woo!)\n\nLil' bitch, you can't fuck with me if you wanted to (woo!)\nThese expensive, these is red bottoms, these is bloody shoes (woo, woo!)\nHit the store, I can get 'em both, I don't wanna choose\nAnd I'm quick, cut a nigga off, so don't get

come and get you\nAnd I'm tired of y'all baby mamas y'all nothing but drama\nAlways worrying about the new bitch why you so foolish watching my moves you like how I do shit\nI make you feel insecure but that's not my problem\nJust worry about your kid and I'ma keep popping my collar\nAnd for those who want to know I'm not your average hoe\nI be on my bullshit, but yea I got standards though\nYeah I fucked a couple niggas pulled a couple tricks\nBust a couple splits sucked a couple dicks\nBut there is a story to everything and that's just real shit\nMy family had to eat and I had to pay the rent\nIf it's green I'ma get it please stay the fuck out my business\nBitch try me I promise you get it\nBitch try me there will be no winning\nGotta watch all these faces there's too many counterfeits\nSometimes when you hear them say I got you you can't even count on it\nThat's why I fuck with my bitches only my bitches\nMy day one bitches so please do not fuck with my bitches\nThat's a brick in your face and you gon need stitches\nI see that you moving suspicious\n200 dollars, they do you with quickness\nThat's word to my niece I'm not kidding\nI fuck with them BONs and they get

labels, throwin' deals from left to right\nBut I ain't givin' in until they get them numbers right\nAll these people think that this shit happen overnight\nAll that flexin' they be doin', shit is all a hype\nNo tolerance for a hatin' bitch talkin' shit\nOnly time I hold my tongue is when I'm suckin' dick\nSo when I see you in the streets, yeah, it's fuckin' lit\nAnd don't be talkin' all that sorry shit, don't flip the script\nI see the lights, I hear the hype, I hit the mic\nI kill the show, I get my dough, I catch a flight\nI see a hater, I'm runnin' down, it's on sight\nI throw my hands, I hit em' left, I hit em' right\n\nThey sleepin' on me just because I used to strip\nBut it's all good 'cause now they wanna get up in my VIP\nBlowin' up my phone, sayin' everythin' I touch is lit\nActin' corn and wanna fuck me like they wasn't talkin' shit, woah\nI let 'em live, let the shady motherfuckers live\nGet them the price then it's time to show them what it is\nDon't got the bat? Well then what you really tryna pitch?\nDon't waste my time, I ain't never been no average bitch\n\nNot to mention, I did my tour and that shit was winnin'\nIndependent, the headline, award of feelin'\nI thank the Lord for all the blessings that he is given\nI love the fans, they fill me up with their ammunition\nI don't really talk shit but now I gotta off this\nI don't know why bitches think we work in the same office\nCorny bitches tryna keep up? Look exhausted\nWave the white flag, girl, you might as well just forfeit\n\nMy ex told me I was never gon' be shit\nLookie, lookie now, lookie now, nigga I'm that bitch\nWhat you thought? Yeah, you really lost, now you kinda sick\nBut I ain't never need a nigga, I was always on my shit, yeah\nI used to stare at magazines on the train\nLookin' at these models like, \"I gotta be this one

skrr yeah they down to ride\nYeah my bitches go to work I'm talking 9 to 5\nThe streets want to fuck around you won't stay alive\nYour man can cross you and I make sure that you pay the price\nSo don't be lacking when you coming home from work at night\nYou run your mouth I poppin out now it's on sight\nYou gon' be just like my pussy hella tight\nA hoe can hate but don't be fucking with my commas\nAnd if she is I'll shape her up and she gon' get the line up\nCan't be starting all these problems if you cannot solve them\nCardi backing down I swear to God that's not an option\n\nRan down on that bitch twice\nRan down on that bitch twice\nYou know me I be with whatever\nIf a bitch beef with me we gon beef foreva\n\nSome bitches claim they with the shits but they ain't with a thing\nI spin the block come around like a boomerang\nSilence silence I don't hear a thing\nWorry about me but your pussy smell like turtle tank\nI pull up on that check nothing less that's all I do\n10 bands 50 bands ain't nothing new\nI see some people who still worried about my revenue\nI'm eating good you wish you could don't worry about my food\nAnd niggas hating on a female ain't no way to live\nYou bitch made make me wonder if you got a dick\nHow you feeling like a man envying a chick\nWake up and go get some money go and find your niche\nSilly muthafucka who raised you\nA nigga with a pussy how disgraceful\nI have my hittas come and duck tape you\nAnd your bitch could get it too double date boo\nSo let's get it so let's get it so let's get it let's not waste a minute\nYou clearly started so let's finish\nI don't do forgiveness, they take your kindness for a gimmick\nI'm just here for business\nI'm running down and I'm with it\n\nRan down on that bitch twice\nRan down on that bitch

do, I do\nI do what I like, I do, I do\n\nI think us bad bitches is a gift from God (gift from God)\nI think you broke hoes need to get a job (get a job)\nNow I'm a boss, I write my own name on the checks (Cardi)\nPussy so good, I say my own name during sex\nI might smack a bitch 'cause I felt like it\nGucci shoes and a belt like it\nSaid that Cardi is his favorite fragrance\nI'm a rich bitch and I smell like it\nI'm in a boss bitch mood, ay, these heels are Givenchy, ho\nThese are some boss bitch shoes\nIf you ain't no boss bitch, move, ay\nFor the record, I set record record sales\nI like niggas that been in and outta jail\nThey said by now that I'll be finished, hard to tell (I can tell)\nMy little 15 minutes lasting long as hell, huh?\n\nI left a nigga on read 'cause I felt like it\nDress me down in that Red, Saint Laurent jacket\nDapper, dapper, I look fine and my checks divine\nNo wonder, wonder why I do whatever I like\nI do what I like, I do, I do\nI do what I like, I do, I do\nI do what I like, I do, I do\nI do what I like, I do, I do\n\nLook, broke hoes do what they can (can)\nGood girls do what they told (told)\nBad bitches do what they want (they want)\nThat's why a bitch is so cold\nI'm a gangsta in a dress, I'm a bully in the bed\nOnly time that I'm a lady's when I lay these hoes to rest\nThe coupe is roofless, but I get top in it\nI'm provocative, it's my prerogative\n80K just to know what time is it\nCardi rockin' it, go buy stock in it\nSpent what I want, ain't no limit\nI say what I want, I ain't never been timid\nOnly real shit comes out my mouth and only real niggas go in it\nLeave his texts on read, leave his balls on blue\nPut it on airplane mode so none of those calls come through\nHere's a word to my ladies, don't you give these niggas none (give 'em none)\nIf they can make you richer, they can make you cum\n\nI left a nigga on read 'cause I felt like it\nDress me down in that Red, Saint Laurent jacket\nDapper, dapper, I look fine, and my checks divine\nNo wonder wonder why I do whatever I like\nI do what I like, I do, I do\nI do what I like, I do, I do\nI do what I like, I do, I do\nI do what I like, I do, I do"}}, {"title": "I

Your nigga wanna wife me\nYou think 'cause I'm a stripper hoe, that nigga won't think twice B?\nPut this pussy on his face, rde that shit nicely\nSet his ass up, then you really ain't gon' like me\nSo what you tryna do? You and you and you\nI feel some type a way, a bitch finna get loose\nTell me what's the deal?

Your chain and your watch is off\nYou was never with this shit, nigga, knock it off\nYouse a pussy, and your whole block is soft\nYou caught feelings, could she ain't even drop you off\nYou thought that bag was gettin' you pussy, not at all\nYou was gettin' lied, you ain't know she made that call\nTo the dog's dinner, and they starvin'\nI gotta feed all 'em\nI'maget that nigga, you gon' get that bitch\nWhat they thought switched 'cause we both got rich?\nNah, we on the same time\nYou got yours, I got mine\nYou got a problem, get in line\nIt's Cardi B, and 2 times\n\nWho wanna pop off?\nWho

I really don't do this often\nBut the way I'm feelin' now, like whatever, I'm on it\nHave you laid out on the stretcher with your socks off\nHad the pastor prayin', like, \"Sorry for your,

you better pull up on me\nI hope you feel the same when you see my face\n\nNo, I don't think they know\nThey don't know how this go\nThey think I'm broke\nWhat a fuckin' joke\nWhen I walk in the door, I gets my dough\nThen a bitch get low\nI used to kill them poles, now I kill them shows\nThey don't like my growth, well fuck ya hoes\nYeah, 'cause all my bitches that be gettin' with me\nIf I put a fifty, they gon' put a fifty\nEvery night, ask Sue's rendezvous\nIt was Kita, Sweetness, and Ashanti with me\nI had to go get it on some real shit\nIf you a real bitch ,you gon' feel this\nEvery single nigga that came my way\nI finesse and juug on some ill shit\nSo much people think they know my pussy\nBut no one can say they fucked\nPlease show me hoe facts\nName-drop, round 'em up\nThat bum bitch like to run her mouth\nI swear to God I'ma lay her out\nWhen I catch you on the side of town\nMy Guiseppe heels gonna stomp you out\nI'm tired of playin', I'm tired of playin'\nI'ma give you hell, you gon' think I'm Satan\nI see you mad 'cause I'm 'bout to have this whole shit on lock\nIncarceration\nSomeone gave you wrong information\nYou try to play me, that's confirmation\nBut it's all good 'cause when you see my face\nShit don't come out like it's constipation\n\nYou stuck, bitch, yeah\nI know it sucks, bitch, yeah\nPull up, bitch, yeah\nLike wassup, bitch, yeah\n\nPull up on me\nI heard you talkin' cray, I know you hella fake, you better pull up on me\nI hope you feel the same when you see my face, you better pull up on me\nAin't no backin' down, prepared to shake, you better pull up on me\nNow you wanna be my friend, no you ain't safe, you better pull up, homie\n\nLet's go, I mean come on now, who you tryna flex for?\nWhy you actin' like I won't leave you down in the ground?\nBut you knew what it was from the get-go\nThat Cardi on some new shit\nGet that money then I go flip\nSome people think I'm just a dumb bitch\nIf that was true I wouldn't have shit, yeah\nBronx bitch 'til the day I die\nI did my dirt and I ain't gotta lie\nYou can talk crazy on IG\nBut when I run up, let them hands fly\nI don't fuck around with no fuckin' clowns\nAny niggas with me, they fuckin' hounds\nAny bitches with me, they fuckin' down\nSo if you really 'bout it, then pull up now\n\nYou stuck, bitch, yeah\nI know it sucks, bitch, yeah\nPull up, bitch, yeah\nLike wassup,

for dubs\nI guess I really gotta show them what the fuck is up\nI'm on some other shit, that Cardi B gutta shit\nEvery time I catch a hating bitch, she on her stutter shit\nCan't finish her words but on Instagram thuggin' shit\nYou set yourself up, don't make it seem like I be buggin', bitch\nAnd niggas hatin' on me, really be upset\nI don't know, make me wonder what you got between your legs\nYou a real nigga mad at a bitch for getting bread?\nYou's a bitch from birth, you just grew a third leg, woo!\nBite down, bite down, it was crunch time\nYeah I skip all of them bitches in the lunch line\nI put in work, now I'm here at the front line\nReady for the bullshit, I swear it's on my bloodline\nTouch mine, getting slumped, slimed one time\nPump blind, bitches quick, then I dump mine\nPull up with the Gucci clutch, spitting clutch rhymes\nFlyer than a big big B with a Blood tie\nDon't do much, he get hard when I bust wines\nNo straws for this juice box, got one time\nLast nigga I was with went insane\n'Cause my head game over hills like I'm lookin' for the sunshine\nI'm a Bronx bitch birthed from the hip-hop\nFrom the block to the tick tock in the Patek watch\nQuick drop with the cash, couldn't fit the Ziploc\nGrips locked, get your shit popped in my flip flops\nWealthy now, but every dollar, I still want it all\nNow he wanna nail me, I could give your man a cure\nYou gotta mail me, but I don't check my spam at all\nNever feel what you're sayin' like I'm usin' Anbesol\nTravel all around the states getting nice checks\nI was tourin' off a tape, I had a hype set\nIs that the reason all these niggas wanna pipe next?\nI'm a creep, bitch, see his dick through his Nike Tech\nGot 'em all scared, I ain't even strike yet\nWire up jaws when I swing if the mic stretch\nI worked hard, took the right steps, had a shot\nSo I took the shit, now this game gon' need a life vest\n\nUh\nI said, woo!\nHuh", "image":

finish her words but on Instagram thuggin' shit\nYou set yourself up, don't make it seem like I be buggin', bitch\nAnd niggas hatin' on me, really be upset\nI don't know, make me wonder what you got between your legs\nYou a real nigga mad at a bitch for getting bread?\nYou's a bitch from birth, you just grew a third leg, woo!\nBite down, bite down, it was crunch time\nYeah I skip all of them bitches in the lunch line\nI put in work, now I'm here at the front line\nReady for the bullshit, I swear it's on my bloodline\nTouch mine, getting slumped, slimed one time\nPump blind, bitches quick, then I dump mine\nPull up with the Gucci clutch, spitting clutch rhymes\nFlyer than a big big B with a Blood tie\nDon't do much, he get hard when I bust wines\nNo straws for this juice box, got one time\nLast nigga I was with went insane\n'Cause my head game over hills like I'm lookin' for the sunshine\nI'm a Bronx bitch birthed from the hip-hop\nFrom the block to the tick tock in the Patek watch\nQuick drop with the cash, couldn't fit the Ziploc\nGrips locked, get your shit popped in my flip flops\nWealthy now, but every dollar, I still want it all\nNow he wanna nail me, I could give your man a cure\nYou gotta mail me, but I don't check my spam at all\nNever feel what you're sayin' like I'm usin' Anbesol\nTravel all around the states getting nice checks\nI was tourin' off a tape, I had a hype set\nIs that the reason all these niggas wanna pipe next?\nI'm a creep, bitch, see his dick through his Nike Tech\nGot 'em all scared, I ain't even strike yet\nWire up jaws when I swing if the mic stretch\nI worked hard, took the right steps, had a shot\nSo I took the shit, now this game gon' need a life vest\n\nUh\nI said, woo!\nHuh"}}, {"title": "Ring", "album": "Invasion of

little\nAnd bitch know your worth, don't show it all, let em see a little\nAnd if he ain't bout the money, hit the brakes, but do speed a little\nI remember having no money, sleeping at my ex house\nMy mom couldn't take me at the time, so she had to kick me out\nBut I'm not mad at her one bit, cause I don't think I would've took this route\nI had to go get it on my own\nIm just glad I

looks and no fights\nSee me doing me got em wondering how a bitch came a took flight\nThey talk about me all night\nGod damn they must be tight\nThey looking for revenge\n\nYeah, it's not my fault tho\nI swear I just do me and bitches be sick, bitches got sore throats\nLast year I was on the pole\nNow you can catch ya girl on the road\nDamn near 15k a show\nI think some bitches need to know, yeah\nCause I don't brag much\nBut shit really be a blow\nWhen I got bitches that's coming for me like we on the same level, that's a no\nThese bitches is nowhere near my level\nCan't even fit em in my schedule\nYeah your girl is overbooked\nYou really think my attention's gonna catch you\nMixtape been out for 3 weeks\nAnd already charting on Billboards\nFor really think that shit was free\nAll I gotta say is \"thank you Lord\"\nThis is for the ones that was doubting me\nAnd said I was never gon be shit\nAll of a sudden they proud of me\nAnd wanna be hopping on my dick\nThey six, six, six\nYeah, sick, sick, sick, cause they know wassup\nI'm usually always humble but right now I really don't give a fuck\nSome niggas be hating hard\nWhy is it because you didn't buck?\nCause you didn't get the time a day?\nAnd I left ya lame ass in the dust\nOh man, oh man\nIf you hittas pulling straight fam on\nThey saying I'm the next superstar\nCo-signed by Lee Daniels\nIm just tryna play this game clever\nI'm just tryna do that shit right\nSo I hit em wit that \"Foreva\"\nRan down on that bitch twice\n\nThey out here looking for revenge\nAll day, all night\nSee me not once but twice\nAll looks and no fights\nSee me doing me got em wondering how a bitch came a took flight\nThey talk about me all night\nGod damn they must be tight\nThey looking for revenge\n\nKnow I don't really brag much, but bitches better stop fucking playing with me like I can't stunt on a bitch\nLike, like y'all think, y'all think I'm playing with my pussy all day long or something\nYou know what, bring that back\nMm\n\nI know some bitches in the Bronx that wanna be me a little\nBut stop on learning how to suck and fuck and live free a little\nAnd bitch know your worth, don't show it all, let em see a little\nAnd if he ain't bout the money, hit the brakes, but do speed a little\nI remember having no money, sleeping at my ex house\nMy mom couldn't take me at the time, so she had to kick me out\nBut I'm not mad at her one bit, cause I don't think I would've took this route\nI had to go get it on my own\nIm just glad I figured it out\nLike I been through a lot\nAnd it wasn't easy to escape\nThat's why it really bothers me when motherfuckers got something to say\nAnd just to set the record straight\n to stop a J\nIf they ain't SwiftOnDemand, then they ain't help me in no way\nI swear they be wanting so much credit\nBut don't wanna give none when it's due\nSlept on ya girl for so long\nNow wanna come hopping out the blue\nNah bruh shit don't work like that\nWell at least it don't in my book\nCause if you fuck with me hard, and I fuck with you, then there's no other way to look\nImma hit em again and again\nGet so much music, it go to ya friend\nHitting a tour and the shade gon end\nHmm that's why they looking for revenge"}}, {"title": "Stripper Hoe", "album": null, "year": "2016-02-15", "lyrics": "I'm your...\n\nYo, I'm Cardi B with the wicked flow\nAsk them, I

little fake ass friends\nCome around actin' like they my bros\nI seen y'all little group texts\nWhere you all like to brag about your hoes\nAnd you can tell your little bitch\nI screenshotted all her naked pics\nOh, you wanna send nudes to my man?\nWake up and see your boobs on the 'Gram?\nLil' bitch, I cannot stand you, right hand to Jesus\nI might just cut all the tongues out your sneakers\nSmash your TV from Best Buy\nYou gon' turn me into into Left Eye\nI don't wanna hear 'bout invasion of privacy\nI had a feeling, it turns out you lie to me\nI'm holdin' back everything that's inside of me\nHow you all fuckin' with bitches that follow me?\n\nMy heart is beating like it's bleeding out\nYou sleepin', you sleepin', you sleepin'\nYou sleeping like a baby\nEveryone was right about you now, and\nYou creepin', you creepin', you creepin'\n\nI went through your phone last night\nI went through your phone last night\nSaw some things I didn't like\nI went through your phone last night\nIt's killin' me, killin' me, killin' me, oh\n\nAll I can see is you and her in different scenarios\nBeyonc\u00e9 on my stereo, \"Resentment\" on repeat\nI'ma make a bowl of cereal

want this he gon' have to buy all of that\nI'm with the shits if a nigga want this he gon' have to buy all of that\nHe just want to splurge and its ok I'm so cool with that\n5 thousand on a purse yeah baby boy I'm so cool with that\nFuck him so good he gonna want to go spend all that\nPussy got him on the jugg he gonna re-up and come right back\n\nNo I'm not cool, 'cause bitch I'm bool\nAnd I'm been jacking that ever since school\nSo don't be a fool\nRun up on me got mechanics with tools\nAnd they ain't scared to lose\nThey had me on snooze\nNow when I host it's is a zoo\nWhen the host is a zoo\nGot me a check I got a check\nFeeling so blessed\nDoing a lot more than what they expect\nI'm in my prime everything in effect\nAnd I'm so cool with that\nThis hustle not new to that\nSell out these spots got 'em thinking like who did that\nThis new bitch from the Bronx\nThe one that you slept on for so long so cool all that, cool all that\n\nHundred band, hundred band\nI'm 'bout my bread I got to get this shmoney man\nThey fuck with my shmoney I'm sending them shots I watch them do the running man\nI'm with the shits if a nigga want this he gon' have to buy all of that\nI'm with the shits if a nigga want this he gon' have to buy all of that\nHe just want to splurge and its ok I'm so cool with that\n5 thousand on a purse yeah baby boy I'm so cool with that\nFuck him so good he gonna want to go spend all that\nPussy got him on the juug he gon' re-up and come right back\n\nHe want to dab in this pussy but I don't think he get the picture\nHe ask me what I want I tell him, make me look like Sub-Zero sister\nI'm talking that ice, just ignore the price or I might just dismiss ya\nDon't do broke niggas, ain't no joke nigga 'cause the pussy delicious\nBitches mad at me cause I'm on my shit\nI know they doubted me cause I used to strip\nBlew on IG on some regular shit, then she to TV on some degular shit\nWhen I pull up on that bitch for talking that shit amnesia kick in and I swear they forget\nThen I think to myself they ain't fuck with my money then I keep it pushing watch out lil' bitch\n\nHundred band, hundred band\nI'm 'bout my bread I got to get this shmoney man\nThey fuck with my shmoney I'm sending them shots I watch them do the running man\nI'm with the shits if a nigga want this he gon' have to buy all of that\nI'm with the shits if a nigga want this he gon' have to buy all of that\nHe just want to splurge and its ok I'm so cool with that\n5 thousand on a purse yeah baby boy I'm so cool with that\nFuck him so good he gonna want to go spend all that\nPussy got him on the jugg he gon' re-up and come right back"}}], "artist": "Cardi B"}
