Great! Do I give a flying duck?\nIf I'm applyin' love to my rhymin' plus alignin' us?\nAlabama's climbin' up\u2014wait, no I don't give a\nFlying duck, nothin' but a buckshot, ch, pow!\nMotherfuck your life, pussy blood clot\nAin't never been no rapper this cold since 2Pac was froze\nAnd thawed out for a spot date at a Coachella show, Yelawolf\n\nWeed a different color like a hoodrat bra and panties\nAnd my flow be overhead like pots and pans in pantries\nAntsy 'cause I'm high like Michael Jackson, penny loafers\nMoonwalkin' on the sun, barefoot, with shades on\nBitch pussy smell like a penguin\nWouldn't hit that shit with my worst enemy's penis\nBitch, when I say this, I mean this: Ho, I'm the meanest\nDick so big, it's like from Earth to Venus\nThat molly got me nauseous, aw, shit, no off switch\nLawless, obnoxious, on that \"suck my cock\" shit\nThat is my synopsis, ostrich's posh shit\nHoes on some goth shit, stop it! You not this!\nNovice, regardless, heartless and awkward\nCryin' tears of vodka, prima donna at the concert\nAdonis smokin' chronic, 'bout to vomit gin and tonic\nJust bein' honest, tell me, isn't that ironic?\n\nSwiftly, I shift the Bimmer 860\nA heavy smoker, so you know I brought the Blake with me\nThe moon\u2019s reflection off the lake hit me\nYou should have stayed with me, now many Asian bitches lay with me\nThe face is silky like a tablecloth\nMy shorty gallop in the mornin' on the beach like a Chilean horse\nRed roses dropped from boxes very often\nConfetti torchin', drinkin' Henny like I'm Kenny Lofton\nOutstandin', I fixed the game between Georgia Southern and Gramblin'\nYou see us scramblin', sellin'  Susan Sarandon\nThe cloud of smoke like the phantom\nDamn, this shit tastes like fantastic, uh\nYou see me comin' through in each state\nJust so the lord could put the fork inside the cheesecake\nCuffed to my wrist, I've got the briefcase\nThe gavel slam, I'm a free man, try not to eat ham\n\nBig K.R.I.T., shawty\nSpit like my last breath: casket rap, six deep\nEyes closed, the black is back, out come the 'lac with flats\nAfter that, bottles I can't pronounce, like, \u201cHow you ask for that?\u201d\nWhy you ask for crack and all you had was scratch?\nAll I had was rap, when all they had was wack\nAll I wanted was love and all they had was dap\nFuck them haters and fuck them hoes, a championship win is\nThe aftermath, ask LeBron, open palm, slap a bitch\nWalk the plank or break a bank, I've been in the business of sinkin' ships\nChokin' niggas out with the anchors that they anchor with\nResuscitations cost the label, I'm taxin' if you want a hit\nClear, fuck your career, bitch, I was born here\nBeen a killer, '86er nigga, that's my born year\nGet the fuck from 'round here, that's just my country ways\nSuckin' on your momma's titty, bitchin' while I was choppin' blade\nGrippin' grain, fuckin' hoes, candy paint like Everglades\nMiss me with that rapper chatter, take that shit up with my bass\nI put that on my soul, how could you ever doubt me?\nMost rappers hopin' the world end so they won't have to drop another album\nB. B. King saw the king in me, so why can't you?\nIn order to come up close, you'll have to dig up Cash and Elvis, too\n(That were no sample, nigga!)\nMuddy water flow, Dixie rebel past\nFuck your Louis flag,poppin' benji tags on your wifey's ass\nThat's out of line, but in livin' color?\nI'm more like Miya Bailey on you rap motherfuckers: a true artist", "image": "https://images.genius.com/75621d1119a70043aadbe3fbf4387d88.640x640x1.jpg", "artist": "A$AP Rocky", "raw": {"annotation_count": 107, "api_path": "/songs/103554", "description": {"dom": {"tag": "root", "children": [{"tag": "p", "children": ["Featuring a slew of upcoming popular MCs over a beat crafted by ", {"tag": "a", "attributes": {"href": "https://genius.com/artists/Hit-boy"}, "data": {"api_path": "/artists/21188"}, "children": ["Hit-Boy"]}, "\u2014the producer behind ", {"tag": "a", "attributes": {"href": "https://genius.com/Kanye-west-niggas-in-paris-lyrics"}, "data": {"api_path": "/songs/51899"}, "children": ["\u201cNiggas in Paris\u201d"]}, "\u2014\"1 Train\" was the most anticipated track for many prior to the release of ", {"tag": "em", "children": ["Long.Live.A$AP"]}, ".

obituaries\nDon't be scared, nigga, is you ready?\nI've been thinkin' 'bout all the O's in my bank account (What?)\nX the hoes in my bed is 'round the same amount (What?)\nEver since this new star fame came about\nOr ever since me and Drizzy started hangin' out, huh\nYoung boy, let his gun bang, let his nuts hang\nTransition to a Lamborghini from a Mustang\nDrugs slang in the drug game with the hustling\n(I know one thing) Anything is better than that 1 Train\nBag made of Goyard, cheffin' like I'm Boyar-\nDee, probably sellin' D in your local courtyard\nBraids like I'm O-Dog, my la familia go hard\nDown to my inlaws, they outlaws with no laws\n\nWe outlawed then I bogart, any pros that got 'proached at\nWith a toe-tag, get broke off in the projects with a skateboard\nI roll past and I blaze y'all like, \"Doo, doo,\" I hate y'all\nWhen the beef cooked, I ate y'all like, \"Mmm, mmm!\"\nLet's play ball in a ballpark with all sharks and a blindfold\nI rhyme cold, my K hot, your 9 cold, that bark like K9's on\nThat banana clip, straight from the rip\nI'll make that shirt say RIP, I'm on some shit\nIf I'm not the hottest then Hell must have froze over\nYou thought it was safe then forgot what the code was\nI carry traits of a traumatized soldier\nDon't look in my face, I might snap, I might choke ya\nSpine right out of place, give me dap like you 'posed ta\nDarts at your posters, dark nights like this\nI metamorph like I'm 'posed ta, I might slice my wrist\nOr pretend like a vulture and drop off this cliff\n\nBarely even conscious, talkin' to my conscience\nGettin' deeper in these flows like conches\nI'm on my convict, don't drop bars, I drop prisons\nDon't sell rocks, seen the spectrum through the prisms\nSomehow bypassed the bias and the -isms\nThe violence and the killin', so given\nThey seen my pigment and thought that was the ign'ance\nUnfortunately, I am not that type of niglet\nBut pass the pot, let me skillet\nJust got back to the block from a 6 o' clock with Jigga\nAnd I'm thinkin' 'bout signin' to the Roc\nBut my niggas on the block still assigned to the rocks\nAnd I swear it hurt me soul\nI try to prevail, but when I preach, I only hurt their sales\nLike you're only gon' end up either dead or in jail\nBut you my nigga, wish you the best for real\n\nWhen you mention my name amongst other white rappers\nOr for that matter, any fuckin' rapper, fuck it\nPainter, skater, musician, trailer-park, dirt-ditch-diggin'\nBurger-flippin', eat, sleep, shittin' human bein', you would be in\nTrouble to body double or couple me to these others\n'Cause comparatively speakin', my reach is beyond the bubble\nThat they put me in, my vision's beyond the Hubble's\nI huddle with Nubians, new beginnin' again\nYou in school at 10, late, Radioactive's goin' gold\nAnd so? Great! Do I give a flying duck?\nIf I'm applyin' love to my rhymin' plus alignin' us?\nAlabama's climbin' up\u2014wait, no I don't give a\nFlying duck, nothin' but a buckshot, ch, pow!\nMotherfuck your life, pussy blood clot\nAin't never been no rapper this cold since 2Pac was froze\nAnd thawed out for a spot date at a Coachella show, Yelawolf\n\nWeed a different color like a hoodrat bra and panties\nAnd my flow be overhead like pots and pans in pantries\nAntsy 'cause I'm high like Michael Jackson, penny loafers\nMoonwalkin' on the sun, barefoot, with shades on\nBitch pussy smell like a penguin\nWouldn't hit that shit with my worst enemy's penis\nBitch, when I say this, I mean this: Ho, I'm the meanest\nDick so big, it's like from Earth to Venus\nThat molly got me nauseous, aw, shit, no off switch\nLawless, obnoxious, on that \"suck my cock\" shit\nThat is my synopsis, ostrich's posh shit\nHoes on some goth shit, stop it! You not this!\nNovice, regardless, heartless and awkward\nCryin' tears of vodka, prima donna at the concert\nAdonis smokin' chronic, 'bout to vomit gin and tonic\nJust bein' honest, tell me, isn't that ironic?\n\nSwiftly, I shift the Bimmer 860\nA heavy smoker, so you know I brought the Blake with me\nThe moon\u2019s reflection off the lake hit me\nYou should have stayed with me, now many Asian bitches lay with me\nThe face is silky like a tablecloth\nMy shorty gallop in the mornin' on the beach like a Chilean horse\nRed roses dropped from boxes very often\nConfetti torchin', drinkin' Henny like I'm Kenny Lofton\nOutstandin', I fixed the game between Georgia Southern and Gramblin'\nYou see us scramblin', sellin'  Susan Sarandon\nThe cloud of smoke like the phantom\nDamn, this shit tastes like fantastic, uh\nYou see me comin' through in each state\nJust so the lord could put the fork inside the cheesecake\nCuffed to my wrist, I've got the briefcase\nThe gavel slam, I'm a free man, try not to eat ham\n\nBig K.R.I.T., shawty\nSpit like my last breath: casket rap, six deep\nEyes closed, the black is back, out come the 'lac with flats\nAfter that, bottles I can't pronounce, like, \u201cHow you ask for that?\u201d\nWhy you ask for crack and all you had was scratch?\nAll I had was rap, when all they had was wack\nAll I wanted was love and all they had was dap\nFuck them haters and fuck them hoes, a championship win is\nThe aftermath, ask LeBron, open palm, slap a bitch\nWalk the plank or break a bank, I've been in the business of sinkin' ships\nChokin' niggas out with the anchors that they anchor with\nResuscitations cost the label, I'm taxin' if you want a hit\nClear, fuck your career, bitch, I was born here\nBeen a killer, '86er nigga, that's my born year\nGet the fuck from 'round here, that's just my country ways\nSuckin' on your momma's titty, bitchin' while I was choppin' blade\nGrippin' grain, fuckin' hoes, candy paint like Everglades\nMiss me with that rapper chatter, take that shit up with my bass\nI put that on my soul, how could you ever doubt me?\nMost rappers hopin' the world end so they won't have to drop another album\nB. B. King saw the king in me, so why can't you?\nIn order to come up close, you'll have to dig up Cash and Elvis, too\n(That were no sample, nigga!)\nMuddy water flow, Dixie rebel past\nFuck your Louis flag,poppin' benji tags on your wifey's ass\nThat's out of line, but in livin' color?\nI'm more like Miya Bailey on you rap motherfuckers: a true artist"}}, {"title": "\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606

pinky ring, bling, bling\nAnd all my niggas here, they about to kill this shit\nWhat you say Nast?\n\nHold up dog, Nast in this bitch again\nSipping Hen, staring at that white girl from Michigan\nShe was with a friend, fat ass fly ho\nI went in for the kill, ASAP, pronto\nSo wait boo, 'fore we hit your condo\nGot another friend with me named Whitney from Chicago\nWhitney love ta model? I'm thinkin' m\u00e9nage\nThe truck parked out from, the Chevy get Ta-hoes\nHaters all in my face, can't see, blindfold\n? on my feet, blew right by folks\nStuntin' on sucker niggas is what I was designed for\nDead fresh, fresh to death, I should have designed clothes\nBut I'm blessing these tracks, sick flow, swine flu\nY'all ain't fucking with Nast, I been nice, y'all knew\nHaha, nigga that shit times two\nI'm who your bitches wanna kick it with, kung-fu\nBut what, dog? What is you saying?\nNast in this bitch, ho, why is you playing?\nLike I won't slay this stage on some gang shit?\nTurn into a mayhem, beat hard, flow hurtin\nCali swag bitch, snapback, no jerkin'\nFuck work, fuck money in hands, hoes know this\nFast forward, past focus, I'm that on it\nOne of the best to do, I think not, you bet on it\nGiant ass you be lumberjack Paul Bunyon\nHoes love

motherfucker\nAlready know I never been a sucker\nSee I lust ya, I want ya\nBaby come home, babygirl, what's your name, Wanda?\nDo you wanna get up on me?\nDo you wanna bend over?\nDo you feel horny?\nDo you wanna feel the stroke?\nIt's kind of like Facebook when you feel a poke\nASAP, no joke\nRaider Klan, all back and we aiming at your throat\n\nI wanna rock but the bitches want me, though\nD&G briefs fit a nigga like a Speedo\nSkinny nudie jeans, though\nBoots be 40 below\nHe flow, 100 degrees, the jewels zero\nRockstar rap, he reps Guitar Hero\nLeopard Louboutins like Speedo on Steve-O\nCharge me on the game, couldn't pause me on Tivo\nBeyonce, the Kanye, I got a big ego\nOn to that next shit, you looking at the bestest\nMarried to the game, treat you niggas like my stepkids\nPull up in a Porsche, niggas get nausea\nDidn't write the rules but my status like the author\nJust crashed the range, so I pulled the Bent out\nProbably getting brains, chilling in the penthouse\nSwagging on you maggot and I'm about to lay the pimp down\nChristian Louboutin red bottoms come in mens now\nOn to the next ones, skinny jeans fit in\nPull up to the shows and these hoes know to get in\nSaid they like my fitted clothes down to my split ends\nLittle do she know, I got a big ego\nAutomatic weapon need an order of protection\nKillin Feelin all these records so my charges is molesting\nAssault with deadly weapons, got these rappers feeling threatened\nA hip-hop veteran, I'm a hip-hop felon\n\nIt's a war going on outside and we started it\nBelieve that or die, nigga, on some martyr shit\nAll my niggas on the scene like some Sparta shit\nAnd we came to double up on that Harlem shit\nWe all eating, this is how it's supposed to go\nStop speaking, this is how you supposed to flow\nThe ins and out, never a winner's route\nI never lose again, it's like every day I lose a friend\nTo some dumb shit, whore and dumb bitch\nSo a hating nigga, whore cuff wrists\nI know a lot of niggas sitting in a cell now\nFor the shit I've done, I'm probably even hell-bound\nBut it's cool with me, jacking niggas' jewelry\nI don't give a fuck about your foolery\nNigga keep a tool with me just to blast at you bitches\nMarvelous at the top and our rags to the riches\nASAP, nigga\n\nOn my Pokemon shit, you already know...\nI said, I said, I said\nI swear to God I want it

the Gods, tell me what God sipping now\nHenny, and I'm out here and my dad was in bed\nSo I down a whole bottle on that bitch with the mink\nI go haaaaaaaard\nI'm sorry, Mama Ferg, for all of these

bitch ride that big thing, you on that little shit\nTrying to make noise, you squeaking like a little pit\nPut her into that dog, my attitude's a little Vick\n\nNext time my niggas fall back\nASAP Raider Clan and we all blacked out\nTell that bitch get it mapped out\nAnd I fucked a bitch, now she flat out\nChest out, on the fucking floor, never hit it raw\nGot a condom and I got a towel by the door\nJust in case the smoke go into the hallways\nCause I be smoking weed and fucking all day\nThis is off the top of the dome, let me introduce my niggas before a nigga go home\nWe got Ty Beats, the illest producer in the streets\nYou know he come through with that motherfucking heat\nGot Twelvy, motherfucking Twelvy, got a bad bitch, Jewish named Shelby\nGot my nigga Nast in the back\nGot a snapback to the back, he don't even know how to act\nGot my nigga named Purrp, Spaceghostpurrp, do your bitch real dirt\nThat's dirty, little flirty, fucked a bitch named Purdy, did her dirty\nGot my

Waldorf\nPast the racism and fake-ism\nType of hate that make you feel worse than a rape victim\nRaw dogs, you other niggas mad soft, mad I rap my ass off\nThey throwin' mad salt 'til I go bath salt\nOn wax, spitting heat to melt the wax off\nI'm Mr. Miyagi in Issey Miyake\nAsshole flow, fuck name brands, past logos\nNow I'm onto grand raps, hands so low, uh\nIt's like my fashion style is the life saver\nGuess she wasn't satisfied with titties that Christ gave her\nBragging that her new ass shots is a life changer\nHead so good on that girl that I might pay her, or nah\nSuper laid back cat, opposite of fat black, Al Capone\nTell them lil' niggas Flacko home\n\nGotta find my way back home\nI've been away too long\nGotta find my way back home\nI've been away too long\nGotta find my way back home\nI've been away too long\nGotta find my way back home\nI've been away too long\n\nUhh, Father, Lord forgive me as I load up the semi\nRoll through the city, that chose to resent me\nHold it, don't load it, reload it on plenty\nAny foe or a (*beep*) that ever voted against me, dissed me\nPissed me off then tried to hold it against me\nOr wish we off the worst of luck that ever hated\nNever hesitated, the designated, all of the wrong that they did me\nIs stored in my memory all of the thoughts that I thought of\nMeans more for my enemies\nSippin' holy water like it's bore from my kidneys\nLoad the smoke like a chimney, make a toast for the memories\nMake a toast for the henny, it's the best for the remedies\nEnergy, synergy, frienemies, industries\nFinna get advantage on him and his nemesis, bitches been sniffing\nIf I, if I ain't the greatest, bitch I'm one of em\nHow in the fuck could you front on em?\nMy old ho beefing, my ex won't be friends\nBronson told me not to eat ham, rest in peace Yams\n\nGotta find my way back home\nI've been away too long\nGotta find my way back home\nI've been away too long\nGotta find my way back home\nI've been away too long\nGotta find my way back home\nI've been away too long\n\nRest in peace Yams, RIP A$AP Yamborghini\nWe gon' take it uptown one time\nWe gon' take em back home, show em how me do\nThey call me Pretty Flacko ladies and gentlemen\nI'd like to introduce Pretty Flacko Sr\nYasiin Bey\n\nMagnum spectacular, black man megalas\nShine amethyst, fly champion, it's like that again\nWhat's happening? Mathematics master blin'\nFlacko season, all day, erryday\nAsk me how it's going, I tell em on and on and on and on and\nYou led me out to Arizona, steady flowing, staying golden\nSand cover, ready rover, Flacko glowing in that Owens\nThat's how it's going (Gotta find my way back home)\nHuh, awareness to the areas, familiar with the routes\nTravellin' man, moving through places\nSpace and time, in a country called Earth\n\nNah'mean? These tacky ass muh'fuckers be in the pictures\nWearing all types of motherfuckin' red and green stripes\nOver accessorizing out this motherfucker\nWe from Harlem, we gave y'all motherfuckers this wave\nGrab y'all surfboards, cause y'all got your boogie boards right now, fucker\nY'all just gon' keep watching us at the beach shore\nWith your motherfuckin' khakis rolled up\nWith your chancletas in your hand\nAnd we just gon' keep surfing on this motherfucker\nStraight up! It's ya' boy, A$AP Yams, Yamborghini\nYo Rock man, let these motherfuckers know what it is\nOut this motherfucker, A$AP, bitch!"}}, {"title": "Back to the Future", "album": null, "year": "2011-09-19",

to bone, chats on the phone\nHer three friends with her just'a tagging along\nAs for the flow, back to the song\nFlashbacks only bring me back to that thong\nCause we been getting, we\u2019ve been getting high all week\nSmoking, drinking, I\u2019m her drug and she get high off me\nNow I\u2019m back to the store\nBlunt wrapped, full of 'dro\nRoll it back in that Backwood\nPass it and smoke\nWant to get her high so I pass her the most\nShe want that bread and butter so I pass her the toast\nThat A$AP motto is \"party, get high\"\nWe back to the future\nThat Marty McFly\n\nSometimes I think about the past\nSeems like the time is flying fast\nSo how my presence always last\nThe future\u2019s always going back\nLa la la la la la la la la\nBack to the future, that Marty McFly\n\nBack through the door, back from the store\nBack to the wall with my back to the wall\nRollin' up a blunt, passing it off\nAss on the floor, cash back on the floor\nMack with the broads, chat to the whores\n\"There go my niggas\" dap to my dawgs\nI prey on that pussy, chat with the Lord\nSeem how it seems like I had it before\nI think back, way back ran with my memories\nWe was getting high, sippin' on Hennessy\nNow it's like lean\nThinkin' back seat\nWay back riding on something clean, knamean\nTwenty-tens\nWe don't do the teens now it's twenty-eleven\nLet me know something take her back to my session\nBack to the pad, now I\u2019m back on that ass\nBack to the future, back to the past\n\nSometimes I think about the past\nSeems like the time is flying fast\nSo how my presence always

sellin' speed\nFix the face then fix the weave, now workin' on her self-esteem\nHit up Bloc (brrr), yo' this Flock, nigga, where you at?\nPin the drop, uh, my new map location be the block on the

natural, I suppose, but we're all super good friends\nUm, I get the feeling that you're admired, but, um\nI'm above average\n\nI got so much beef, I could barely sleep\nParanoia got me losin' all my Z's, all day\nGood lord, momma prayin' on her knees, all day\nIf you still frontin' when I up it, I'mma squeeze\n\nBad company's bad for your company\nBad company's bad for your company\nMac and the ski mask in case you come for me\nGot the Mac and the ski mask in case you come for me\n\nWhen I say I got beef, they don't want no beef\nWhen they say they got beef, they don't wanna eat\nIf he said he wants smoke, they don't want no steam\nShe put her feet on her teeth, bad bad bad bad bad\nHad a bachelors degree, Ph.D. while sellin' speed\nFix the face then fix the weave, now workin' on her self-esteem\nHit up Bloc (brrr), yo' this Flock, nigga, where you at?\nPin the drop, uh, my new map location be the block on the app\n\nI need money and company, nah nah\nBad bitches, I don't even know the company, hahahaha\n\nYou\u2014you\u2014you can't hang baby, we don't want you 'round here\nI\u2014ice on my neck and it's froze, Santa's reindeer\nY\u2014you got bad bitches, hella hoes, i\u2014i\u2014it's the same here\nYou bad company, lil' bro, you can't hang here\nG\u2014g\u2014g\u2014gettin' money so the bottles keep on comin'\nPh\u2014ph\u2014pho\u2014pho\u2014phone ringin' so you know the trap jumpin'\nTha\u2014tha\u2014that nigga lookin' at me, he owe me some money\nHit 'em with the Tommy, now that nigga crumpin'\nWhy\u2014why these niggas playin' games? They don't want no problems with me\nMy shooters got good aim, you know I brought them shottas with me\nMight have hit a bad stain, they say that someone top was missin'\nThem niggas were opposition\nThey move wrong, so I shot them bitches\n\nDark shades, too much smoke, I could barely see the fumes\nActin' brand new like I don't see you when I do\nWho them folks? Who want smoke? You too close, give me room\nPhoney folks, play it close, do the most, don't they?\n\nBad company, that's bad for your company\nBad company, that's bad for your company\nMad cow disease, now you in a ton of beef\nBlack Mac tucked underneath my new blue dungarees\n\nFlintstone bust down, color Murakami\nFruity pebble bezel, Wilma, Betty, Fred, and Barney\nBad bitch from outta town, I think she model Abercrombie\nWrist game Lucky Charmy, told my jeweler Leprechaun me\nI'mma come clean, I got hella beef\nParanoia got me rollin' up my sleeves, okay\nNiggas hatin' cause I'm uppin' up the fees\nWhole team got V's on they tees, all day\n\nI got so much beef, I could barely sleep\nParanoia got me losin' all my Z's, all day\nGood lord, momma prayin' on her knees, all day\nIf you still

insane, ultimate trill shit\nAnd there is not a soul that can see me\nLike I'm not real trick\nListen up niggas I'm tired of you lames\nI'm hungry and you looking like entire food chains\nAnd uh, it's to the point that I ain't even got to try hard\nSpittin' like a lake in hell, but bitches like my God\nPlus niggas flicking lenses on me like a tripod\n'Cuz they know there's only one eye, like cyclops\nYou know I beat 'em to the count, to the points love\nI swear I never even lost in a coin toss\nSo bow down mothafuckas, if you talking deep shit I\u2019ll out drown mothafuckas\nSomebody find my rocker cause I'm literally off it\nI'm in the murder business I just spit you bitches a coffin\n\nYo, til the day I die, I be puffing lye\nFuck the world, fuck it dry\nTell them government spies I won't cover my eyes\nWon't cower, won't move, cause I don't move like a coward\nKnowledge is power and the flower of life is ours\nGet as high as ours, maybe you can see the towers\nScour your dirty mind and maybe you'll unleash the power\nWe all got the potential in our body and soul\nProbably you know I found mines right through the pencil\nStarted bodying flows, but fuck that\nThis be the preview of primeval hip-hop retrieval\nI hold illegal like them coppers hold weasels to Squeal\nThis one for my people, heading to the top, no re-do\nThinking up evil but see no evil just be Knievel\nYou can't be this good they just made me better\nThey told me cheese at the cams and they made me cheddar\nAnd the green only made me better\nSee, God made three Bigs, 2 Pacs but he only made one era, The Era\n\nSwear you guys slipping like some ice on a bridge\nSince diapers and bibs\nThe light skin has been quite nicer than how Mike was to kids\nCypher rhyming, Rikers Island, spending nights with the pen\nEither that or cyber-Skyping with a dyke and her friend\nShe telling me, she gon' take my cock to her lips\nSuffice to my wish, saliva and recycle my kids, gulp\nI'm the best, it's hard to lose hope\nI'm spitting rappers out like orange juice pulp\nAnd looking in the mirror like aren't you dope\nYou so clean motherfucker you should hardly use soap\nSomething sinister, raps that minister\nYou mortals don't want combat, I'll block and finish ya\nI'm seriously dope, I'm crack, I'm venomous\nAnd you are seriously poked in your crack by ministers\nEww, these days rappers on my TV\nAre braggers about their swagger rocking karats off of Ebay\nBut I ain't tripping, I like groupie women\nWho be sendin' chills up your spine when you see they booty switching\nFast cars with the kufi missing, that's top off\nPop off, I'm with my dawgs like Stewie Griffin\nNiggas hear me, be like ooh he be ripping\nAnd if your girl see me she catch that Driicky spank me, do me feeling\nOver the money I be pooky twitching\nAnd honestly about the beef I gives a fuck what who be Twittin'\n\nStill good with a pen, no Joe Paterno\nI count Ninja Turtles, my cash flow concern them\nGambino you meet him, repping east side of the A hard\nGot the Black AMEX, I gotta pull the race card\nNiggas move that Kreayshawn, naw I don't carry mine\nWhy the game fucked up like my hairline\nAy girl, you ever smoke a bowl out with Kid Cudi?\nYou ever gotten D like you don't study?\nRap game in the fast lane, with a gas tank\nFilled with half of these trash lames\nI have to say I'm such a Joey's last name\nBino boy, why you spit so mean\nWhy the flow so rich girl, them sweet sixteens\nHe on BET and he got White people problems\n\"Like, Whole Foods doesn't have the juice I like so I have to go to, you know\nTrader Joe's and have it shipped to me\"\nVictory, history\nMore G than a kid's movie, Royalty\n\nMy name is Rock in the new drop, my destiny's to be the new Pac\nThat nigga Rocky gotta die, he too hot\nIt\u2019s dead on, must've been tripping and stepping in heron'\nCause I\u2019m cripping the lead on\nI\u2019m getting forensics twisting your head on\nTraffic, mad clips, caskets, pass this, ashes to ashes\nThat shit, backwards, tactics\nBitches only like me for my status\nLiving ghetto fabulous and I\u2019m still acting ratchet\nTwenty-four karats, no dressing with my salads\nNigga with the Patch kids, steady talking cabbage\nGot a chick red like radish, have it\nBitches think they bad til I drop them like habits\nNo one in this cyph' has swag like I do\nChurch with this verse, I'mma hit em with the gospel\nEver since a baby, ask my old lady\nMy first four words was, fuck you, pay me", "image":

edition\nFilm out November 2nd yo\nBut right now check out these new hot weapons right here\nDriicky Graham, A$AP Rocky, Angel Haze, Childish Gambino and Joey Bada$$\nC'mon, splash em son\n\nI came here with one intention: to kill this\nI'm talking head in my hands, mouth on that drill ish\nI be on that wired insane, ultimate trill shit\nAnd there is not a soul that can see me\nLike I'm not real trick\nListen up niggas I'm tired of you lames\nI'm hungry and you looking like entire food chains\nAnd uh, it's to the point that I ain't even got to try hard\nSpittin' like a lake in hell, but bitches like my God\nPlus niggas flicking lenses on me like a tripod\n'Cuz they know there's only one eye, like cyclops\nYou know I beat 'em to the count, to the points love\nI swear I never even lost in a coin toss\nSo bow down mothafuckas, if you talking deep shit I\u2019ll out drown mothafuckas\nSomebody find my rocker cause I'm literally off it\nI'm in the murder business I just spit you bitches a coffin\n\nYo, til the day I die, I be puffing lye\nFuck the world, fuck it dry\nTell them government spies I won't cover my eyes\nWon't cower, won't move, cause I don't move like a coward\nKnowledge is power and the flower of life is ours\nGet as high as ours, maybe you can see the towers\nScour your dirty mind and maybe you'll unleash the power\nWe all got the potential in our body and soul\nProbably you know I found mines right through the pencil\nStarted bodying flows, but fuck that\nThis be the preview of primeval hip-hop retrieval\nI hold illegal like them coppers hold weasels to Squeal\nThis one for my people, heading to the top, no re-do\nThinking up evil but see no evil just be Knievel\nYou can't be this good they just made me better\nThey told me cheese at the cams and they made me cheddar\nAnd the green only made me better\nSee, God made three Bigs, 2 Pacs but he only made one era, The Era\n\nSwear you guys slipping like some ice on a bridge\nSince diapers and bibs\nThe light skin has been quite nicer than how Mike was to kids\nCypher rhyming, Rikers Island, spending nights with the pen\nEither that or cyber-Skyping with a dyke and her friend\nShe telling me, she gon' take my cock to her lips\nSuffice to my wish, saliva and recycle my kids, gulp\nI'm the best, it's hard to lose hope\nI'm spitting rappers out like orange juice pulp\nAnd looking in the mirror like aren't you dope\nYou so clean motherfucker you should hardly use soap\nSomething sinister, raps that minister\nYou mortals don't want combat, I'll block and finish ya\nI'm seriously dope, I'm crack, I'm venomous\nAnd you are seriously poked in your crack by ministers\nEww, these days rappers on my TV\nAre braggers about their swagger rocking karats off of Ebay\nBut I ain't tripping, I like groupie women\nWho be sendin' chills up your spine when you see they booty switching\nFast cars with the kufi missing, that's top off\nPop off, I'm with my dawgs like Stewie Griffin\nNiggas hear me, be like ooh he be ripping\nAnd if your girl see me she catch that Driicky spank me, do me feeling\nOver the money I be pooky twitching\nAnd honestly about the beef I gives a fuck what who be Twittin'\n\nStill good with a pen, no Joe Paterno\nI count Ninja Turtles, my cash flow concern them\nGambino you meet him, repping east side of the A hard\nGot the Black AMEX, I gotta pull the race card\nNiggas move that Kreayshawn, naw I don't carry mine\nWhy the game fucked up like my hairline\nAy girl, you ever smoke a bowl out with Kid Cudi?\nYou ever gotten D like you don't study?\nRap game in the fast lane, with a gas tank\nFilled with half of these trash lames\nI have to say I'm such a Joey's last name\nBino boy, why you spit so mean\nWhy the flow so rich girl, them sweet sixteens\nHe on BET and he got White people problems\n\"Like, Whole Foods doesn't have the juice I like so I have to go to, you know\nTrader Joe's and have it shipped to me\"\nVictory, history\nMore G than a kid's movie, Royalty\n\nMy name is Rock in the new drop, my destiny's to be the new Pac\nThat nigga Rocky gotta die, he too hot\nIt\u2019s dead on, must've been tripping and stepping in heron'\nCause I\u2019m cripping the lead on\nI\u2019m getting forensics twisting your head on\nTraffic, mad clips, caskets, pass this, ashes to ashes\nThat shit, backwards, tactics\nBitches only like me for my status\nLiving ghetto fabulous and I\u2019m still acting ratchet\nTwenty-four karats, no dressing with my salads\nNigga with the Patch kids, steady talking cabbage\nGot a chick red like radish, have it\nBitches think they bad til I drop them like habits\nNo one in this cyph' has swag like I do\nChurch with this verse, I'mma hit em with the gospel\nEver since a baby, ask my old lady\nMy first four words was, fuck you, pay me"}}, {"title": "Better Things", "album": "AT.LONG.LAST.A$AP", "year": "2015-05-26", "lyrics": "Don't give a fuck about your man\nI'm just seeing what it's hitting for (bitch I'm sayin')\nHow you fronting on the kid though?\nYou should fuck with me girl, you know what you need girl\nSee I got used to livin' life up on my own, yeah\nIn search of love and for a wife to call my own, yeah\nIt's all I think about at nights when I'm alone, yeah\nSwear that I can't get no rest in California\n\nSwear that life is, just a whole bunch of vices\nNiggas biting off of my shit, my dick\nStay up in your chick ride stick without a license\nTell her hold on like some vice grips\nMight just call her, let her ride with a baller\nLook up on her face was priceless\nWonder what my type is, well, tonight Mrs. Lightskin\nWith a light mix or a light switch, white chick\nDarkskin complexion and she righteous\nI take a dyke chick if she like dick\nI kissed the dyke chick and I liked it\nFucking each and every Katy Perry for the night bitch, light this\n\nLight it, light it, puff it, puff it, pass it, pass it\n(Moving on to better things, I'm sure)\nBless, sit back and relax one time, clear your mind\n(Can't feed this addiction anymore)\n'Bout to send me back to my old ways, know what I'm saying?\n(Moving on to better things, I'm sure)\nYeah, I'm just, she making mistakes\n(Can't feed this addiction anymore)\n\nI've been puffing, rolling up\nCop a lot and pourin' up\nPlus my niggas know the plug\nA generation's thrown on drugs\n\nI swear that bitch Rita Ora got a big mouth\nNext time I see her might curse the bitch out\nKicked the bitch out once cause she bitched out, spit my kids out\nJizzed up all in her mouth and made the bitch bounce\nRide with a nigga mane, and you know\nI stay fly like the jigga mane, and it figures\nCause here is something you can't understand\nHow I could just kill a man, anyways\nNowadays everybody's stressed, yes\nAnimosity is better off your chest, yes\nGuess everybody want to stay blessed, stay fresh\nTake a nigga threats, but I'm up next, take debts\n\nLight it, light it, puff it, puff it, pass it, pass it\n(Moving on to better things)\nInhale, exhale, relieve your mind of stress, bless\nSmoke some one time for your boy A$AP\n(Can't feed this addiction anymore)\n\nI've been puffing, rolling up\nCop a lot and pourin' up\nPlus my niggas know the plug\nA generation's thrown on drugs", "image":

license\nTell her hold on like some vice grips\nMight just call her, let her ride with a baller\nLook up on her face was priceless\nWonder what my type is, well, tonight Mrs. Lightskin\nWith a light mix or a light switch, white chick\nDarkskin complexion and she righteous\nI take a dyke chick if she like dick\nI kissed the dyke chick and I liked it\nFucking each and every Katy Perry for the night

puffing, rolling up\nCop a lot and pourin' up\nPlus my niggas know the plug\nA generation's thrown on drugs\n\nI swear that bitch Rita Ora got a big mouth\nNext time I see her might curse the bitch out\nKicked the bitch out once cause she bitched out, spit my kids out\nJizzed up all in her mouth and made the bitch bounce\nRide with a nigga mane, and you know\nI stay fly like the jigga mane, and it figures\nCause here is something you can't understand\nHow I could just kill a man, anyways\nNowadays everybody's stressed, yes\nAnimosity is better off your chest, yes\nGuess everybody want to stay blessed, stay fresh\nTake a nigga threats, but I'm up next, take debts\n\nLight it, light it, puff it, puff it, pass it, pass it\n(Moving on to better things)\nInhale, exhale, relieve your mind of stress, bless\nSmoke some one time for your boy A$AP\n(Can't feed this addiction anymore)\n\nI've been puffing, rolling up\nCop a lot and pourin' up\nPlus my niggas know the plug\nA generation's

call it track (hustle)\nRacin' laps, re-up went to waste, it pays to make it stack\nFace the fact, there's always niggas out there, tryin' to knock the (hustle)\nI guess that's why they say we trap, don't let niggas hold you back\nI'm just a kettle from the ghetto with no pot to piss in\nSo who am I to call it black? Black man, black male\nBlack ball, black opsy, black diamonds glistenin'\nAttract the pigs and all the rats, kitten scratch\nI went from roaches on my bump to red brooches on the cuff\nOf my tux, chauffeur pullin' up, no if, and's\u200b or buts about him\nI went to Paris for my trunks, 100 thousand spent on Goyard\nUsed 'em once, couldn't give a shit, damn or fuck about 'em\nHit Canal Street, vintage gold medallion\nSmokin' blunts in front of public housin'\nWildin' 'til they throw me in them cuffs\nMouth full of fronts, look like Master P up in my Cartiers\nDiamonds shinin' in the frames\nChanged the game and made them say (uhh)\nAin't no limits to this shit, life's a flick, you're stickin' to the script\nMy life is like a movie, they should film me through it\nTake a pic, be sure to frame the shit, forever me, was always G\nWay before this famous shit, y'all just pretend to do it\n\nYou say you got them guns, but I've never seen you bang\nYou say you got them drugs, but I've never seen you slang\nYou say you in that game, but I've yet to see you play\nYou say you going hard, but nobody feels the same, yeah\nYou say you got them guns, but I've never seen you bang\nYou say you got them drugs, but I've never seen you slang\nYou say you in that game, but I've yet to see you play\nYou say you going hard, but nobody feels the same, yeah\n\nRap game like the crack game, swear it's all the same (hustle)\nWhippin' soda through the pot, watch it bubble\nFlexin' muscle, hit the block, I bet I teach you niggas how to (hustle)\nSellin' coca on the charts, watch it double\nUh, takin' meetings on my bus, this shit my mobile office\nGettin' head while at my desk, this shit my oval office\nI remember when I got a hundred for recordings\nNow the sum of my performances just put me on the Forbes list\nFuck jiggy, I'm flawless, fuck pretty, I'm gorgeous\nYour favorite rappers' corpses couldn't measure my importance\nMy mind is out in orbits, plus my ego got endorsements\nHeard the people want that raw shit, but y'all be talkin' bullshit\n\nYou say you got them guns, but I've never seen you bang\nYou say you got them drugs, but I've never seen you slang\nYou say you in that game, but I've yet to see you play\nYou say you going hard, but nobody feels the same, yeah\nYou say you got them guns, but I've never seen you bang\nYou say you got them

glass\nAfter that I grab your ass\n\nBitch I hustle every day, you could check my resum\u00e9\nBad Spanish bitch, one kiss'll take your breath away\nI could bag your girl in a broken down Chevrolet\nSwag do the talkin', I ain't even gotta decorate\nI was 21 when I bought my mom a condo\nA guitar and a gift card down at Costco's\nIt's a cold winter when it's blowing past my goggles\nPenthouse, top floor, window with the gargoyle\nPerformance down at Santos, Phantom suicide doors\nPaparazzi slide-shows, showers with the slide doors\nOne night, five shows, two-seater, five hoes\nEyes closed, I can see them hating through the blindfolds\nNiggas better switch it if the business ain't the convo\nI'm all about my chicken nigga you could call me Roscoe's\nIf I wasn't spitting I'd be probably flipping waffles\nI suppose God knows I coulda been a snot-nose\nDAMN\n\nGet money every day (Every night we celebrate)\nGet money every day (Every night we celebrate)\nBitch I hustle every day (Every night we celebrate)\nEvery night we celebrate, Every night we celebrate\n\nFuck is all the talk about? Fuck these niggas talking 'bout?\nShit I know it's us cuz we the only thing to talk about\nI been down to ATL, I seen how they walk it out\nCali Crip Walk it out, show 'em what New York about\nWhat these niggas hating for? Fuck these niggas hating on?\nI'm what they debating for, I'm what they been waiting on\nOut there tryna take it slow but taking slow been taking long\nKnow I'm on the paper trail until I get my paper long\nWhen I'm in the kitchen, catch me with my apron on\nAnd it's back to business, A$AP is where they belong\nAnd we on the grind, that's until I get my paper long\nSee your nigga's face every time you turn your cable on\nMami why your leggings on, face down ass out?\nTylenol and codeine got a nigga 'bout to pass out\nCatch me on a grind and now a nigga 'bout to cash out\nGet money, hella cake, every night we celebrate\n\nGet money every day (Every night we celebrate)\nGet money every day (Every night we celebrate)\nBitch I hustle every day (Every night we celebrate)\nEvery night we celebrate, Every night we celebrate\n\nWhen the boys roll, pull up on the block\nStill we hustle, 'cause we run the spot\nI'll be on my grind, every night dawg\n'Til the coffin close, and my lights off\nI hit 'em up, like my name's Shakur\nCount my dividends, I'm allergic to poor\nI hit 'em up, like my name's Shakur\nStack my paper up, I'm above the law\nI hit 'em Up\n\nGet money every day

full of spinach\nBut tell me what\u2019s for dinner, y\u2019all niggas is beginners\nYou fucking with them losers and my team full of winners\nD\u2019s on that bitch, we never ride spinners\nMy birds down south even if it ain\u2019t winter\nAnd I\u2019m a skinny nigga, but to see if my show\u2019s real\nWalk to the club, ugly mug like hell rell\nMike\u2019s in my palm on my arm like ll\nI\u2019ma put the city on my back like\u2026\nKing kong in the trunk beat you 12-12\nThat\u2019s a 12 gauge handed by the 12th grade\nAnd I\u2019m from Harlem so you know we fly high\nBuckle up ma you rollin' with a fly guy, cause\nBitch I\u2019m me, bitch I\u2019m me, bitch I\u2019m me\nI\u2019m ceo, I\u2019m ceo\nI\u2019m young wild and strapped like Charlie\nBitch I\u2019m me, bitch I\u2019m me, bitch

phases\n\nSo long since I\u2019ve seen her, she can feel a change in me\nChange, she could feel a change in me\nSo long since I\u2019ve seen her, she can feel a change in me\n\nLove comes with a price tag and a barcode\nStill love you when we part though\nBlame me like it's my fault\nStill o-, still okay\nWalk around like your heart cold\nHop around like your parkour\nStill o-, still o-kay\nStill o-, still o-kay\nStill o-, still o-kay\nStill o-, still o-kay (changes)\nStill o-, still o-\nLook, I got a text from this girl I used to see\nSayin' that she chose this other guy with whom she wanna be with\nLook, I apologize, but this message fucked me up\nThen I would skeet-skeet every girl after replying, \"Best of luck to ya\"\nFast forward couple months I'm like, \"Wassup witcha?\"\n'Cause somethin' changed I know ya feel it (feel it)\nBut really it's been a lil' minute\nAin't nothin' changed but the address\nMy neighbors hate how I be livin' (livin')\nMad it's a loud rich nigga in the buildin'\nLike fuck all the other tenants (runnin')\nBought mines, boy, you rentin' (runnin')\nRich niggas in their feelings (runnin')\nRich niggas in their feelings (woo)\nBags packed, knapsack packed like I'm leavin' home\nThey ain't wanna let me go, I guess you need me more\nI was on the road on tour (tour)\nShe just said I changed for the worst\nRain flags, rain backs, fact guess you need it more\nHad to let your heart go, I guess you need it more\n\n(I'm going through changes)\nSweetest smile\n(Always changing phases)\nUpside down\n(I'm going through phases)\nI'll be cruel to you\n(I'm going through changes)\nDon't know if you love me or not\nPart II\n\nThese ain't monkey bars, from no fuckin' kiddy parks\nItchin' with the chicky pox, nigga, shittin' on 'em, need my litty box\nMink on, see the fox (oh, that's how you feel, nigga)\n'03 Bentley Park, by the candy shop, vicky, Vicky Fox\nTime to give them what they want\nRakim Allah mixed with Biggie, Pac\nWeird nigga from the block, uh\nSquare bitches give me box, uh\nShe pussy pop to Iggy Pop\nYou pussy niggas really pop\n\nThanks for the light, waitin' for the light\nChange for a lifetime (what a wonderful life)\nThanks for the night, drinks for the night\nWaitin' for the right time (what a wonderful life)\n(Changed for the better changed for the worse)\nSo far I done been and feelin' change, changes\nSo far I done been and feelin' change, changes\nPart III\n\nMy biggest distractions is that I get distracted\nPeople suing me for shit that didn't happen\nI wonder how the world would be if they didn't have me\n(fuck this shit)\nWake up to my explore page\nSee my exes engaged, or either gettin' married\nOr had a baby with some nigga\nOr either three months, post-natal post, post-nup, that little nigga pappy\nI wonder if they really happy or just gettin' at me\n\nSo long since I\u2019ve seen her, she can feel a change in me\nChange - she could feel a change in me\nSo long since

goin' through changes\nChanges\nI'm goin' through changes\nAll those changin' faces\nI'm goin' through phases\n\nSo long since I\u2019ve seen her, she can feel a change in me\nChange, she could feel a change in me\nSo long since I\u2019ve seen her, she can feel a change in me\n\nLove comes with a price tag and a barcode\nStill love you when we part though\nBlame me like it's my fault\nStill o-, still okay\nWalk around like your heart cold\nHop around like your parkour\nStill o-, still o-kay\nStill o-, still o-kay\nStill o-, still o-kay\nStill o-, still o-kay (changes)\nStill o-, still o-\nLook, I got a text from this girl I used to see\nSayin' that she chose this other guy with whom she wanna be with\nLook, I apologize, but this message fucked me up\nThen I would skeet-skeet every girl after replying, \"Best of luck to ya\"\nFast forward couple months I'm like, \"Wassup witcha?\"\n'Cause somethin' changed I know ya feel it (feel it)\nBut really it's been a lil' minute\nAin't nothin' changed but the address\nMy neighbors hate how I be livin' (livin')\nMad it's a loud rich nigga in the buildin'\nLike fuck all the other tenants (runnin')\nBought mines, boy, you rentin' (runnin')\nRich niggas in their feelings (runnin')\nRich niggas in their feelings (woo)\nBags packed, knapsack packed like I'm leavin' home\nThey ain't wanna let me go, I guess you need me more\nI was on the road on tour (tour)\nShe just said I changed for the worst\nRain flags, rain backs, fact guess you need it more\nHad to let your heart go, I guess you need it more\n\n(I'm going through changes)\nSweetest smile\n(Always changing phases)\nUpside down\n(I'm going through phases)\nI'll be cruel to you\n(I'm going through changes)\nDon't know if you love me or not\nPart II\n\nThese ain't monkey bars, from no fuckin' kiddy parks\nItchin' with the chicky pox, nigga, shittin' on 'em, need my litty box\nMink on, see the fox (oh, that's how you feel, nigga)\n'03 Bentley Park, by the candy shop, vicky, Vicky Fox\nTime to give them what they want\nRakim Allah mixed with Biggie, Pac\nWeird nigga from the block, uh\nSquare bitches give me box, uh\nShe pussy pop to Iggy Pop\nYou pussy niggas really pop\n\nThanks for the light, waitin' for the light\nChange for a lifetime (what a wonderful life)\nThanks for the night, drinks for the night\nWaitin' for the right time (what a wonderful life)\n(Changed for the better changed for the worse)\nSo far I done been and feelin' change, changes\nSo far I done been and feelin' change, changes\nPart III\n\nMy biggest distractions is that I get distracted\nPeople suing me for shit that didn't happen\nI wonder how the world would be if they didn't have me\n(fuck this shit)\nWake up to my explore page\nSee my exes engaged, or either gettin' married\nOr had a baby with some nigga\nOr either three months, post-natal post, post-nup, that little nigga pappy\nI wonder if they really happy or just gettin' at me\n\nSo long since I\u2019ve seen her, she can feel a change in me\nChange - she could feel a change in me\nSo long since I\u2019ve seen her, she can feel a change in me\nSo long since I\u2019ve seen her, she can feel a change in me\nChange - she could feel a change in me\nSo long since I\u2019ve seen her, she can feel a change in me\n\nChanges\nGoin' through changes\nGoin' through changes\nGoin' through changes"}},

records\nDistorted, distorted records\nDistorted records, distorted records\nDistorted records\nWhat more distorted records do you have?\n\nFirst things first, I done heard the worst things\nLike if I'm in your top 10, mine's better be the first name\nOut your mouth, ain't even worth saying\nLittle niggas is my offsprings\nThey deserve a nigga first name, middle name, surname\nFrom another planet, birthplace, Cloud 9, hello earthlings\nMy newest President a asshole\nI guess that's why I'm leaving turd stains\nMy ex used to chill with bad tings\nAll they talk about was bird things\nTry to put them on the bad brains\nBird hoes got the bird brains\nEverything I do groundbreak\nBig body make the floor break\nBig bass make the world shake\nFlacko out here causin' earthquakes\n\nUh, I can feel the bass, uh, I can see the fakes\nWord to T.D. Jakes, uh, word to Pastor Ma$e and Kirk Franklin\nFuck what niggas think, I'm about the bank\nComma, dollar signs, I'm about my Franklins\nI can feel the bass\n\nDistorted, distorted

this for myself, of course my hood and every ghetto\nPaper pushin', paper petal, cause I heavy petal\nIt's real nigga flowin' through my blood and every vessel\nTime is money, so I saved the load on every bezel\nI just had a dream, I dipped my watch canary yellow\nI woke up and then I bought that bitch in every yellow\nLet go back to business, my fits Prada for my Devil\nCause life's a bitch with red lipstick and high stilettos\nFlaco jumpin' fences from pigs, with 'em them biscuits\nI hypnotized my Sig, but my .38 was kinda special\nWhat a life this is, what a sight this is\nWhere the darks and the light skin kids\nGet along with the white persons\nAll alike when the lights get dim\nOn a righteous pass, where you don't look back\nNigga spark your cig, niggas light your hash\nNiggas light your spliff, where you puff, don't pass, just sit\n\nI just had an epic dream like Dr. King\nPolice brutality was on my TV screen\nHarmony, love, drugs and peace is all we need\nHarmony, love, drugs

bumpin' heavy metal\nDo this for myself, of course my hood and every ghetto\nPaper pushin', paper petal, cause I heavy petal\nIt's real nigga flowin' through my blood and every vessel\nTime is money, so I saved the load on every bezel\nI just had a dream, I dipped my watch canary yellow\nI woke up and then I bought that bitch in every yellow\nLet go back to business, my fits Prada for my Devil\nCause life's a bitch with red lipstick and high stilettos\nFlaco jumpin' fences from pigs, with 'em them biscuits\nI hypnotized my Sig, but my .38 was kinda special\nWhat a life this is, what a sight this is\nWhere the darks and the light skin kids\nGet along with the white persons\nAll alike when the lights get dim\nOn a righteous pass, where you don't look back\nNigga spark your cig, niggas light your hash\nNiggas light your spliff, where you puff, don't pass, just sit\n\nI just had an epic dream like Dr. King\nPolice brutality was on my TV screen\nHarmony, love, drugs and peace

fine\nWaiting here to find the sign\nThat I should take it slow\nHere I go, here I go, here I go...\n\nOff again, there he go\nTo another dimension, my mind\nBody, soul imprisoned, my eye\nProlly

killa, and I'm a jiggy nigga\n\nRocking, rolling, swagging to the max\nMy bitch a fashion killa, she be busy popping tags\nShe got a lotta Prada, that Dolce and Gabbana\nI can't forget Escada, and that Balenciaga\nI'm sipping purple syrup, come be my Aunt Jemima\nAnd if you is a rider, we'll go shopping like ma\u00f1ana\nHer attitude Rihanna, she get it from her mama\nShe jiggy like Madonna, but she trippy like Nirvana\nCause everything designer, her jeans is Helmut Lang\nShoes is Alexander Wang and her shirt the newest Donna\nKaran, wearing all the Cartier frames\nJean Paul Gaultiers cause they match with her persona\n\nHer pistol go \"bang-bang, boom-boom, pop-pop\"\nHer pistol go \"bang-bang, boom-boom, pop-pop\"\nI said her pistol go \"bang-bang, boom-boom, pop-pop\"\nCause she

by the trunk, her Isabel Marant\nI love your Linda Farrow, I adore your Dior\nYour Damir Doma, Vena Cava from the store\nI crush down with that top down, bossy see how I ride 'round\nMami in that Tom Ford, Papi in that Thom Browne\nRick Owens, Raf Simons, boy she got it by the stock\nShe ball until she fall, that means she shop 'til she drop\nAnd Versace: got a lot, but she may never wear it\nBut she save it so our babies will be flyer than their parents\n\nHer pistol go \"bang-bang, boom-boom, pop-pop\"\nHer pistol go \"bang-bang, boom-boom, pop-pop\"\nI said her pistol go \"bang-bang,

\"bang-bang, boom-boom, pop-pop\"\nCause she a fashion killa, and I'm a jiggy nigga\n\nScoop back tees, breeze in coupe\nSmiling is your treasure, you're so well put together\nBags and links, jeans and shoes\nSpikes and patent leathers, different fabrics mixed together\nYou and me, me and you\nGo away together, we could get away forever\nAll emotions clashing, thrashing, someone turn the light out\nI met my baby expressed my passion on my fashion night out\n\nHer pistol go \"bang-bang, boom-boom, pop-pop\"\nHer pistol go \"bang-bang, boom-boom, pop-pop\"\nI said her pistol go \"bang-bang,

punch, drunk, and love it, no buggy?\nEyes bloody when we out in public\nI'm hubby, she say she love me\nWasted money on syrup and honey, she think she Duffy\nThen I became a druggy, enhanced my fame and money\nAnd for your pain and suffering, my karma's waiting for me\nExpecting payments from me\nBut she won't get a damn thing from me\nShe just might get a band aid from me\nYou swear the Benz and these bands ain't from me\n\nI know I'm a scumbag and now your heart broke\nThe night is still young, for you to sip and whine\n(Slow, slow, slow) Lemme see you whine\n(Slow, slow, slow, oh yeah)\nI know your heart is broken, pick up your wine glass\nWith your fine ass, before you whine fast whine slow\n(Slow, slow, slow) Lemme see you whine\n(Slow, slow, slow, oh yeah)\n\nThis love, this love, this love won't last forever\nThis love, this love, this love gon' own our eyes\n\nHow the fuck am I supposed to live?\nHow many fucks am I supposed to give?\nHow the fuck am I supposed to feel?\nTreated like a bill, cut the check and split\nTell your new bitch she can suck a dick\nTell your new bitch she can suck a dick\nTell your new bitch she can suck a dick\nTell your new bitch she can suck a dick\n\nYou the one that was putting up with me\nYou see how these streets corrupted me\nI gotta conquer everything in front of me\nEven though I broke your heart, how can you turn on me?\nWe with the shits on the real\nI do this shit on the real, I like them drinks on the real\nI fuck your bitch on the real\nWe do this shit on the real, keep it real on the real\nI was just keeping it G, she don't spend money at first\nSay you're in love with me, but I know it never gon' work\nI come through, top back, hangin' out the Vert\nEyes screwed up, I'm drinkin' syrup\nI know that look that you givin' me\nIt's killing you softly mentally\n\nI know I'm a scumbag and now your heart broke\nThe night is still young, for you to sip and whine\n(Slow, slow, slow) Lemme see you whine\n(Slow, slow, slow, oh yeah)\nI know your heart is broken, pick up your wine glass\nWith your fine ass, before you whine fast whine slow\n(Slow, slow, slow) Lemme see you whine\n(Slow, slow,

Tiffany, she flossy\nAin't concerned with who bought these\nCan't forget that she bossy\n\nWhen y'all was buying surfboards trying to ride the wave\nI was cooking up another fucking tidal wave (brrrr)\nHad to get entitled motherfuckers out the way\nHad to take another title, sorry for the wait\nBarely ever took a break on, fashion like my time need\nMore hours in a day, I apologize if I'm late\nDoctor Vane, whoa, barely look like I'm awake\nDarker shades, bluer veins, bluer money in the bank (roll)\n\nFuck home, fuck sleep, come clean, zonin'\nCan't forget that I'm golden, can't forget

Ricky Owens\nEyes lookin' like he rollin'\nGot new bags under my eyelids\nNew bags up in my closets\nNew bags like I went shoppin'\nNew bags on new bags\nMind's better at seeing two now, needing up on my downtime\nHit the waves with the new sound, house tunes but its screwed down\nThat's dope (sauce)\nTake a sec to thank the Lord, 'nother one to call my folks\nHit my momma on the phone, she like, \"Son you the boss\"\nFocus, don't get caught up in the moment\nCan't forget that I'm golden, don't forget that I'm chosen\n\nFuck home, fuck sleep, come clean, zonin'\nCan't forget that I'm golden,

awesome, better back the fuck up off me\nCoco, Celine, Tiffany, she flossy\nAin't concerned with who bought these\nCan't forget that she bossy\n\nWhen y'all was buying surfboards trying to ride the wave\nI was cooking up another fucking tidal wave (brrrr)\nHad to get entitled motherfuckers out the way\nHad to take another title, sorry for the wait\nBarely ever took a break on, fashion like my time need\nMore hours in a day, I apologize if I'm late\nDoctor Vane, whoa, barely look like I'm awake\nDarker shades, bluer veins, bluer money in the bank (roll)\n\nFuck home, fuck sleep, come clean, zonin'\nCan't forget that I'm golden, can't forget where I'm going\nFuck popo, police, enemies, fake homies\nCan't forget that I'm a OG, better act like you know it\n\nI remember I was poor and\nWhen I was young and living homeless\nNow I rock the Ricky Owens\nEyes lookin' like he rollin'\nGot new bags under my eyelids\nNew bags up in my closets\nNew bags like I went shoppin'\nNew bags on new bags\nMind's better at seeing two now, needing up on my downtime\nHit the waves with the new sound, house tunes but its screwed down\nThat's dope (sauce)\nTake a sec to thank the Lord, 'nother one to call my folks\nHit my momma on the phone, she like, \"Son you the boss\"\nFocus, don't get caught up in the moment\nCan't forget that I'm golden, don't forget that I'm chosen\n\nFuck home, fuck sleep, come clean, zonin'\nCan't forget that I'm golden, can't forget where I'm going\nFuck popo, police, enemies, fake homies\nCan't forget that I'm a OG, better act like you know it\n\nThey called me a witch, burned me like saffron\nMy matter is golden, a child of the odyssey\nMy touch is righteous, like virus my Midas\nI'm golden\nHe told me when I'm present I'm chosen\nSo hold me tight, I swear, I'm golden\n\nFuck home, fuck sleep, come clean, zonin' (golden)\nCan't forget that I'm golden, can't forget where I'm going\nFuck popo, police, enemies, fake homies (golden)\nCan't forget that I'm a

Six shit, bitches\nA 50 box of them Swishers, gold slabs on them 6's\nIn the back seat full of bitches, tryna hit licks, we gon' get lit\n\nWe about to get lit, get, get lit, get, get lit\nGet lit,

because you gotta smoke this\nI gotta focus when I pour it cause it's kinda potent\n(She like them all gold slugs) No diamonds on it\nI chunk the deuce, I'm coming down and I be riding spokes and\nI

one will get hurt\n\u2018Cause I don't know how long I can hold my heart in two\n\nA rebel I be one day, on that track with Gunplay\nOutcast my whole life so I decide to spit like Andr\u00e9\nBeef is on my entree, gin and juice, that's Bombay\nDriving fast the wrong way, I swear life is like a one-way\nPussy on a Sunday, business on a Monday\nMy new crib came with feng shui and my closet is like a runway\nCome be my fiancee, she fuck me in a Hyundai\nMy rooftop got a lounge, just sit around and watch her sunbathe\nDinner date for one K, shopping date for two K\nBougie-ass bitch made me wait to fuck for two days\nFinally got it today, swear to god my mood changed\nTop off like toupees, drop off, touche\nYeah, my mouth is full of gold and I'm a city boy\nAnd my outfit was in Vogue, I'm a pretty boy\nBounce, boy, Flacko tell 'em holla at a nigga, G\nRiding on my enemies, this my ghetto symphony\n\nDon't come in any closer\nDon't come in any closer\nDon't come in any closer\nDon't come in any closer\n\nWhipping Whitney, my mama as a witness\nBitches lickin' and locking up my swishas\nOnce she blow my whistle, she know it's dismissal\nSpread the news I'm official, now hop out my foreign vessel\nBefore I get aggressive forget it, war ready\nAlready tested, tears and blood invested\nTill my cardiac's arrested and my 40 ounce is empty\nShow me what you owe me and a porterhouse with that\nBlack magic on the tires only I\nRolling down a lonely mile, phony smile\nWarrants, police on me now, still tourin'\nAnd my chain it may slow me down cheer for\nPain, in its purest form\nDon't complain I came to reign from here forward, still noid\nSo crib got clear doors\nBurning planes in my Air Force and all I can see is clear ports\n\nDon't come in any closer\nDon't come in any closer\nDon't come in any closer\nDon't come in any closer...\n\nSince Rocky spit like Andr\u00e9, I'm gon' kill 'em like Big Boi\nThese rappers is on my entr\u00e9e, eat 'em like cookies, Chips Ahoy\nMm, enjoy, when I get annoyed, know a couple niggas that'll kill for joy\nEither Gunplay, runway, trip avoid, body get found by a lil' fishin' boy\nArnold Schwarzenigga, toss a nigga\nLike codeine mixed with a roid\nSlow punch make a nigga chin collide\nThat's for talking how fast you could grip a nine\nDamn, look how the hollow tip hit his spine\nLittle motherfuckers that commit the crime\nThese niggas got the sidewalk sipping wine\nGuess that's why the ground sip the wine\nPouring liq so I soak in lift and shine\nTip tipped and toe I miss the sky\nMy soul gets cold when my niggas died\nSo and so, niggas live and die\nBeneath shoe soles you will reside\nRappers get a mil for these freakin' lies\nSign a couple deals for these freakin' lies\nHow many times in your eyes has a nigga died? Never!\nSpittin' it like a Beretta, nobody do it better, nigga", "image": "https://images.genius.com/75621d1119a70043aadbe3fbf4387d88.640x640x1.jpg", "artist": "A$AP Rocky", "raw":

with Gunplay\nOutcast my whole life so I decide to spit like Andr\u00e9\nBeef is on my entree, gin and juice, that's Bombay\nDriving fast the wrong way, I swear life is like a one-way\nPussy on a Sunday, business on a Monday\nMy new crib came with feng shui and my closet is like a runway\nCome be my fiancee, she fuck me in a Hyundai\nMy rooftop got a lounge, just sit around and watch her sunbathe\nDinner date for one K, shopping date for two K\nBougie-ass bitch made me wait to fuck for two days\nFinally got it today, swear to god my mood changed\nTop off like toupees, drop off, touche\nYeah, my mouth is full of gold and I'm a city boy\nAnd my outfit was in Vogue, I'm a pretty boy\nBounce, boy, Flacko tell 'em holla at a nigga, G\nRiding on my enemies, this my ghetto symphony\n\nDon't come in any closer\nDon't come in any closer\nDon't come in any closer\nDon't come in any closer\n\nWhipping Whitney, my mama as a witness\nBitches lickin' and locking up my swishas\nOnce she blow my whistle, she know it's dismissal\nSpread the news I'm official, now hop out my foreign vessel\nBefore I get aggressive forget it, war ready\nAlready tested, tears and blood invested\nTill my cardiac's arrested and my 40 ounce is empty\nShow me what you owe me and a porterhouse with that\nBlack magic on the tires only I\nRolling down a lonely mile, phony smile\nWarrants, police on me now, still tourin'\nAnd my chain it may slow me down cheer for\nPain, in its purest form\nDon't complain I came to reign from here forward, still noid\nSo crib got clear doors\nBurning planes in my Air Force and all I can see is clear ports\n\nDon't come in any closer\nDon't come in any closer\nDon't come in any closer\nDon't come in any closer...\n\nSince Rocky spit like Andr\u00e9, I'm gon' kill 'em like Big Boi\nThese rappers is on my entr\u00e9e, eat 'em like cookies, Chips Ahoy\nMm, enjoy, when I get annoyed, know a couple niggas that'll kill for joy\nEither Gunplay, runway, trip avoid, body get found by a lil' fishin' boy\nArnold Schwarzenigga, toss a nigga\nLike codeine mixed with a roid\nSlow punch make a nigga chin collide\nThat's for talking how fast you could grip a nine\nDamn, look how the hollow tip hit his spine\nLittle motherfuckers that commit the crime\nThese niggas got the sidewalk sipping wine\nGuess that's why the ground sip the wine\nPouring liq so I soak in lift and shine\nTip tipped and toe I miss the sky\nMy soul gets cold when my niggas died\nSo and so, niggas live and die\nBeneath shoe soles you will reside\nRappers get a mil for these freakin' lies\nSign a couple deals for these freakin' lies\nHow many times in your eyes has a nigga died? Never!\nSpittin' it like a Beretta, nobody do it better, nigga"}}, {"title": "Goldie", "album": "LONG.LIVE.A$AP", "year": "2012-04-27", "lyrics": "I said it must be cause a nigga got dough\nExtraordinary swag and a mouth full of gold\nHoes at my shows they be strippin' off they clothes\nAnd them college girls write a nigga name on they toes\nNiggas talk shit 'til they get lockjaw\nChrome to ya dome 'til ya get glockjaw\nParty like a cowboy or a rockstar\nEverybody play the tough guy 'til shit pop off\n\nLet's take it to the basis, you in the midst of greatness\nMy Martin was a Maison, rocked Margielas with no laces\nCristal go by the cases, wait hold up that was racist\nI would prefer the Aces, ain't no different when you taste it\nA 40 ounce to chase it, that's just a understatement\nI'm early to the party, but my 'Rari is the latest\nSomehow it seems girls in they late teens\nRemind me your favorite jeans cause they naked cause you famous\nLife's a mothafucka, ain't it?

glockjaw\nParty like a cowboy or a rockstar\nEverybody play the tough guy 'til shit pop off\n\nLet's take it to the basis, you in the midst of greatness\nMy Martin was a Maison, rocked Margielas with no laces\nCristal go by the cases, wait hold up that was racist\nI would prefer the Aces, ain't no different when you taste it\nA 40 ounce to chase it, that's just a understatement\nI'm early to the party, but my 'Rari is the latest\nSomehow it seems girls in they late teens\nRemind me your favorite jeans cause they naked cause you famous\nLife's a mothafucka, ain't it? These other rappers ain't us\nSo tell me what your name is, I'mma tell it to my stainless\nYou aim it 'fore you bang it let that banger leave you brainless\nIt's just me, myself, and I and mothafuckas that I came with\nMiscellaneous niggas wanna hate on me\nUntil I tell 'em to they face they ain't no G\nLow key, niggas mad cause I'm smooth puffin' Zig Zags\nTell 'em quit the riff raff bitchin' with your bitch ass\n\nI said it must be cause a nigga got dough\nExtraordinary swag and a mouth full of gold\nHoes at my shows they be strippin' off they clothes\nAnd them college girls write a nigga name on they toes\nNiggas talk shit 'til they get lockjaw\nChrome to ya dome 'til ya get glockjaw\nParty like a cowboy or a rockstar\nEverybody play the tough guy 'til shit pop off\n\nYes, I'm the shit, tell me do it stink?\nIt feel good wakin' up some money in the bank\nThree model bitches, cocaine on the sink\nAnd I'm so 'bout it 'bout it, I might roll up in a tank\nCause my chain came from Cuba, got a lock up on the link\nAnd them red bottom loafers just to complement the mink\nEyes chink, rollin' up that dank, blowin' on that stank\nWhat you mean? Tell me what you drink, I'm on that kissin' pink\nYou could call me Billy Gates, got a crib in every state\nMan on the moon, got a condo out in space\nOpen up your legs, tell me how it taste\nAnd them niggas talkin' shit so tell 'em, \"Tell it to my face\"\nTell that bitch, hop up on my dick, rolled up on her quick\nIn a six, told her suck a dick, motorboat her tits\nI'm the shit, niggas mad cause I'm smooth puffin' Zig-Zags\nTell 'em quit the riff raff bitchin' with your bitch ass\n\nI said it must be cause a nigga got dough\nExtraordinary swag and a mouth full of gold\nHoes at my shows they be strippin' off they clothes\nAnd them college girls write a nigga name on they toes\nNiggas talk shit 'til they get lockjaw\nChrome to ya dome 'til ya get glockjaw\nParty like a cowboy or a rockstar\nEverybody play the tough guy 'til shit pop off\nEverybody play the tough guy 'til shit pop off"}}, {"title": "Goldie Mack", "album": "Waka Flocka Myers 8", "year": null, "lyrics": "808 Mafia\nCozy boys\n\nCar from overseas with four pipes\nMet her in the club, I'ma fuck tonight\nAll my niggas felons, damn right\nNigga what the fuck you sellin'?

every year I go, hear me?\nBig dick, that's my man\nKeep forty bitches round, bring 'em everywhere I go\nHear me? Hear me? Chilling on a boat\nIn the south of France, island happened off the coast\nSaint-Tropez when I'm waving to the folks\nGot the young trap lord with me looking like the Pope, hear me?\nGrew up living broke\nBefore we'd seen it all, niggas had to dream it all\nDon't you compare me cause there ain't nobody near me\nThey don't see me but they feel me\nThey don't feel me but they feel me, they hear me\n\nHear me?\nYoung niggas doing what it takes to survive\nHear me?\nYoung niggas only pay attention if it's fly\nHear me?\nAll I ever hope to do is prosper when I strive\nHear me?\nIf they ain't playing in the game then they hating on the side\nHear me?\n\nBlack dark shades, black leather jacket\nBad chick on my arm got me looking like The Fonz, hear me?\nWe the champions and about to get a ring same size as LeBron's, hear me? Hear me?\nYeah, life is a bitch and it's no holds barred, every man for themselves, hear me? Hear me?\nAnd if you ain't a man and your name ain't Solange\nKeep your hands to yourself, hear me?\nBut I don't know them grown folks' business\nThe thoughts that they plant like it's photosynthe-sis\nIn your bits, put their nose all in it\nI bring 'em to the light with my photogenics\nHear me? Fuck all those critics\nIf Flacko on the booth, that mean a killer on the loose, ooh\nDon't you compare me cause there ain't nobody near me\nThey don't see me but they feel me\nThey don't feel me but they fear me, they hear me\n\nHear me? Hear me?\nYoung niggas doing what it takes to survive\nHear me? Hear me?\nYoung niggas only pay attention if it's fly\nHear me? Hear me?\nAll I ever hope to do is prosper when I strive\nHear me?\nIf they ain't playing in the game then they hating on the side\n\nUh, third verse, turn to third gear\nI left a couple things out like the third wheel\nThese niggas lying on tracks without a third rail\nCause yeah, I'm only stating facts when I'm saying on wax\nIn your ear like I'm cleaning out the wax\nThey don't hear me like they're deaf, \"it was wack\", was dirt there?\nHear me? Yes, I gotta talk about the trap\nMatter of fact, let me talk about rap cause I've served here\nYeah, hear me? Hear me?\nMan, fuck the bullshit cause now I'm in my zone, hear me? Hear me?\nI hear the same bullshit in every other song, hear me?\nSo I try to give 'em something different, listen when I'm on, hear me?

I'll abide by it soon\nSee the situation we\ufeff sophisticated goons\nI know you live by the gun then you die by it too\nNiggas call me prophecy, swagging and philosophies\nWhite on white wagon, call that motherfucker Socrates\nRat ass niggas, fighting for a block of cheese\nCatch me out in China stunting yea I'm about my guapanese\nMy shoe game serious, so serious, Wapanese\nNiggas say I'm blessed my bad I forgot to sneeze (achoo)\nThere your reasons go bitch\nI got some tissues for your issues tell 'em blow this\nBitch!\n\nMake my money, walk straight ahead now\nThey countin' every day

Stop it now\nThey ask me why I don't go to church no more\n'Cause church is the new club and wine is the new bub\nAnd lies is the new drugs, my sister the next stripper\nMy brother the next victim, my usher the next tricker\nSatan givin' out deals, finna own these rappers\nThe game is full of slaves and they mostly rappers\nYou sold your soul first, then your homies after\nLet's show these stupid field niggas they could own they masters\nHoly smokes, I think my pastor was the only folk\nTo own the Rollie, Ghost and Rolls Royces with no Holy Ghost\nAnd get your shit prepared, face your fears, all you niggas scared\nSay your prayers, pray you fit upstairs, it's our only hope\n\nChurch bells and choir sounds, tell 'em, \"Quiet down\"\nBow your head, the Most High's around, Lord\n(These things are not right, these things is not right) Lord\n(Hell, nobody's ever defined) Lord\nThe pastor had a thing for designer glasses\nYeah, I'm talkin' fancy plates and diamond glasses\nThe ushers keep skimmin' the collection baskets\nAnd they tryna dine us with some damn wine and crackers\n\nWho's more important than your Lord and Savior?\nWon't let the pearly gates up in this\nProbably due to all your poor behavior\nMy mental got a couple tips to save ya\nJust be sure to count it as my only favor, thank me later\nUh, every night I stayed up sayin' prayer, made me greater, uh\nLet's savior chasin' green for collard greens and baked potatoes\nOn the table, pray for cable, hit the label, now we major\nHa, I got my own relationship with God, Lord\n\nHoly Ghost, I'm on my knees, I'm on my knees\nHoly Ghost, you're all I need, you're all I need\nHoly Ghost, I'm on my knees, I'm on my knees\nHoly Ghost, you're all I need, you're all I need\nHoly Ghost, I'm on my knees, I'm on my knees"}}, {"title": "Houston Old Head", "album": "LIVE.LOVE.A$AP", "year": "2011-10-31", "lyrics": "Smoking rolling reefer up, I adjust the tweakers up\nBreak it, break it down, break it down so I can beat it up\nWhere the welcome back? Where the welcome mat? My sneaker tough\nThis is for my old head go on turn your speakers up\nRocky, where you been? I been tryna make my ends meet\nSo I can cop that Bathing Ape or Jeremy Scott or 10 Deep\nBottles full of Rose, riding in the Benz jeep\nBlowing money fast, now I'm finna think I'm Big Meech\nI met with my old head we sat for a while\nWe rolled a couple swishers, we chat for a while\nI said I'm just on my grind I come to Houston all the time\nHe said what's been goin' down in your New York state of mind\nFine, you ever got days you feel like giving up\nLike how you gon' eat when this gig is up\nWhen the chips is down and the jig is up\nBut I don't give a fuck, roll another swisher up\nCause I just came here down South so I could get these pounds out\nAnd move my mother nice somewhere closer than a town house\nAnd my beats banging, kicking harder than a roundhouse\nI spoke with my old head and this is what I found out\n\nLife is just a bitch, a bitch is like a ho\nHoes want the money, money come and goes\nFriends turn to foes, foes they be fake\nIf you listen when ya old head talkin' you'll be straight\n\nNow my old head old age bald head rogaine\nCode red codeine, nose red cocaine\nPimpin bitches since lemon chicken shrimp lo mein\nGold chains afros platforms soul train\nAnd he told me 'bout that rapping trapping in the old days\nWhen Pac hung with Suge before that rat tat tat tat nose rings\nAnd I'm so high I could fuck around and grow wings\nAnd we sipping on something purpler than Soul Plane\nWe sip slow, slow swing, tip foes and chrome wings\nTold me I should head home and do my own thang\nThen I heard my phone rang, hold up that's my old dame\nPick it up I hit you back, miss me and I miss you back\nShe said Harlem miss you too and they can't wait to get you back\nYou should come on home leave the drugs alone and stick to rap\nJust don't come back flossin

work\nFrom the cradle to the grave, I'ma put in work\n\nUh-huh, yeah, uh-huh\nAll year long bruh, stuck up in my zone all by my lonesome\nPay the hoe my dues, I brought my own funds\nWhen it's time to war, I brought my own guns\nDifference is I'm ghetto but I'm wholesome\nNigga say I switched up like I'm on some\nWhy you always treat me like I owe some?\nTruthfully you only wanna hold some\nWhip it like I've been a slave\nBucking from the twelve like I've been afraid\nHold up, roll up, burn out, couple minutes saved\nKept a pre-paid on my hip them days, 143rd in front on Minisink\nCam'ron had us wearing pink, from the cradle to the grave\nPutting work, hustle round the corner where my nana stay\nCouldn't work, open up shop from the corner store\nMake 'em renovate where the killas stand\nFuck a lemonade but they cook it by the Minute Maid\nCouple niggas hate\nBut the best form of flattery is when you imi-\nWhen you imitate, ayy\n\nTell me how it gonna be\nGet like me, tell me how it's gonna, how it's gonna be\nTell me how it gonna be\nLike me, tell me how it's gonna be\nTell me how it gonna be, oh\nI'ma have a ball, I'ma cop it all, I'ma buy the store\nTell me how it gonna be\nI'ma go ball, cradle to the grave\nBusy gettin' paid, niggas don't shade, nigga I'ma have it\u2013\n\nFrom the cradle to the grave, I'ma put in work\nFrom the cradle to the grave, I'ma put in work\nFrom the cradle to the grave, I'ma put in work\nFrom the cradle to the grave, I'ma put in work\n\nWith my back against the wall, nigga, I'ma ball\nShow you how to ball, got it with the squad (yeah)\nNever had a job, but I kept a broad\nWhen I went in Saks, went and copped it all\nMy cougars had me lit, kept a PYT\nYour mama on my dick, prettier than a bitch\nAnd I'm overseas, and I had a ball\nSeein' overseas hoes (really litty lit, uh)\nWe ain't counterfeit like we have face tats, how you name go when\nWhere your hoes, why your chain don't spin?\nLight them up, really like 'em all\nNigga, like it all, nigga, like it, tell her get like me\n\nTell me how it gonna be\nGet like me, tell me how it's gonna, how it's gonna be\nTell me how it gonna be\nLike me, tell me how it's gonna be\nTell me how it gonna be, ohh\nI'ma have a ball, I'ma cop it all, I'ma buy the store\nTell me how it gonna be\nI'ma go ball, cradle to the grave\nBusy gettin' paid, niggas don't shade, nigga I'ma have

every time you leave\nAlways come back \u2018cause you wanna fuck\nAlways come back \u2018cause you wanna fuss\nHoldin\u2019 back, ain\u2019t no turnin\u2019 back when you fall in love\nKnow what happens every time you speed\nAlways fall flat \u2018cause you wanna rush\nSo we could take it slow\nSeparate the highs from the lows\nSeparate the evens from the odds\nI just hope you put me back together when I come apart\n\nI come apart, and you keep it together\nI come apart, and I can\u2019t stand the pressure\nIn all your grace and favor for me, I cannot compare\nI come apart, this can\u2019t last forever\nCan\u2019t last forever\n\nI woke up today high\nFelt a little less pressure from you\nAnd I\u2019m here to say I\nMaybe even learned a lesson from you\nIf you find a way to fight the pain which we endure\nIf you fly away then rest assured\n\nI come apart, and you keep it together\nI come apart, and I can\u2019t stand the pressure\nIn all your grace and favor for me, I cannot compare\nI come apart, this can\u2019t last forever\nCan\u2019t last forever\n\nYou\u2019re the eye, but I\u2019m tearing all the time\nAlways there to catch me, but I\u2019m never coming down\nReconstructing all the pieces I left in my way\nI guess you know, in control\nChaos I create\nI come apart\n\nYou made a bet with me, now you\u2019re in debt with me\nMade my bed, lied in it, then you slept with me\nIt\u2019s ruthless, she the closest thing next to me\nThe truth is, that she blew it and you left with me\nEspecially hard to express to me\nEuropean attitude but born in West Philly\nShe just have a smokin\u2019 \u2018gina, where the Wet Willies?\nI come apart, I\u2019m in her heart on her left titty\n\nI come apart, and you keep it together\nI come apart, and I can\u2019t stand the pressure\nIn all your grace and favor for me, I cannot compare\nI come apart, this can\u2019t last forever\nCan\u2019t last forever", "image":

love\nKnow what happens every time you speed\nAlways fall flat \u2018cause you wanna rush\nSo we could take it slow\nSeparate the highs from the lows\nSeparate the evens from the odds\nI just hope you put me back together when I come apart\n\nI come apart, and you keep it together\nI come apart, and I can\u2019t stand the pressure\nIn all your grace and favor for me, I cannot compare\nI come apart, this can\u2019t last forever\nCan\u2019t last forever\n\nI woke up today high\nFelt a little less pressure from you\nAnd I\u2019m here to say I\nMaybe even learned a lesson from you\nIf you find a way to fight the pain which we endure\nIf you fly away then rest assured\n\nI come apart, and you keep it together\nI come apart, and I can\u2019t stand the pressure\nIn all your grace and favor for me, I cannot compare\nI come apart, this can\u2019t last forever\nCan\u2019t last forever\n\nYou\u2019re the eye, but I\u2019m tearing all the time\nAlways there to catch me, but I\u2019m never coming down\nReconstructing all the pieces I left in my way\nI guess you know, in control\nChaos I create\nI come apart\n\nYou made a bet with me, now you\u2019re in debt with me\nMade my bed, lied in it, then you slept with me\nIt\u2019s ruthless, she the closest thing next to me\nThe truth is, that she blew it and you left with me\nEspecially hard to express to me\nEuropean attitude but born in West Philly\nShe just have a smokin\u2019 \u2018gina, where the Wet Willies?\nI come apart, I\u2019m in her heart on her left titty\n\nI come apart, and you keep it together\nI come apart, and I can\u2019t stand the pressure\nIn all your grace and favor for me, I cannot compare\nI come apart, this can\u2019t last forever\nCan\u2019t last forever"}}, {"title": "In Distress", "album": "Divergent (Original

we met\nBody dripping sweat, eat that, beat that pussy wet\nPurple silhouettes, purple drank and cigarettes\nShe is my addiction, nigga need a Nicorette\nTrill-ass misses, fuck her where a nigga rest\nASAP tat cause that's what a nigga rep\nStyle fresh to death, show you bitches how to flaunt\nAnd the Yves St. Laurent, or her Isabel Marant\nLike when Jay Z out, tryna take B out\nAll these magazines try to play me out\nAll my ex-girls tryna fade me out\nBy the ending I was finished, so it's crazy how\nIt's so easy to fall in love\nIt's so easy to fall in love\nOkay wait, now hold up, let me switch that flow up\nCall her to come over and you just try to control her\nEver since I growed up, I been got my dough up\nNow I'm smoking more blunts and I'm sipping 'til I'm poured up\nTore up from the floor up, tore down from my toes up\nGet throwed 'til I throw up, but I'm pimping like I'm 'sposed to\nGot the illest chocha, reason why I chose her\nMami is a rider and see me I be that roller\nShe hate a rap nigga walking with his nose up\nShe date a rap nigga walking with his toaster\nSo take your picture, get your close-up\nAnother fake imitation, just a poser on a poster\nI did it again for my culture\nWent Tesla roadster, traded it in for a Rover\nJust to get a nigga chauffeured\nDriver pull over, tipping and picking these hoes up\nI'm slipping from feeling this sober\nWindow is rolled up, this purple kissed on my shoulder\nUndress and I sex and I hold her\nCaressing her breast with my head on her chest I'm all on her\nIt's so easy to fall in love\nIt's so

out in Florida\nShoot in Miami, goons out in Georgia\nBeen to New Orleans\nBut still a New Yorker, nigga the talk of\nTown, nigga we bossed up\nBounce, but when you talk to the Lord\nOf course you're forced to\nBow down like a motherfuckin' peasant\nStill that pretty motherfucker\nAnd you know Harlem's what I'm reppin' nigga\n\nFuck them other niggas 'cause I'm down for my niggas\nFuck them other

Lord\n\nGettin' faded, hair gettin' braided, Sophie sniffed a line of ye\nPlayin' spades, bumpin' Jimi Hendrix \"Purple Haze\"\nA 40 to the face, call my homies from around the way\nGive me that pussy, I'll be on my way\nBut grab the jimmy so the bitch don't get no cash up out me\nPretty nigga, I'm a jiggy nigga, ask about me\nFuck niggas talkin' trash about me\nBut you know I toke a gauge, it can make any problem go away\nTalkin' Jay, talkin' Ye, that mean you niggas talkin' cray\nRazor blade across your face, I fix my face then walk away\nI guess then there's nothin' more to say\nTrill nigga to the death, whether Hell or the pearly gates\nI think back to my early days\nWhippin' and pinchin' that broad dough\nIt's a bit different now, switchin' and flippin' that raw flow\nSubstance get me higher, reefer and some fire\nThe devil is a liar, biased preachers shall retire\nJesus walked on water, I'm preachin' to the choir\nLong live A$AP, now bow to your Messiah, bitch!\n\nLet the Lords toast with the Lords\nToast to the Lords\nWhen come Gods, come Lords\nLords! Lords! Lords!\nOh Lord!

I'm a man of my law\nI gotta keep my weight up, but where do I land if I fall?\nBut never mind, I'm fly, you know\n\nAnd shout outs my pretty womens in the spot tonight\nLet em see them fuckin' hands\nAnd for the freaks that love the niggas with the Jeeps\nLex, coupes and the Beamers and the Benz, come again\nWhen my death calls, I pray the Lord accept collect calls\nCause I be playing with these womens like they sex dolls\nCall my Prada prior, cause it's dropping next fall\nDon't you short the next ball, my closet like the Met ball\nShe said, \"I just love it when you speak soft-spoken\nUp in the magazines with your teeth all golden\"\nTook the whole year off just to learn to make beats\nDropped the flames on my release and leave the streets all smokin'\nThat touch your soul music, I get you higher\nGrab your lighter fluid, might add a preacher and a choir to it\nI speak the father's music, hallelujah\nAlways Strive & Prosper, stupid\nEven Montell can't tell you how we do it\nSit back and watch me do it\n\nWhen I'm a man of my word, then I got nothing at all\nSo tell me now does it hurt or is it too late? I'm a man of my law\nI gotta keep my weight up, but where do I land if I fall?\nBut never mind, I'm fly, you know\n\n\nOkay let's get past all the swag trapping and fashion talking\nYou want that take it to gats or keep it in rapping talking\nThey rapping bars it get embarrassed, it actually happens often\nYou my son like my last abortion, I'm just laughing off it\nI changed rap I'm fashion forward, yeah I'm that important\nYou jack my style, she jack me off, and y'all both acting awkward?\nJiggling baby, nah, go ahead bitch\nAin't nothing better than the pretty big forehead bitch\nListen close I got some shit to tell you, motherfuckers get familliar\nIt's not just model bitches on my genitalia\nDid Azalea's from Australia, trips to Venezuela\nCinderella's under my umbrella for different weather\nElla, ella, ay just play it like I didn't tell ya\nNiggas taking pictures any time we get together\nAnd hope to fly away one day just like some love birds\nOnly one word I'm afraid of is the \"love\" word\n\nMore power to you, more power to you my lovely one\nMore power to you, more power to you my lonely one\nMore power to you, more power to you my lovely one\nWhat's up bruh? That all depends\nWith friends like you, who need friends\nSometimes the best advice is no advice\nEspecially when it's your advice\nOh! Man, remember\nYour man was on stage dressed like a family member\nMan everything basic to Ye Guevara\nThat means Saint Laurent is my Zara\nI remember Rochelle ain't wanna fuck me with the polo\nAy bitch you missed out, #fomo\nI got one child, one child\nBut I'm fuckin', fuckin', fuckin' like I'm tryna make four more\nThey wanna throw me under a white jail\n'Cause I'm a black man with confidence

I'm a man of my law\nI gotta keep my weight up, but where do I land if I fall?\nBut never mind, I'm fly, you know\n\nShe the type to seek love and make it everlasting\nI'm the type to wake up and say you never happened\nI mean I fucked the girl with hella passion\nBut it's cold how we smashing, left her sleeping on a separate mattress\nI think her body makes for better practice\nGood excuse for my absence like \"Flacko where your ass been?\nHeard you done with fashion, now yo ass is acting\"\nI'm tripping off the acid, now yo ass is looking massive\nThis ain't the shit equipped with columns from my reckless swagging\nThis that dark house party with this record blasting\nRolling spliffs, clique beside me, fingers Liberace\nWhen I seen this bitch in vintage, Tommy and some mid Huaraches\nI'm all alone though, mood music makes me bop slower\nTrippin' on how I shifted pop culture, changed hip-hop on ya\nSmoking like a rasta was my pop's culture\nI be damned if I die sober, I'll be sure to visit Pac for ya\n\nWhen I'm a man of my word, then I got nothing at all\nSo tell me now does it hurt or is it too late? I'm a man of my law\nI gotta keep my weight up, but where do I land if I fall?\nBut never mind, I'm fly, you know\n\nAnd shout outs my pretty womens in the spot tonight\nLet em see them fuckin' hands\nAnd for the freaks that love the niggas with the Jeeps\nLex, coupes and the Beamers and the Benz, come again\nWhen my death calls, I pray the Lord accept collect calls\nCause I be playing with these womens like they sex dolls\nCall my Prada prior, cause it's dropping next fall\nDon't you short the next ball, my closet like the Met ball\nShe said, \"I just love it when you speak soft-spoken\nUp in the magazines with your teeth all golden\"\nTook the whole year off just to learn to make beats\nDropped the flames on my release and leave the streets all smokin'\nThat touch your soul music, I get you higher\nGrab your lighter fluid, might add a preacher and a choir to it\nI speak the father's music, hallelujah\nAlways Strive & Prosper, stupid\nEven Montell can't tell you how we do it\nSit back and watch me do it\n\nWhen I'm a man of my word, then I got nothing at all\nSo tell me now does it hurt or is it too late? I'm a man of my law\nI gotta keep my weight up, but where do I land if I fall?\nBut never mind, I'm fly, you know\n\n\nOkay let's get past all the swag trapping and fashion talking\nYou want that take it to gats or keep it in rapping talking\nThey rapping bars it get embarrassed, it actually happens often\nYou my son like my last abortion, I'm just laughing off it\nI changed rap I'm fashion forward, yeah I'm that important\nYou jack my style, she jack me off, and y'all both acting awkward?\nJiggling baby, nah, go ahead bitch\nAin't nothing better than the pretty big forehead bitch\nListen close I got some shit to tell you, motherfuckers get familliar\nIt's not just model bitches on my genitalia\nDid Azalea's from Australia, trips to Venezuela\nCinderella's under my umbrella for different weather\nElla, ella, ay just play it like I didn't tell ya\nNiggas taking pictures any time we get together\nAnd hope to fly away one day just like some love birds\nOnly one word I'm afraid of is the \"love\" word\n\nMore power to you, more power to you my lovely one\nMore power to you, more power to you my lonely one\nMore power to you, more power to you my lovely one\nWhat's up bruh? That all depends\nWith friends like you, who need friends\nSometimes the best advice is no advice\nEspecially when it's your advice\nOh! Man, remember\nYour man was on stage dressed like a family member\nMan everything basic to Ye Guevara\nThat means Saint Laurent is my Zara\nI remember Rochelle ain't wanna fuck me with the polo\nAy bitch you missed out, #fomo\nI got one child, one child\nBut I'm fuckin', fuckin', fuckin' like I'm tryna make four more\nThey wanna throw me under a white jail\n'Cause I'm a black man with confidence of a white male\nHallelujah"}}, {"title": "Keep It G", "album": "LIVE.LOVE.A$AP", "year": "2011-10-31", "lyrics": "Fuck the bullshit, my nigga.

ahh\n\nUh, kiss the kids, call you baby daddy\nTell 'em who's daddy\nCall your pappy, tell him that you happy\nShout it loud so they all know how you feel exactly\nInside sunny energize\nThink about it like you feelin' alive\nOn the mama boy, she swear to God\nLady said that she ain't into guys\nBrand new 'cedes with the intercom\nTable made is for the dinner vibe\nAin't a killer so don't kill the vibe\nDisrespect them, that's a different side\nAdderall and alcohol (yeah)\nThe teachers called, the doctor called\nThe block too hot, the marshal called\nSee 'em grow and watch 'em crawl\n\nParents test the wine\nThe kids do the lines\nAhh, alright\nAhh, just fine\nThe kids turned out fine\nThe kids turned and run\nI heard about all of the long trials in life\nAll the drugs on

life\nI introduced her to this hippy life\nWe make love under pretty lights, LSD (Acid)\nI get a feelin' it's a trippy night\nThem other drugs just don't fit me right\nGirl, I really fuckin' want love, sex, dream\nAnother quarter to the face system\nMake no mistakes, it's all, a leap of faith for love\nIt takes a place in, feelin' that you crave doin' love, sex, dreams\n\nIt started in Hollywood\nDreamin' of sharin' love\nMy tongue at a loss for words\nCause my feelings just said it all\nParty just started up\nDreamin' of sharin' worlds\nHeld this feeling for way too long\nSaid, \"I really wanna let it go\"\n\nI've been gettin' fly because the gimmick's so dope\nI've been getting high cause I figured Lord told me\nI've been drinking, driving, now we'll never go home\nI gon' stay in doubt because the weather's so cold, oh\n\nFeeling low sometimes when the light shines down\nMakes me high\nCan you feel it?\nCan you feel it?\nFeeling low sometimes when the light shines down\nMakes me high\nCan you feel it?\nCan you feel it?\n\nIt started in Hollywood\nDuh, duh-duh\nDreamin' of sharin' love\nDuh, duh-duh\nMy tongue at a loss for words\nCause my feelings just said it all\n\nI look for ways to say, \"I love you\"\nBut I ain't into makin' love songs\nBaby I'm just rappin' to this LSD"}}, {"title": "Leaf (Take 1)", "album": "LIVE.LOVE.A$AP", "year": "2011-10-31",

bitches, cause I'm sick of all these sisters\nI'm sick and tired of tryna survive, I'm sick tired of my environment\nI'm sick and tired of feeling deprived, I'm one of a kind, when in my climate\nI'm

I'd rather fuck\nTreat her like my enemy, I just wanna bust\n7 deuce, waiting on the bus\nBefore the boys bend the corner, tryna make a bust\nTryouts, I'm tryna make the bucks\nPurple and the green

partying mothafuckas\"\n\nTired of these rappers, tired of these jackers\nTired of these dances by these fucking backpackers\nAnd I'm sick of all these hipsters, I'm sick of phony niggas\nI'm sticking to these bitches, cause I'm sick of all these sisters\nI'm sick and tired of tryna survive, I'm sick tired of my environment\nI'm sick and tired of feeling deprived, I'm one of a kind, when in my climate\nI'm sick and tired of your facade and all of your lying and all your diamonds\nBasically, I'm tired of feeling sick and tired\nA$AP, born in money makin' Manhattan\nEvery nigga on my block wanna be a Main Attrakion\nShout my nigga Squadda, shout my nigga Mondre\nIf you disrespect them niggas then I'm polishin' the nine-trey\nAnd I'm coming to your casa for your madre and padre\nComprende? Most of these niggas been gay or they strange\nThey say I sound like Andre mixed with Kanye, little bit of Max\nLittle bit of Wiz, little bit of that, little bit of this, get off my dick\n\nI'm in your hood, you ain't got no ticket\nI'mma down to Earth nigga, we could kick it\nTake a hit with me, take a hit with me\nAin't on stage behind the scene, I'm probably mixing lean\nChilling with my niggas, with my team\nCome and take a sip with me, take a sip with me\n\nOnce again, Mister Back Selling Crack\nIt's an honor keeping real nigga music on the map\nStreet raps, new face, sampled with no credits\nDoubting myself cause I don't think the world can relate\nTo my surprise everyone does, so have faith\nHalf of the other side don't live it they push play\nThe young illest alive, Harlem world to the Bay\nIt feels good waking up to money in the bank\nCause last year it was shoe box and lint\nI only write raps just to give you niggas hints\nEvery verse a gift, as you smoke like a chimney\nMy album coming November, that's 20 years of memory\nAnd that's assuming I'mma live that long\nIf I don't, don't cry cause I ain't live that wrong\nJust an artist in a purest form, I live that song\nAn artist in the purest form, I live that song, Bambino\n\nI'm in your hood, you ain't got no ticket\nI'mma down to Earth nigga, we could kick it\nTake a hit with me, take a hit with me\nAin't on stage behind the scene, I'm probably mixing lean\nChilling with my niggas, with my team\nCome and take a sip with me, take a sip with me\n\nWhy fuss? I'd rather fuck\nTreat her like my enemy, I just wanna bust\n7 deuce, waiting on the bus\nBefore the boys bend the corner, tryna make a bust\nTryouts, I'm tryna make the bucks\nPurple and the green got me on stuck\nSo I two-step, move my foot and keep it pushing\nAlways bouncing back, got it keep the cushion\nAnd that's something fat, like eating all the pudding\nA$AP we got it slap, bruh good looking\nFuck That, ASAP where I come from\n456, Ice City slums\nWeed in my pocket, coke in his tongues\nBuying swisher sweets, no more honey buns\nFresh white tee, bright like the sun\nOnly nigga round here rocking \u041c\u0438\u0448\u043a\u0430\n\nI'm in your hood, you ain't got no ticket\nI'mma down to Earth nigga, we could kick it\nTake a hit with me, take a hit with me\nAin't on stage behind the scene, I'm probably mixing lean\nChilling with my niggas, with my team\nCome and take a sip with me, take a sip with me\n\n\"This go out to all the rappers, this go out to the little

had to sign a fucking clothed doll\nNow I need a real doll\nTo come and be my tit drill doll\n\nGive me a beat bruh\nI ain't say shit right now bruh\nC'mon man I need to spit some dope shit bruh\nCause I'm sounding like Malibu's most wanted right now bruh\nTraffic traffic looking for my chapsticks, know what I'm saying\nGive me anything bruh, just give me a beat bruh\nI'm like freeway right now\nThrough a beat on there\n\nFlacco tell me what your name is\nHigh like chains every since you became famous\nAnd you know these bitches in my way they is the lamest\nAnd my old bitches they be always on that same shit\nNiggas who I hang they gang bang way beyond that same shit\nThat gang bang shit and I let my chain switch\nAnd I let the lane switch\nWhen I do this it\u2019s so dangerous\nHit you with that stainless\nNigga why you playing, nigga what you saying\nI be spraying AKs and texting Rolex\nRoll through your jet, show no respect\nThen call a Jeff, no sheriff\nNiggas know I did it for the thrillest\nI don\u2019t give a fuck about your feelings if you feel this\nShout out to my killers we the realest\n100 dollar bills, 4 wheelers out the motherfucking ass\nNigga kiss my ass, your bitch love my swag\nAnd I got money out the ass cash up in a bag\nI remember last year I didn\u2019t have a dime to spare\nNow look at me here\nGot money long as my hair\nGot your bitch on the ware want to see my underwear\nNever give a damn about your fear\nI don\u2019t fear, no I don\u2019t care\nI don\u2019t get no motherfucking hate on my time\nFuck that I\u2019m in the state of my mind\nI\u2019m probably in my prime\nAnd I do this for my leakers\nHoller I need 80k for a feature, nigga\nBleed it out your speakers\nAnd I got them divas\nReese pieces Jesus pieces\nAll up on my, ugh\nGlitter chains and I let the motherfucking cheddar bang\nYou should of shouldn\u2019t came\nI\u2019m with the triller gang"}}, {"title": "Live.Love.A$AP [Mixtape Art]", "album":

parental supervision\nThis be that murder business, little Timmy got that semi\nI ain't kidding hide yo kittens, hit yo children with that Smith and\nA bunch of ignant little niglets, hard headed, never listen\nPurple sippin', finger twistin', teeth glisten like it's Memphis\nA bunch of hypocritic Christians, the land of no religion\nMy Santa Claus was missing, catch you slippin' then it's Christmas\nMotherfuck a wishlist, my ghetto was ambition\nFor my benjis and my Bentley, and them bitches now I gets gets\nOn the road to riches, a diamond ring, designer jeans\nChoking on that biscuit till I'm no longer existing\nI wonder if they miss me, as long as I make history\nNow my soul is feeling empty, tell the reaper come and get me\n\nWho said you can\u2019t live forever lied\nOf course, I\u2019m living forever I\u2019ll\nForever, I\u2019ll live long\nYou can\u2019t ever deny\nMy force, I\u2019m living forever I\u2019ll\nForever, I\u2019ll LIVE\n\nRiding through your city like that motherfucka mine\nOr choking on that semi, rob a motherfucka blind\nLicense plate says wipe me down, car from 1989\nBut a nigga sits so pretty call that motherfucker fine\nLost your motherfucking mind, what's on your mind niggas talking down\nNever talk to cops, make him talk to God when I tote that 9, he ain't talking now\nTell 'em watch your spine, I mean watch your back\nBetter guide your track, better not look back\nNow stay in line, don't step on cracks\nSo you break her back I'm talking 'bout your mom\nCause there's killers in my town, making hits, sniffing lines\nOut committing crimes, wait for shit to simmer down\nCorrupted little minds, 8 and 9, finna shine\nOn the grind, do you dirty with that shimmy shimmy ya\nWhere they shoot without a purpose, services 'n hearses\nKids who ain't deserve it, can't survive a thing, you're worthless\nStrangers make me nervous, who's that peekin' in my window with a pistol to my curtains?\n\nWho said you can\u2019t live forever lied\nOf course, I\u2019m living forever I\u2019ll\nForever, I\u2019ll live long\nYou can\u2019t ever deny\nMy force, I\u2019m living forever I\u2019ll\nForever, I\u2019ll LIVE\n\nPretty nigga rich, Flacko be the shit\nAnd that bitch, know we poppin' so she boppin' on this dick\nNigga, R.I.P. to Pimp, can't forget Little Flip\nAnd I take it out to Memphis so shout out to Triple Six\n\nWho said you

that sniffin', your heroin addiction\nTrigger finger itching fuck parental supervision\nThis be that murder business, little Timmy got that semi\nI ain't kidding hide yo kittens, hit yo children with that Smith and\nA bunch of ignant little niglets, hard headed, never listen\nPurple sippin', finger twistin', teeth glisten like it's Memphis\nA bunch of hypocritic Christians, the land of no religion\nMy Santa Claus was missing, catch you slippin' then it's Christmas\nMotherfuck a wishlist, my ghetto was ambition\nFor my benjis and my Bentley, and them bitches now I gets gets\nOn the road to riches, a diamond ring, designer jeans\nChoking on that biscuit till I'm no longer existing\nI wonder if they miss me, as long as I make history\nNow my soul is feeling empty, tell the reaper come and get me\n\nWho said you can\u2019t live forever lied\nOf course, I\u2019m living forever I\u2019ll\nForever, I\u2019ll live long\nYou can\u2019t ever deny\nMy force, I\u2019m living forever I\u2019ll\nForever, I\u2019ll LIVE\n\nRiding through your city like that motherfucka mine\nOr choking on that semi, rob a motherfucka blind\nLicense plate says wipe me down, car from 1989\nBut a nigga sits so pretty call that motherfucker fine\nLost your motherfucking mind, what's on your mind niggas talking down\nNever talk to cops, make him talk to God when I tote that 9, he ain't talking now\nTell 'em watch your spine, I mean watch your back\nBetter guide your track, better not look back\nNow stay in line, don't step on cracks\nSo you break her back I'm talking 'bout your mom\nCause there's killers in my town, making hits, sniffing lines\nOut committing crimes, wait for shit to simmer down\nCorrupted little minds, 8 and 9, finna shine\nOn the grind, do you dirty with that shimmy shimmy ya\nWhere they shoot without a purpose, services 'n hearses\nKids who ain't deserve it, can't survive a thing, you're worthless\nStrangers make me nervous, who's that peekin' in my window with a pistol to my curtains?\n\nWho said you can\u2019t live forever lied\nOf course, I\u2019m living forever I\u2019ll\nForever, I\u2019ll live long\nYou can\u2019t ever deny\nMy force, I\u2019m living forever I\u2019ll\nForever, I\u2019ll LIVE\n\nPretty nigga rich, Flacko be the shit\nAnd that bitch, know we poppin' so she boppin' on this dick\nNigga, R.I.P. to Pimp, can't forget Little Flip\nAnd I take it out to Memphis so shout out to Triple Six\n\nWho said you can\u2019t live forever lied\nOf course, I\u2019m living forever I\u2019ll\nForever, I\u2019ll live long\nYou can\u2019t ever deny\nMy

hands on me, that's a man down\nTrick, what? Pimps up, hoes down, whoa now\nSlow down, see they runnin' with my old style\nGrow foul, gold smile, you ho now, thuggin' with my old style\nIt's a shame how they low down\nDirty like Adidas on my sneaker feature, uh\nTrappin' through the speaker, peep the beeper ringer, uh\nTurnin' off phones, just to reach 'em, gotta beep 'em\nI'm a Lord motherfucker, better greet him if you see him\n\nLord Pretty Flacko Jodye\nTell these fuck niggas how you been\nYou been crossin' our minds, niggas talk down every now and then\nOn the side, who gave em style 9 times out of 10?\nIt was Flacko, Jodye, Flacko, Jodye\nFlacko, Jodye, Flacko, Jodye", "image": "https://images.genius.com/f079ab6b7ac90efd277c06047c7ec238.1000x1000x1.jpg", "artist": "A$AP Rocky", "raw": {"annotation_count": 18, "api_path":

spot\nCooly nigga, you don\u2019t really want beef\nI\u2019m Biggaveli, I could do this in my sleep\nMy bitch now tryna comfort me\nAnd baby I wonder, baby I wonder\n\nUh, buccaneers of rugged gear, nigga fuck a fair\nOne, since year one, I've been thuggin' here, yeah, uh\nWhole shit is ours, you in awe, please don't get involved\nThis is war, walk around a frame with blaze up in this jawn\nBehind prison walls, niggas lickin' balls, pause\nDifferent cause, stricted laws\nDamn if I don't break up in the mall, prison yard, prison guard\nNo principal, detention on your friends and all\nCommissary missing like your sibling's paw\nUncle Tom, please don't make my sentence long\nGranted what I did was wrong\nPigs don't show remorse if you admit it all\nMissing ma, hope that she don't miss the call\nAdmitted that she'll never visit\nLike the hard headed never listen, Lord\nSo tell me how the fuck I'm supposed to eat?

I've been kickin' back\nRelax place down my favorite thinking cap, scratch my nigga neck\nHitta chit and chat, this and that, A$AP diplomats\nI'm missing Max, wish that they could bring the nigga Bigga back\n\nAnd I wonder, laying in my bed\nAm I still too young? Am I still too young?\nAnd I hold back, thoughts running through my head\nDid I fuck it up? Did I fuck it up?\n\nIt's like I lace up my boots and call my troops lately\nTraded all my hoodie rap for all my suits lately\nI'm 26 but I've been living in my youth lately\nPull my wisdom, but I still spit it like my tooth ache me\nDuck shots, motherfuck cops, what's up blood clots?\nAll I gots my words and my balls and my one cock\nPause, buckshots fly, my young buck died\nPassed away from a stray, from some fake tough guy\nNow this the kind of story that should make doves cry\nFuck that, this the story that should make thugs cry\nDry your eyes older sis, held 'em close, watch 'em twitch\nGave 'em kiss in the midst of all of this\nAin't too late to pause or skip...\n\nAnd I wonder, laying in my bed\nAm I still too young? Am I still too young?\nAnd I hold back, thoughts running through my head\nDid I fuck it up? Did I fuck it up?\n\nI'm Biggaveli, I could do this in my sleep\nBaby I wonder, baby I wonder\n\nAnd I wonder, as I'm laying in my bed\nAm I still too young? Am I still too young?\nAnd I hold back, thoughts running through my head\nDid I fuck it up? Did I fuck it up?\nAnd I wonder, as I'm laying down in bed\nAm I still too young?

write the rules, but my status like the arthur\nJust crashed the Range, so I pull the Bent out\nProlly gettin' brains, chillin' in my Penthouse\nSlackin' on ya mackin', and I'm bout to lay my pimp down\nChristian Louboutin, red bottom come in men's now\nOn to the next one, skinny jeans fit in\nPull up to these shows and these hoes know to get in\nSaid they like my fitted clothes, down to my split ends\nLittle do she know, I got a big ego\nAutomatic weapon, need to order a protection\nKilling feelings on these records\nSo my charges, is molesting\nAssault with deadly weapon got these rappers feeling threatened\nAin't a hip hop veteran I'm a hip hop felon\n(Verse 2 Rocky)\nI need a crib by the mountain\nChest look house lit\nLimbs get frostbit\nBrand new outfit\nIf you less fortunate\nYou really ain't about shit\nSo much cribs a nigga friends got to house sit\nSo much money can't weigh it by the ounce shit\nWeigh it by the pound shit\nToo much to count shit\nPaparazzi taking pictures newspaper topics\nMagazines gossip, villa in the tropics\nRockstar pop shit, made by toxic\nInside hot pink outside gothic\nRag-top roof made of fishnet stockings\nBlack candy paint, look fingernail polish\n(Verse 3 Rocky)\nNo one in this sight has Swag like I do\nChurch with this verse, I'mma hit em with the gospel\nHit em with the rifle, I'm higher than the Eiffel Tower\nHustle harder, snow, sleet, shower\nAge worry about who's hot who's hotter\nLike crabs in the barrel tryna pull you to the bottom\nYou get em I got em\nPoint him out, I stop em\nRed dot em I shot em\nI hot em, you find him\nRoll to the club and I order gold bottles\nShawty get low, but I'm no flo-rida\nAnd this 6-4 spokes like a lowrider\nThe coups so special you could call it mo-rida\nBut I'm a known rider, and I'm a provider\nBlack on black Bent, fire, like the Ghost Rider\nDon't need a ghostwriter\nBecause my flow's tighter\nYour careers nose diving\nI'mma pull an allnighter\nSo hood rich hollywood bitch want me\nDon't look hood but a hood bitch love me\nHood niggas hate Hollywood niggas hate me\nProlly why I never keep the burner off safety\nYou could never ugh, you should never try to play me\nOn a scale of One to Ten, so sick is what they rate me\nNo homo, but these labels wanna rate me\nI tell em four words\nFuck You Pay Me"}}, {"title": "New York Bittersweet Symphony",

impress\nWhat you say, you at left, and I put it to the tec\nTo your brain to the right of your dome blow your brain to the left\nPOP, POW don't give a damn and I came through the town\nLondon town came to shut it down, king of the underground\nRolex on my left arm, - on my right arm\nGot your -itch on my right and we party all night\nLast night I was with Trapstar and you know we party hard\nAnd you know we had some laughs, couple giggles hearty har\nDon't give a F about these chicks\nTell 'em suck a \"ehhh\" cause they on my tip\nWhat you mean I flip, I flip, my watch tick tick, and she tick and tick\nYou don't wanna get in trip, you don't wanna mix with this\nI will fight you, I don't like you, get like lightening what you mean?\nAnd you know I come through in that super six, it sit so clean\nOn your TV screen, it's a dream\nI can't hear nothing, turn it up 'til I scream\nWhere the volume at, put it to the max\nNeed to hear that bounce, bring it back"}}, {"title": "OG

shit\nTaz Arnold TI$A, Jeremy Scott Adidas\nMaison Martin Margiella, three strap sneakers\nRiding with a leacher, student and a teacher\nIt's money over bitches, no room for a skeezer\nThinking of a Lambo, Bathing Ape camo\nPlay with the money, turn Rocky into Rambo\nPatience is a virtue, life is a handful\nFriends, they'll hurt you, learned that from my grandfolks\nMe under a lamp post while I got my hands closed\nHaze to my brains like eggs, got it scrambled\nYeah I feel Rihanna and I understand Hov\nWhat you think I rap for? To push a fucking Land Rove?\nNow I'm looking back when you said I shouldn't rap\nSome slept on me, other niggas took a nap\nNow I'm in the basement, probably cooking crack\nGave you teaspoons full but instead, you took a cap\nThey say Tyga and Diggy but Rocky been Jiggy\nCurren$y from the Wiz ain't enough to get me home\nCan't really hate when they compare me to Drake\nCould have been J. Cole if I met J-Hov\n\n(Who dat? ASAP) But I'm fly like I never left\nYou's a lie, like fly without the letter F\nIf hip hop is dead, fuck it, let it rest\nReincarnated through me when she resurrect\nLong hair, Blue jeans, live on U-Stream\nHigh top boots like Pac in a Juice scene\nNo it ain't a movie, diamonds in by new gleam\nDead tone cause the redbones is my new thing\n\nNigga, I do things, let the coupe sing\nNiggas say I'm insane, Saddam Hussein\nNiggas still jokers, me, I'm on my Bruce Wayne\nFly kicks, my shit, yeah, I'm on that Liu Kang\nI ain't bragging but I do this, my shoes is Bermudas\nI'm bougie in that Gucci but my nudies is my newest\nAnd your foolishness and rumors, I give two shits\nI only hear the money, save the bullshit for the Q-Tips\nSwag is the coolest, my bitch is the rudest\nMy jeweler is Jewish and my wrist is the bluest\nAnd I get it poppin on the block like Whoo Kid\nASAP standing on the block like the new kids"}}, {"title": "Pain", "album": "LONG.LIVE.A$AP", "year": "2013-01-15",

direction\nQuit with all the fronting, you ain't 'round my clique for nothing\nCause our presence is a present, just to kick it is a blessing\n\nThis is the way it goes, this is the way we roll\nCause every day we on our pesos\n(Gun cock, gun shot, gonna lick a boy)\nCause every day we on our pesos\n\nYour bitch just said I'm hot, man I told her I agree\nShe gon' really think I'm hot, if I told her my degrees\nPull up in that hard-top, showing off my keys\nGraduate school of hard-knocks, I can show you my degrees\nCouple A, B, C's, bad bitch, double D's\nPopping E, I don't give a F, told you I'm a G\nA.S.A.P., Stevie got it on his sleeve\nBut I got it on my chest, my nigga, this is what I breathe\nInhale, exhale, cocaine, X pills\nImport, export, Harlem catching rec still\nSo mami show me how that neck feel\nLater show me how the rest feel, for now just chill\n\nThis is the way it goes, this is the way we roll\nCause every day we on our pesos\n(Gun cock, gun shot, gonna lick a boy)\nCause

freshest\nRaf Simons, Rick Owens usually what I'm dressed in\nBlowing blunts rolling doobies up, smoking sections\nGroupies rush hold they boobies up, in my direction\nQuit with all the fronting, you ain't 'round my clique for nothing\nCause our presence is a present, just to kick it is a blessing\n\nThis is the way it goes, this is the way we roll\nCause every day we on our pesos\n(Gun cock, gun shot, gonna lick a boy)\nCause every day we on our pesos\n\nYour bitch just said I'm hot, man I told her I agree\nShe gon' really think I'm hot, if I told her my degrees\nPull up in that hard-top, showing off my keys\nGraduate school of hard-knocks, I can show you my degrees\nCouple A, B, C's, bad bitch, double D's\nPopping E, I don't give a F, told you I'm a G\nA.S.A.P., Stevie got it on his sleeve\nBut I got it on my chest, my nigga, this is what I breathe\nInhale, exhale, cocaine, X pills\nImport, export, Harlem catching rec still\nSo mami show me how that neck feel\nLater show me how the rest feel, for now just chill\n\nThis is the way it goes, this is the way we roll\nCause every day we on our pesos\n(Gun cock, gun shot, gonna lick a boy)\nCause every day we on our pesos"}},

racing\nSomebody's mama's heart is aching, can't take it, partly fainted\nFound his body parts in awkward places\nLike apartments, basements\nGarbage, vacant lots, garages, spaces\nHarlem's far too spacious\nSometimes I wish I could get away and charter spaceships\nTo get away from my inhuman race with hearts of Satans\nKick off my Maison Martin's, lay on back like Martha Mason\nSmoke away my iron lung 'til later die at 71, uhh\n\nI lay down now\nThere's someone's journey in the streets\nWho gotta keep a piece, peace\nI lay down now\nAs I lay me down to sleep\nI pray to God I rest in peace\nI pray to Lord my soul to keep\n\nGentrification split the nation that I once was raised in\nI don't recall no friendly neighbors face on my upraising\nBack in my younger days or razor blades with gangs\nWho bang and never stood a chance\nThem boys don't dance, but left 'em Harlem shaking\nOn the pavement, and my generation fucked, and my society\nVery trippy pages in my diary\nIt's the irony how LSD inspired me to reach the higher me\nUsed to never give a damn, now I don't give a fuck entirely\nI think my pride died in me, somewhere inside of me\nIt's gotta be, awhole 'nother side of me\nIf you seen the shit that I'd have seen in 26 years of living\nThat's how many fucks I'd give (fuck)\n\nLove on the low, love everywhere I go\nAnd I can't face that all I need is right where I belong\n\nI lay down now\nThere's someone's journey in the streets\nWho gotta keep a piece, peace\nI lay down now\nAs I lay me down to sleep\nI pray to God I rest in peace\nSo, so\n\nLove on the low,

right where I belong\nLove on the low, love everywhere I go\nAnd I can't face that all I need is right where I belong\nSo, so\n\nMy ears are ringing, my palms are shaking, my heart is racing\nSomebody's mama's heart is aching, can't take it, partly fainted\nFound his body parts in awkward places\nLike apartments, basements\nGarbage, vacant lots, garages, spaces\nHarlem's far too spacious\nSometimes I wish I could get away and charter spaceships\nTo get away from my inhuman race with hearts of Satans\nKick off my Maison Martin's, lay on back like Martha Mason\nSmoke away my iron lung 'til later die at 71, uhh\n\nI lay down now\nThere's someone's journey in the streets\nWho gotta keep a piece, peace\nI lay down now\nAs I lay me down to sleep\nI pray to God I rest in peace\nI pray to Lord my soul to keep\n\nGentrification split the nation that I once was raised in\nI don't recall no friendly neighbors face on my upraising\nBack in my younger days or razor blades with gangs\nWho bang and never stood a chance\nThem boys don't dance, but left 'em Harlem shaking\nOn the pavement, and my generation fucked, and my society\nVery trippy pages in my diary\nIt's the irony how LSD inspired me to reach the higher me\nUsed to never give a damn, now I don't give a fuck entirely\nI think my pride died in me, somewhere inside of me\nIt's gotta be, awhole 'nother side of me\nIf you seen the shit that I'd have seen in 26 years of living\nThat's how many fucks I'd give (fuck)\n\nLove on the low, love everywhere I go\nAnd I can't face that all I need is right where I belong\n\nI lay down now\nThere's someone's journey in the streets\nWho gotta keep a piece, peace\nI lay down now\nAs I lay me down to sleep\nI pray to God I rest in peace\nSo, so\n\nLove on the low, love everywhere I go\nAnd I can't face that all I need is right where I belong"}}, {"title": "Phoenix", "album": "LONG.LIVE.A$AP", "year": "2013-01-15", "lyrics": "Bloody ink on my pad spelled

Kelly hoes getting pissed on twice\nDamn, how a young nigga get so nice?\nYoung nigga cold like he sitting on ice\nFuck broke, tryna be rich all life\nI coulda been a criminal and just rolled dice\nMy nuts hanging, my top back\nHoes screaming that Pac back\nThrowing Westside, bandana tied\nA$AP life, got a Pac tat\nHarlem world my whole block strapped\nHoes all on my jock strap\nMy whip white but my top black\nAnd my bitch white but my cock black\nPurple drink? Got that\nTell these hoes all to twerk something\nBounce on me bitch, hurt something\nTell her pop that pussy like it's worth something\nSo shorty, she a stunner and daddy, he a runner\nBe that pretty mothafucka, you could call me what you wanna\nCause I'm in love with that ass, she in love with the cash\nSo she shaking it fast and then making them stacks\nAnd I'm taking it back and I'm taking her back\nTo the house just to bust in her mouth and I'm kicking her out\n\nHow 'bout me and you and you and I\nTake a ride to make this high\nOn and on and on and on\nOn and on and on and on\n\nSo I say pussy, money, weed\nPussy, money, weed\nPussy, money, weed\nThat's all a nigga need\n\nIt's A$AP Q, where the bread at?\nFuck around and bring the hush puppies back\nShe fuck me and the homies, she was cool with that\nThe block hot so I'm shaded in my bucket hat\nPause a little bit, I gotta little advice\nIf you fucked her once, then you could fuck her twice\nAnd don't get head from hoes with overbites\nJust giving out game, nigga show your right\nBorn stunna nigga, turn night to bright\nHigh as a kite in my Nike Flights\nMade 30 Racks it was just a flight\nFlew a bitch out too, it was just a night\nShorty got the booty make a nigga say, \"Whoa\"\nCan I suck your titties, tryna see how far I can go\nTry again and then again and she ain't telling me no\nSweetie tell me how you feeling, can I feel on you more?\nShe said, \"I ain't fucking for free,\" but ain't shit I can't afford\nShit, I'll pay you for it, now bounce that ass on my bungie cord\nYeah, whoopsie daisy, put a good kid in your Section.80\nTurn a baby into a lady, now here go the keys to my new Mercedes\nCause shawty she a stripper, all you got to do is tip her\nShe like ballers with some money screaming fuck them other niggas\nNow do A through Z for a G, panties go down to her feet\nPussy get wetter for me, smackin' that ass to the beat, give her that Diggity-D"}}, {"title": "Power96 Clique

Rove'\n'Cause I'm so fly but they call my god like I'm Hov'\nOh, now we in Miami with my family\nGot a bad bitch named Sandy in her panties\nGot it to be slick (?)Sandy giving Tammy (?)\n'Cause she wanna get with me and the Henny in the Hemi\nGot it in the jenny, bitches wanna get that Jimmy\n'Cause they fucking with me 'cause I got them smoking all that Britney\nOn that Whitney or that Bobby\nSo Rappin' is my hobby\nI got five bitches, my security in the lobby\n'Cause they talking bout Rocky\nThey tryna catch a body\nI'm like woah kemosabe\nGot that chopper leave you sloppy\nNigga

Ruger\nNiggas stupid scuba diving\nNigga you saliva\nI'm the who is hotter\nAnd niggas know I could do your father(?)\nI could do your papa, do you proper\nI could do your doctor\nIf you need it,

okay lets rock and roll this\nTime to go, lock, stock and two smoking barrels\nLocked and loaded\nDiamonds glowing, chart-climbing on 'em\nYou'd think I'm jumping out the window how I got 'em open\nLine around the corner, line 'em up to block and over\nTimes I even stop the smoking when it's time to focus\nMy shades, Dior, my pants, velour\nCreate, explore, expand, conquer\n\nI came, I

I'd like to give a shoutout to my niggas with the game plan\nAnd shout-outs to my niggas with escape plans\nUh, twenty bands, rain dance\nWe can either rain check or we can make plans\nPockets loaded, rocket loaded, okay lets rock and roll this\nTime to go, lock, stock and two smoking barrels\nLocked and loaded\nDiamonds glowing, chart-climbing on 'em\nYou'd think I'm jumping out the window how I got 'em open\nLine around the corner, line 'em up to block and over\nTimes I even stop the smoking when it's time to focus\nMy shades, Dior, my pants, velour\nCreate, explore, expand, conquer\n\nI came, I saw, I came, I saw\nI praise, the Lord, then break, the law\nI take, what's mine, then take, some more\nIt rains, it pours, it rains, it pours\nI came, I saw, I came, I saw\nI praise, the Lord, then break, the law\nI take, what's mine, then take, some more\nIt rains, it pours, it rains, it pours\n\nYeah, I sold, the pack, the loose, the hard (yeah)\nI listened, to X, I peeped, the bars (yeah)\nThe snakes, the rats, the cats, the dogs\nThe games, a trap, protect, your heart (yeah)\nI waited, in line, return, refine\nThe new, design, it's time, to shine\nTo shine, to shine, to shine, to shine\nI hustle, I flex, the world, is mine\nSo please, believe, allow, the greaze\nThese niggas, disease, don't speak, we squeeze\nI make, the devil, go weak, the knees\nYou hate, you're lame, your loss\n\nI came, I saw, I came, I saw\nI praise, the Lord, then break, the law\nI take, what's mine, then take, some more\nIt rains, it pours, it rains, it pours\nI came, I saw, I came, I saw\nI praise, the Lord, then break, the law\nI take, what's mine, then take, some more\nIt rains, it pours, it rains, it pours\n\nUh, she came, I came, now what's, my name?\nMy chain, my pants, my pants with the chain\nThey know, it's me, the hat and the shades\nThey heard, my voice and they ran to the stage\nMy Vans, my braids, my mans, my babe\nMy girls, my ex, my hoes that I left\nThe way, I stepped out the car, that's a flex\nGive thanks, get fresh, praise the Lord then finesse, bless\n\nI came, I saw, I came, I saw\nI praise, the Lord, then break, the law\nI take, what's mine, then take, some more\nIt rains, it pours, it rains, it pours\nI came, I saw, I came, I saw\nI praise, the Lord, then break, the law\nI take, what's mine, then take, some more\nIt rains, it pours, it rains,

And I get a uh?\nYou know I got that camouflage on\nAnd I came to war, bring your guns on\nAnd I'm a full foot long like a footlong\nFrom Subway, remember my young days\nI'm too on!\nThrough the glisten and glamours\nWe pose for the cameras\nGhetto niggas with me, they pose with their hammers\nGhetto girls with me, pink toes in the sandals\nNo dirty laundry, get your nose out my hamper!\nClothes in my hamper? Bathing Ape camouflage\nBrands from Japan, you would think I was a samurai\nDrop crotch Jeremy Scott pants, rich as Hammertime\nGetting dirty money but I keep my hands sanitized\nShout out to my mom, give props to my pops\nCause my dad made this muthafuckin swag that I got\nNiggas getting mad cause we brag to the top\nYou mad cause you you, I'm glad that we...not"}}, {"title": "Purity", "album": "TESTING", "year": "2018-05-25", "lyrics": "I've been busy (busy, busy)\nI've been fuckin' busy, I've been busy fuckin'\nI've been all kinds of busy, or sorta kinda busy\nLike shorty is we fuckin'? Well if not then fuck it\nApologies to the fam, we thought we ducked 'em\nSaid I was in a rush but I was busy rushin'\nIt's busy shit, busy that, busy this\nAnd I need a minute (hold on)\n\nSee this what that voice in your head says\nWhen you try to get peace of mind\n\"I gotta find peace of mind\" (ooh, going to find)\n\"I gotta find peace of mind\" (I'm going to find)\n\"I gotta find peace of mind\" (yeah)\n\nSpendin' time spinnin' out toward, a desire that wasn't pure\nBorn before the virus was cured, pitch perfect, violins on the floor\nFast forward, linings on my skull\nThis the type of design I could afford\nFast forward, bands out\nGot they hands out like they acknowledgin' the F\u00fchrer\nRewind Nas track 6, rewind dance crazes\nRead my mind, freed my mind, feed my mind, makes sense\nJust like mirrors on the wall, just like sittin' on me\nRaw in mirrors seen it all, could make two, a piece of mind\nFlickin' ash, pourin' a half, don't pour in a glass\nPour it in foam, that's white, got eggshells in my omelette\nMy earlobes, they yellow like the yolk is runnin'\nBrain on drugs, I still ain't got no piece of mind, fuck\nWoof woof, dogs in the place, loose tooth, lost in the fray\nRoof lost on the Wraith, roof lost on the way\nFreeway, no Rozay, brute force, Br\u00fct champagne\nTell the front desk to cut new keys\nReserved in the Mercer for two years, in two suites\nTook out the bed like it's fuck sleep\nI'll smack a bitch like it's hot hands\nFired the label like fuck brands\nComfortable low nigga, fuck Xans\nComfortable slow, who the fuck ran\nNothin' is sweet, nothin' in tank sweet, it's just a tank P\nSalt on a slug, soda on slugged teeth, chewing on nothing\nYou're tweakin' or somethin', you're reachin' for somethin'\nYou're speakin', speak up then, you're thinkin', you\u2019re overthinkin'\nOne blink and I'm precummin'\nThat could turn every no one into someone\n\n\"I gotta find peace of mind\" (ohh, do do, do do, oh)\n\"I gotta find peace of mind\" (oh, oh)\n\"I gotta find peace of mind\" (oh, oh)\n\"I gotta find peace of mind\" (you make my heart desire pure)\n\"I gotta find peace of mind\" (you make my heart desire pure)\nI just need peace of mind for my purity\n\"You make my heart desire pure, just tell me\"\n\"You make my heart desire pure, just tell me\"\n\nMemories burn the roaches\nCheer Hennessy for my old heads\nAmphetamines for the dosage\nKeepin' me up and focused\nJewelry cloth, my gold caps\nNY throwback like the old Fab\n\"I'm undone because\"\nLost in the Google Maps in your iMac, think my phone tapped\nHold up, hold that (hold on, my nigga, hold that\u2014) thought\nNigga, pour up soda, nigga, hold that cough, tryna hold back\nThe call had dropped when the FaceTime paused, don't call back\nCan't cope when your heart broke\nSoft-spoken, roll somethin', cop somethin', Narco\nSaint life Joan of Arc, bro, ring barcode\nTwo of everything, should have been to blame when Noah's Ark broke\nTwo more drinks of everything before the bar closed\nFace-to-face with my demons at a barstool\nHaven't checked on my niece in weeks\nMonths past and months in between since me and my sister would speak\nNot a call or visit in weeks, lost, nothin' since the September last\nSeen her September '16, man it feels like\n\"I'm undone because\"\nLose someone every release, it feels like the curse is in me (A$AP)\nPress is gone and I grief, I share with you my peace\n\n\"I'm undone because\u2014\"\n\"I'm undone because\u2014\"", "image":

Well if not then fuck it\nApologies to the fam, we thought we ducked 'em\nSaid I was in a rush but I was busy rushin'\nIt's busy shit, busy that, busy this\nAnd I need a minute (hold on)\n\nSee this what that voice in your head says\nWhen you try to get peace of mind\n\"I gotta find peace of mind\" (ooh, going to find)\n\"I gotta find peace of mind\" (I'm going to find)\n\"I gotta find peace of mind\" (yeah)\n\nSpendin' time spinnin' out toward, a desire that wasn't pure\nBorn before the virus was cured, pitch perfect, violins on the floor\nFast forward, linings on my skull\nThis the type of design I could afford\nFast forward, bands out\nGot they hands out like they acknowledgin' the F\u00fchrer\nRewind Nas track 6, rewind dance crazes\nRead my mind, freed my mind, feed my mind, makes sense\nJust like mirrors on the wall, just like sittin' on me\nRaw in mirrors seen it all, could make two, a piece of mind\nFlickin' ash, pourin' a half, don't pour in a glass\nPour it in foam, that's white, got eggshells in my omelette\nMy earlobes, they yellow like the yolk is runnin'\nBrain on drugs, I still ain't got no piece of mind, fuck\nWoof woof, dogs in the place, loose tooth, lost in the fray\nRoof lost on the Wraith, roof lost on the way\nFreeway, no Rozay, brute force, Br\u00fct champagne\nTell the front desk to cut new keys\nReserved in the Mercer for two years, in two suites\nTook out the bed like it's fuck sleep\nI'll smack a bitch like it's hot hands\nFired the label like fuck brands\nComfortable low nigga, fuck Xans\nComfortable slow, who the fuck ran\nNothin' is sweet, nothin' in tank sweet, it's just a tank P\nSalt on a slug, soda on slugged teeth, chewing on nothing\nYou're tweakin' or somethin', you're reachin' for somethin'\nYou're speakin', speak up then, you're thinkin', you\u2019re overthinkin'\nOne blink and I'm precummin'\nThat could turn every no one into someone\n\n\"I gotta find peace of mind\" (ohh, do do, do do, oh)\n\"I gotta find peace of mind\" (oh, oh)\n\"I gotta find peace of mind\" (oh, oh)\n\"I gotta find peace of mind\" (you make my heart desire pure)\n\"I gotta find peace of mind\" (you make my heart desire pure)\nI just need peace of mind for my purity\n\"You make my heart desire pure, just tell me\"\n\"You make my heart desire pure, just tell me\"\n\nMemories burn the roaches\nCheer Hennessy for my old heads\nAmphetamines for the dosage\nKeepin' me up and focused\nJewelry cloth, my gold caps\nNY throwback like the old Fab\n\"I'm undone because\"\nLost in the Google Maps in your iMac, think my phone tapped\nHold up, hold that (hold on, my nigga, hold that\u2014) thought\nNigga, pour up soda, nigga, hold that cough, tryna hold back\nThe call had dropped when the FaceTime paused, don't call back\nCan't cope when your heart broke\nSoft-spoken, roll somethin', cop somethin', Narco\nSaint life Joan of Arc, bro, ring barcode\nTwo of everything, should have been to blame when Noah's Ark broke\nTwo more drinks of everything before the bar closed\nFace-to-face with my demons at a barstool\nHaven't checked on my niece in weeks\nMonths past and months in between since me and my sister would speak\nNot a call or visit in weeks, lost, nothin' since the September last\nSeen her September '16, man it feels like\n\"I'm undone because\"\nLose someone every release, it feels like the curse is in me (A$AP)\nPress is gone and I grief, I share with you my peace\n\n\"I'm undone because\u2014\"\n\"I'm undone because\u2014\""}}, {"title": "Purple Swag", "album": null, "year":

me\nSpaceGhostPurrp and I put your bitch to sleep\nMe and my twin at it again with this phonk\nSipping on gin, living in sin, lean in the trunk\nRIP to Screw, rest in peace to Pimp C\nShout out to the H and that fucking SUC\nMy fucking brain is purple, nigga\n\nEverything is purple (Swag)\nEverything is purple (Swag, swag, swag)\nI said\nEverything is purple (Swag)\nEverything is purple (Swag, swag, swag)\n\nIt be that pretty mothafucka sipping that throwed\nGripping my pistol, my chrome\nHidden to hit you then splitting your wig into something\nI spit it and flip it like Bone\nNiggas ain't ready for the flow switch\nOnly Harlem nigga on his Bone shit\nTippin 4's since back in 06\nWon't you see a nigga getting throwed bitch\nTwo middle fingers to the show, bitch\nCause they selfish in the show biz\nCause they shelf kids and it's hopeless\nCareer dying quicker than a goldfish\nI be the fly young fella, Maison Martin Margiela\nBitches Cinderellas under my umbrella, I go and tell her\n\nEverything is purple (Swag)\nEverything is purple (Swag, swag, swag)\nI said\nEverything is purple (Swag)\nEverything is purple (Swag, swag, swag)\n\nAll hell here, bitch it's Satan

rap\nDriving slow, black on black\nBackwood lit, windows cracked\nDime in my lap with her hair pulled back\nAnd a hand full of diamonds all on my wrist\nMouth full of ice, pardon my lisp\nWorld full of hate is fear a few rips\nSo I open my mind and stack up my chips\nLollipop grind, whole lotta licks\nFrom paper planes to a house made of bricks\nBig ol' cold cup with codeine mix\nSo I'm so throwed and I'm still gettin' lit\nAnd everything is purple, baby\n\nI said\nEverything is purple (Swag)\nEverything is purple (Swag, swag, swag)\nI said\nEverything is purple (Swag)\nEverything is purple (Swag, swag, swag)\n\nTrill OG and I rep the South\nNigga, I rep the streets and I rep the hood\nAnd I'm grippin' grain, grippin' stains\nAnd I'm flippin' mane and it's kinda good\nI'm holdin' wood with diamonds on it\nHittin' the block and I'm grindin' on it\nWith a big ol' chain and a big ol' piece\n\u2018Cause when I'm in these streets I be shinin', homie\nHaters better get they ass behind me, homie\n\u2018Cause I'm in the front and I'm takin' charge\nAnd when I'm done, I'mma have a homie run\nAnd they be hard to find like they's El Debarge\nAnd my swag is large, extra large\nI can barely fit it up in this room\nBut don't sweat the size and don't be surprised\nWhen your bitch reminds that I'm the shit to swoon\nI lick the blunt and I pass the 'dro\nSpit my game and I smash your ho\nBut no, I ain't trick, it's no passin' dough\nThen I hop up in this slab and I mash it, bro\nI got a passion for this Southern flow\nThis that purple life and we thuggin', bro\nThese haters might not really understand it\nBut that's all good \u2018cause we love it though\nThis PAT, that's where I'm from\nThat's what I rep and that's how it go\nI roll with rocks so get up off the jock\nFrom New York to PA, this that purple flow\nIt's that swag\n\nI said\nEverything is purple (Swag)\nEverything is purple (Swag, swag, swag)\nI said\nEverything is purple (Swag)\nEverything is

call me Paul Cain\nThat's the reason why I'm with her\nThese other bitches bitter\nI'm the quickest picker-upper\nI will hit her then I'll quit her\nThen I give her to my niggas\nI'm no kidder, split her kitty litter\nFinger in her shitter\nThen forget her like we never did her\nReality, she sweatin' me\nHer fantasy is sexin' me\nJust for standin' next to me\nWill make you a celebrity\n\nDon't get

man\nTo handin' out hundred dollar bills to the doorman\nNow somebody please let the hoes in\nNow somebody please let my bros in\nBoy, you won't believe how my foes end?\nOvernight celebrities, they

Dolemite\nI remember when, I was like ten, maybe nine\nRicky had a deuce-deuce, two shotty pumps with a baby nine\nBusta had the rhymes, Puffy had the Shyne\nBone Thugs had Mo Thugs but that was the shit, that made me rhyme\nWhat's up, what's on your mind? Hold up, I'm feeling fine\nLocs got me blind, thugging like I'm Eazy-E up in his prime\nAnother young nigga with a attitude\nI guess that's why the crackers kept me after school\nRoaches on the wall, roaches on the dresser\nEverybody had roaches but our roaches ain't respect us\nOn the park bench playing checkers, sipping nectar\nGirbaud jeans with hologram straps and reflectors\nWe had cookouts and dirt bikes and dice games and fistfights\nAnd fish fries and shootouts like one Sig with two rounds\nAnd one click left two down, that's four kids but one lived\nLeft three dead, but one split, that one miss, that one snitched\nThat's everyday shit, shit we used to that\nAdd it up, do the math with your stupid ass\nDon't view me as no conscious cat, this ain't no conscious rap\nFuck the conscious crap, my mac'll push your conscience back\nI do this for my culture, penny, nickels in the sofa\nMommy watching Oprah, Daddy in the kitchen whipping soda\nCook-connect named Sosa, Spanish chick Viola hit it in the chocha\nWith the Testarossa, hit Daytona, fuck the law, we soldiers\nI'm 'bout it 'bout it, nigga ain't shit sweet about me\nThe baddest bitches on the block be even speaking 'bout me\nI'm so thuggish ruggish bringing ruckus, knucking if you bucking\nYoung and thugging, bugging showing out in public, but you love it\n\nI only got one vision, that's for kids in every color, religion\nThat listen, we gotta beat the system, stay the fuck out the prisons\nThey try to blind our vision, but we all God children, we siblings\nYou my brother, you my kin, fuck the color of your skin\n\nBack once again\nChilling in the back of the 'Lac with a pass or the gin\nFinna ask can I pass to her friend\nThen a nigga smash, I'll be damned if I ask her again\nGold slabs on the 'Lac when I spin\nThen it's back to the back of the Benz\nLean back in the back with the Henn and a crap\nWhen I tap that that, then attack, never tax, never that that\nMax on the ends, spend ends, I remember way back when\nA mothafucka used to have to borrow cash from my friends\nFriends, just to put a snack up in the fridge\nWhen I'm on, I swear to God to pay you back\nNow the kids all look up to me\nThem bitches wanna fuck with me\nMy idols say what's up to me\nFrom ugly to comfortably, suddenly\n\nIt all changed man, it was just like yesterday\nTimes was so ugly and now I'm comfortable\nI just only can thank God, suddenly\nEverything changed before my eyes by my surprise\nA$AP"}}, {"title": "Sway in the Morning Freestyle", "album": null, "year": "2015-05-28", "lyrics": "Yeah Shade 45

reply, the bank do the statements\nHad me with my savings, I was saving in my savings\nTwo or three bedroom shack I was raised in\nThe condos out in Jersey full of Jay West paintings\nTalk to the boy how you talk to the Lord\nTalk to these broads how I talk to my dog\nMarc Jacob plates, Margiela rugs\nMy boys make smores out you marshmallow thugs\nHop up out the first class, hop into that E-class\nCut raw, cut school, I ain't ever see class\nIf so, I was cutting in my nigga Steve's class\nSchool of hard knocks, graduated with a G pass\nG-Code, Street code, fake niggas; cheat code\nNiggas trying to turn fake shit: green, cheap gold\nI dont know how they do it for the freak show\nBut I ain't even go beast mode\nSo we toast\n\nFuck the pearly gates, I'm hanging by the steps\nCause my target is my goal and I'm aiming for the best\nI'm good at what I do, but I'm coming for the best spot\nOn the road to greatness, success is the next stop\nI dont even rest, (Nah) even at a rest stop\nI toast with the Gods, tell these haters take they best shot\nI'mma be that motherfucker 'till my breath stop\nI guess for now call me step pop\n\nWe toast for the night and drink for the day\nThe god shed a tear providing us rain\nWhat a shame from the pain cause we used to being slaves\nMade a change from the whips, shackles and the chains\nBut nowadays man seem a little strange\nTrade his soul for the whips and the chains, what a change!\nNo, I couldn't tell you what the difference is\nBut I could tell you what the business is\nI was getting dividends, probably spending Benjamins\nBoth kind of synonyms, in the same sentences\nTell me what a good Christian is\nBetter yet; When Christmas is\nWaiting on my presence, I must be a gift from heaven\nCause im

Saline\nI chase dreams, white man but the face green\nSame thing 'err day, 'err thing gleam\nFuck my reply, the bank do the statements\nHad me with my savings, I was saving in my savings\nTwo or three bedroom shack I was raised in\nThe condos out in Jersey full of Jay West paintings\nTalk to the boy how you talk to the Lord\nTalk to these broads how I talk to my dog\nMarc Jacob plates, Margiela rugs\nMy boys make smores out you marshmallow thugs\nHop up out the first class, hop into that E-class\nCut raw, cut school, I ain't ever see class\nIf so, I was cutting in my nigga Steve's class\nSchool of hard knocks, graduated with a G pass\nG-Code, Street code, fake niggas; cheat code\nNiggas trying to turn fake shit: green, cheap gold\nI dont know how they do it for the freak show\nBut I ain't even go beast mode\nSo we toast\n\nFuck the pearly gates, I'm hanging by the steps\nCause my target is my goal and I'm aiming for the best\nI'm good at what I do, but I'm coming for the best spot\nOn the road to greatness, success is the next stop\nI dont even rest, (Nah) even at a rest stop\nI toast with the Gods, tell these haters take they best shot\nI'mma be that motherfucker 'till my breath stop\nI guess for now call me step pop\n\nWe toast for the night and drink for the day\nThe god shed a tear providing us rain\nWhat a shame from the pain cause we used to being slaves\nMade a change from the whips, shackles and the chains\nBut nowadays man seem a little strange\nTrade his soul for the whips and the chains, what a change!\nNo, I couldn't tell you what the difference is\nBut I could tell you what the business is\nI was getting dividends, probably spending Benjamins\nBoth kind of synonyms, in the same sentences\nTell me what a good Christian is\nBetter yet; When Christmas is\nWaiting on my presence, I must be a gift from heaven\nCause im toasting with the Lord, somebody let the bitches in"}}, {"title": "Tony Tone", "album": "TESTING", "year":

that purp shit I sip up, your bitch chose, you slipped up\nI get-get my dick licked, I'm draped out, drip-dripped up\nTop of the top of the line, all on my grind, purple be easin' my mind\nWe runnin', we runnin', we gunnin', we gunnin', we're gonna hit one at a time, time\nThem bad bitches blow kisses by my earlobe\nA weirdo but I'm rare though\n\nAll these boppers wanna bop 'em, niggas wanna jock

diesel slash coke\nA$AP we the last hope, fuck it this my fast flow\nI slow it down I pick it up, blue jeans I rip 'em up\nThat's swag bitch, you mad bitch, see you in my past bitch\nI'm headed to the

Raf Simon murderers\nFashion killa word to Bigga Bars, I never heard of ya\nStill sipping candy painted whips is what I'm sitting in\nKitchen chemist whipping up that shit that get these bitches

us, keep it trilla\nMy gold teeth, my french braids, getting throwed since 10th grade\nWealth is in the mind, not the pocket, if that's the case, then I been paid\nHerringbone chain, my gold frames, my Cartiers, you small change\nYou bitch made, I'm old school like gemstars and switchblades\nI spit game, I get paid, a pimp game\nI be, I be that pretty muthafucka, A$AP is just my nickname\n(I'm comin' down when I'm tippin' on them 4's\nCause we shittin' on these, shittin' on these niggas and these hoes)\nCause that purp shit I sip up, your bitch chose, you slipped up\nI get-get my dick licked, I'm draped out, drip-dripped up\nTop of the top of the line, all on my grind, purple be easin' my mind\nWe runnin', we runnin', we gunnin', we gunnin', we're gonna hit one at a time, time\nThem bad bitches blow kisses by my earlobe\nA weirdo but I'm rare though\n\nAll these boppers wanna bop 'em, niggas wanna jock 'em\nNot a red light or a city cop that can stop 'em\nGoing broke is not an option, always on that cash flow\nShe used to call me asshole, now she drop that ass low\nFuck it man I'm past dope, sour diesel slash coke\nA$AP we the last hope, fuck it this my fast flow\nI slow it down I pick it up, blue jeans I rip 'em up\nThat's swag bitch, you mad bitch, see you in my past bitch\nI'm headed to the future, Twelvyy ain't no loser\nMixing up that syrup, call it Punky Brewster\nI'm slurring wussup, don't tell me to shut up\nI ain't tryna start shit, but man I'm really fucked up\nI lucked up, I see it as a come up\nI'm on my job man, I see you when the sun's up\nHuh, young niggas run everything\nA$AP to the top and these bitches love everything\n\nGod bless America, my flow is scarier\nStyle wild like my nigga Common after Erykah\nYour bitch, I'm in bed with her, head so good\nMake a nigga feel good to the point I wanna marry her\nBut I be on my pimping shit, check out my limp and shit\nI be getting money, getting money, can you dig it, bitch?\nHoes get on my pimping ship all aboard, all aboard\nEast coast mothafuckas making all the noise, all the noise\nI know you niggas heard of us, Raf Simon murderers\nFashion killa word to Bigga Bars, I never heard of ya\nStill sipping candy painted whips is what I'm sitting in\nKitchen chemist whipping up that shit that get these bitches in\nNew York Nasty flow, that's a little bit of crack mixed in with a fifth of Hen\nBusiness man, middle finger to your fucking business, man\nGreat adventure shit, rollercoasting take a flick of this\nMotion picture shit, bitch I grind like a skater do\nAlways $trive

(Wassup)\n\nBack once again, sipping Henn, mixed with juice and gin\nBitches in, couple lady friends countin Benjamins\nSpinners spin, on the 20-twins that Mercedes-Benz\nDividends made a change of plans well that all depends\nShout-out my parolees and I smoke that OG\nKush mothafuck the police, all my niggas rock gold teeth\nSo hood and we so street, sipping on that codeine\nWe hustle hard no sleep, your bitch loose that's no leash\nI ain't talking 'bout no money, I ain't talking 'bout no cars\nTalking 'bout no diamonds cause that shit is a fa\u00e7ade\nTimes is really hard, I fucked a couple broads\nSmoked some purple out the jars, let me tell you who we are\n\nI be that pretty mothafucka, Harlem's what I'm repping\nTell 'em quit the bitching, we gon' make it in a second\nPretty mothafucka, Harlem's what I'm repping\nTell 'em quit the bitching we gon' make it in a second\nSee me in the hood the gangstas saying wassup (Wassup)\n\nPretty nigga in some shit you never hear of\nOnly thing bigger than my ego is my mirror\nYeah, clothes getting weirder\nMoney get longer, pretty nigga pin your hair up\nThe nerve of this dude\nBut I'm cool as a fan, 40 ounce full of brew\n\nI be that pretty mothafucka, Harlem's what I'm repping\nTell 'em quit the bitching, we gon' make it in a second\nPretty mothafucka, Harlem's what I'm repping\nTell 'em quit the bitching we gon' make it in a second\nSee me in the hood the gangstas saying wassup (Wassup)"}}, {"title": "Wavybone", "album": "AT.LONG.LAST.A$AP", "year": "2015-05-26", "lyrics": "The hustle continues\nGettin' money is, gettin' money is\nPut your mind to, something you want\nGettin' money is, gettin' money is\nIt come true\n\nGettin' money is (what I do, falling in love with you)\nI thought you knew\nGettin' money is (what I do, falling in love with you)\nI thought y'all knew\nGettin' money is (what I do, falling in love with you baby)\nIt's what I do\nGettin' money is (what I do, falling in love with you)\n\nI remember all the nights\nOn different corners spittin', pitchin' water\nNow I'm richer off the shit I thought of\nFrom the home of the richest ballers\nI'm Richard Porter mixed with Mr. Porter\nThis picture all the jiggy shit I ordered\nI went to France and almost got deported\nThe fans is screaming when I hit the border\nI visit Nice like it's my sister's daughter\nVision broad, I thought of all the different kids and all\nPoor without a sip of water, time to get my shit in order\nAnd do somethin' different, gettin' tired of the same old shit\nWhen I'm spittin' lines 'bout the section lines\nI sit you kids who listen for us\nI see prison for us until we pull back, that's a true fact\nGet money, yeah I do that, thought you knew that\n\nGettin' money is (what I do, falling in love with you)\nI thought you knew\nGettin' money is (what I do, falling in love with you)\nI thought y'all knew\nGettin' money is (what I do, falling in love with you baby)\nIt's what I do\nGettin' money is (what I do, falling in love with you)\n\nCandy low slider, I'm a soul survivor\nKeep a Sweet in my visor, bitch I'm keepin' it liver\nThan the average Joe, I think fast, talk slow\nHe think he want a war but he don't really wanna go\nNeed to get me some head from Sheryl Crow\nA helluva blow, from a millionaire snow\nYou can waste your time, with the goody goody two shoes\nNow I'm puttin' em on the spot, I give a ho the blues\nI'm touchin' on her cot, I put her on the block\nYou think I'm startin' over, bitch I ain't never stop\nPoppin' the trunk, and testin' the pills\nDon't give a fuck bout where you're from\nDon't give a fuck bout how you feel\n\nGettin' money is (what I do, falling in love with you)\nI thought you knew\nGettin' money is (what I do, falling in love with you)\nI thought y'all knew\nGettin' money is (what I do, falling in love with you baby)\nIt's what I do\nGettin' money is (what I do, falling in love with you)\n\nI'm the best still in this game, I'm rich bitch like Rick James\nGot a group of hoes in MIA, get a condo in Biscayne\nThe Louis store, I drop bands, the Gucci store, I drop bands\nPrada store, I went HAM, my left wrist, it cost a Lam'\nYour girlfriend a groupie, like Trident, she wanna chew me\nHell naw I ain't cuffin' 'em, I'm a dog just like Snoopy\nAnd when I leave the mall, it's sold out, erryday shoppin'\nTaylor Gang, blowin' money, $50,000 on wrist watches\n$100,000 in a plastic bag, we takin' off, bitch pack your bags\nBitch I came from having nothin', damn right I have to brag\nTry me and I'll pop your ass, stupid nigga, get a body bag\nAll I talk is money ho, rich niggas don't lollygag\n\nGettin' money is (what I do, falling in love with you)\nI thought you knew\nGettin' money is (what I do, falling in love with you)\nI thought y'all knew\nGettin' money is (what I do, falling in love with you baby)\nIt's what I do\nGettin' money is (what I do, falling in love with you)\n\nGettin' money is the main reason most people wake up\nThe root of why most relationships is startin' break ups\nWhile niggas get haircuts, and bitches do makeup\nWhile we take their penitentiary chances, we shake up\nIt's an everyday struggle for the almighty dollar\nSome is in the streets and some is workin' blue collar\nReal up in your field and man it make you wanna holler\nSay your prayer for a player, amen, inshallah\nBeen like that, ain't a damn thing change\nMoney on mind, the red of my brain\nCandy paint is gonna drip that stain\nLean on left, the grip of my grain\nSee ain't a damn thing change but the weather\nSo If you ain't breakin' bread then we can't even sit together\n\nGettin' money is (what I, do)", "image":

you)\nI thought you knew\nGettin' money is (what I do, falling in love with you)\nI thought y'all knew\nGettin' money is (what I do, falling in love with you baby)\nIt's what I do\nGettin' money is (what I do, falling in love with you)\n\nI remember all the nights\nOn different corners spittin', pitchin' water\nNow I'm richer off the shit I thought of\nFrom the home of the richest ballers\nI'm Richard Porter mixed with Mr. Porter\nThis picture all the jiggy shit I ordered\nI went to France and almost got deported\nThe fans is screaming when I hit the border\nI visit Nice like it's my sister's daughter\nVision broad, I thought of all the different kids and all\nPoor without a sip of water, time to get my shit in order\nAnd do somethin' different, gettin' tired of the same old shit\nWhen I'm spittin' lines 'bout the section lines\nI sit you kids who listen for us\nI see prison for us until we pull back, that's a true fact\nGet money, yeah I do that, thought you knew that\n\nGettin' money is (what I do, falling in love with you)\nI thought you knew\nGettin' money is (what I do, falling in love with you)\nI thought y'all knew\nGettin' money is (what I do, falling in love with you baby)\nIt's what I do\nGettin' money is (what I do, falling in love with you)\n\nCandy low slider, I'm a soul survivor\nKeep a Sweet in my visor, bitch I'm keepin' it liver\nThan the average Joe, I think fast, talk slow\nHe think he want a war but he don't really wanna go\nNeed to get me some head from Sheryl Crow\nA helluva blow, from a millionaire snow\nYou can waste your time, with the goody goody two shoes\nNow I'm puttin' em on the spot, I give a ho the blues\nI'm touchin' on her cot, I put her on the block\nYou think I'm startin' over, bitch I ain't never stop\nPoppin' the trunk, and testin' the pills\nDon't give a fuck bout where you're from\nDon't give a fuck bout how you feel\n\nGettin' money is (what I do, falling in love with you)\nI thought you knew\nGettin' money is (what I do, falling in love with you)\nI thought y'all knew\nGettin' money is (what I do, falling in love with you baby)\nIt's what I do\nGettin' money is (what I do, falling in love with you)\n\nI'm the best still in this game, I'm rich bitch like Rick James\nGot a group of hoes in MIA, get a condo in Biscayne\nThe Louis store, I drop bands, the Gucci store, I drop bands\nPrada store, I went HAM, my left wrist, it cost a Lam'\nYour girlfriend a groupie, like Trident, she wanna chew me\nHell naw I ain't cuffin' 'em, I'm a dog just like Snoopy\nAnd when I leave the mall, it's sold out, erryday shoppin'\nTaylor Gang, blowin' money, $50,000 on wrist watches\n$100,000 in a plastic bag, we takin' off, bitch pack your bags\nBitch I came from having nothin', damn right I have to brag\nTry me and I'll pop your ass, stupid nigga, get a body bag\nAll I talk is money ho, rich niggas don't lollygag\n\nGettin' money is (what I do, falling in love with you)\nI thought you knew\nGettin' money is (what I do, falling in love with you)\nI thought y'all knew\nGettin' money is (what I do, falling in love with you baby)\nIt's what I do\nGettin' money is (what I do, falling in love with you)\n\nGettin' money is the main reason most people wake up\nThe root of why most relationships is startin' break ups\nWhile niggas get haircuts, and bitches do makeup\nWhile we take their penitentiary chances, we shake up\nIt's an everyday struggle for the almighty dollar\nSome is in the streets and some is workin' blue collar\nReal up in your field and man it make you wanna holler\nSay your prayer for a player, amen, inshallah\nBeen like that, ain't a damn thing change\nMoney on mind, the red of my brain\nCandy paint is gonna drip that stain\nLean on left, the grip of my grain\nSee ain't a damn thing change but the weather\nSo If you ain't breakin' bread then we can't even sit together\n\nGettin' money is (what I, do)"}}, {"title": "West Side Highway", "album":

time\nI lived vicariously\nI can't sing for ish\n\nWho's gonna save my soul now?\nWho's gonna save my soul now?\nI wonder if I live to grow old now?\nGetting high 'cause I feel so low now\nLemme freestyle\n\nIt made me feel like somebody\nLike somebody else, yeah\nAlthough we were imitated often\nFelt like I was being myself\nOh, how could this be?\nAll of this time I had to keep this shit G\nPardon my language, I'm sorry y'all\nWho's gonna save my dro now?\nWho's gonna blaze my smoke now?\nI wonder if I'll be pretty forever ya'll\nFeeling high now I feel so low down\n\nI need the marijuana where the trees, leave the trees\nYou're chillin' in the Live Lounge and you with me\nA-S-A-P, got a hat to the back\nAnd it's white 'cause I got a white collar shirt to match\nGot a blue trench, chickens on my *ahh\nNever gave her up, 'cause the clock won't tick\nIf my, ,don't stick, all up in your chicken\nEverybody know me, I'm here take your flexin\nAnd I love the UK, shoot at yo toupee\nRiding round, Chicago like Lupe\nAnd it's a Fiasco, your man is an asshole\nAnd I could get busy but they dizzy like Rascal\nAnd this is off the top, when I'm chillin' in the Live Lounge\nYou already know, ain't steppin' in the spot now\nI gotta come, shut it down, up in Londontown\nI need to beat the loop man, I need another round\nOh, how could this be?\nI feel like whining when I'm singin\nI live vicariously\nYa'll ready?\n\nWho's gonna save my hoes now?\nWho's gonna save my soul now?\nI wonder if I live to grow old now\nThey say I move back so I gotta slow down\nI hope ya'll

Skrillex\nYou know we finna kill it, A$AP we the trillest\nYou don't really want that Glock boy\nYou don't really wanna feel them shots boy\nYou a b-boy, I'm a block boy, I'm a D boy, I'm a hot
